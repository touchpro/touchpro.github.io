The report I got says that this story was featured on <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i>.  A cook who was obsessed with Annette Huddle, a secretary at this country club, raped and murdered her and dumped her body in the Olentangy River.  Today people report seeing her spirit on the golf course and in the kitchen.
<p>
The case was also featured on the very first episode of <i>America's Most Wanted</i> since the cook was also wanted for murder in California.
