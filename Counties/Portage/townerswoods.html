This park west of Ravenna has only been around since the mid 1970s, but in that time it's gathered more than its share of ghostly legends.  Many are vague and hard to pin down; for instance, the railroad tracks that run through the park might be travelled by the same ghostly train that haunts <a href = "ghosthollow.html">Ghost Hollow</a>.  But people do say that the Hopewell Indian Mound on park land is haunted by one of its inhabitants--a princess--who is very aggressive toward anyone who disturbs her rest.  Some teenagers who camped on the mound back in the 50s found scratch marks on their car.  Another legend says that the ghost of a pioneer widow wanders the trails.  She was murdered more than a century ago in a land dispute.
