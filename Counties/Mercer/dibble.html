This haunted house near Celina was torn down years ago, but the story behind it is more than worth recalling.  Perhaps the ghost still roams the area.
<p>
The Dibble family was an early heir to the Brach's candy fortune.  When the parents died of natural causes, they left the bulk of the estate to their eldest daughter, who never married.  Her two younger brothers went through their smaller portions of the inheritance quickly, and when she refused to give them anymore, they plotted to kill her.
<p>
They finally poisoned her and threw her body into a well on the property.  The older son then got control of the money, which made his brother very jealous.  Eventually the younger brother killed him in the farm's slaughterhouse.  Unable to live with the guilt of fratricide, he hung himself.
<p>
Now the whole Dibble family is together again in the tiny cemetery down the road--all except for the youngest son, who is buried outside the property.  The cemetery is Catholic, and according to Catholic tradition suicides--mortal sinners--cannot be buried in hallowed ground.
<p>
The cemetery is said to be a very dark place, but it was the old house and surrounding farm which were the most haunted.  Here's a quote from someone whose mother grew up near the Dibble House and was familiar with its many hauntings:

My mom said that even though the house was totally abandoned, certain areas always looked as if they had been freshly scrubbed.  The baluster on the stairs was always highly polished--not just dusted but actually polished.  Supposedly, the sister kept a spotless house.  Also, there were curtains still hanging in the bedroom that had belonged to her.  The curtains would part as if someone had pulled them back.  I skeptically questioned my mom about this point--you know, drafts and the such.  She said that there was a difference between someone parting the curtains to look out and the wind blowing them aside.  Also, bones were visible at the bottom of the old well--whether human or animal, I don't know.  I've heard from several people that saw the well that the woman's face would appear to float up from it's depths.  For a long time, a portion of the rope that the brother used to hang himself was still wrapped around a high rafter.  The slaughterhouse where the first brother was murdered had ax marked at an odd angle--about the area of a man's head area.  Also, bloodstains were at a level higher than normal for slaughtering, say, chickens.

Interesting, scary stuff.  Take a walk around the old farm sometime and let me know if you see anything.
