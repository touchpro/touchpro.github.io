Yet another haunted cemetery stands at the corner of Mendon Road and the self-explanatory Mercer Van Wert County Line Road.  This haunting functions very mechanically; if one person stands at the center, and another walks backwards around the cemetery, the person inside will disappear.  This has to be an easy one to disprove, but hey, it's still interesting.

Across the street from this cemetery is a shuttered church.  Teenage legend has it that you can see hell through one of its windows.  According to reports I've heard, the owner of the property and the local police are very protective of this extremely cool-looking church, so be careful.
