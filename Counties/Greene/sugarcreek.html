The banks of the Little Sugar Creek in Bellbrook are said to be haunted by the ghost of a girl who had the town's mayor's illegitimate child.  She was abandoned by the mayor so she jumped into the creek with her baby.  Now, on foggy nights in June (for some reason), she wanders the banks with her baby in her arms, singing to it.
