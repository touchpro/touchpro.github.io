The Olde Trail Tavern in Yellow Springs, built in 1827, is haunted by a sinister woman in blue, who has never been seen by a woman but creates a dark atmosphere in the Tavern whenever she makes herself known.  She knocks things off walls and and makes strange noises.  The only murder in the house's history was that of a baker in the front room, which used to be a bakery.  Maybe the woman in blue is still angry at losing her lover.
