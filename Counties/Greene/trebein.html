Trebein Road, near Byron in Greene County, is said to be haunted by the spirit of a woman who died when her carriage hit a rock and flung her onto the ground to break her neck on her wedding day.  Her grieving father and fiancee dug the rock out and rolled it off the side of the road, where it still is today.  Some say the lady in white is transparent, but most agree that she looks just like a normal woman.  It's hard to say when she'll appear; some say it must be on her birthday, or the anniversary of her death, or her funeral.  Drive up and down the road sometime and tell me if you see her.
