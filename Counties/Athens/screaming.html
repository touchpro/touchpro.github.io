The place where a house once stood outside Athens is widely known as Screaming Hollow.  According to legend, the woman who lived there died when her furnace exploded as she filled it with coal.  Now the clearing at the dead-end of her old driveway is plagued by the sounds of her final screams, and the woman herself sometimes appears, running around frantically while flames consume her.  Screaming Hollow is said to be "on or near" Luhrig Road just outside Athens.  More information about this one would be appreciated.
