Wolf Cemetery in Haydenville is said to be haunted by the witch or warlock who was supposedly burned and buried there.  His/Her grave is said to be the big one with a flat top, and if you touch it, you might just get sucked into a scary netherworld of witches and warlocks and stuff.  I'm not making this up.
