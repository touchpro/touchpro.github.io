A hike through the Ash Cave region of the Hocking Hills might bring you into contact with a ghostly woman in 1920s clothing.  Her identity is a mystery, but she has been seen peeking out from behind large trees at hiking groups.
<p>
Also regularly encountered at this park are greenish-yellow lights that dance, swirl around each other, and disappear.  They often appear at dusk.
