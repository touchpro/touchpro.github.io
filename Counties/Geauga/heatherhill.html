Area C of Chardon's Heather Hill Hospital is haunted by the "knicker boy," a little boy in old-fashioned knickers who runs around and sometimes has conversations with hospital workers.
<p>
A hospital employee who I heard from tells me that the old parts of the hospital, including sections E, F, and D, are particularly haunted, and that she occasionally hears her name being called when alone in these sections.  She also mentions a nauseating smell which sometimes appears out of nowhere when she's there.  Interesting stuff.
