The attic of the Steven Guthrie House in Zanesville is said to be haunted by ghostly whispers.
<p>
After much consideration, I think this might need to be removed from my list of hauntings.  Who is Steven Guthrie?  Is this just somebody who told somebody his house was haunted?  It's mentioned in a book I used for research, but that's my only source.  Look up "Steven Guthrie" plus Zanesville on Google and you'll find this website and its imitators, nothing more.
