The old Moxahala Burial Ground in the Putnam section of Zanesville is said to be haunted by the ghost of a woman known as Miss Arnold.  She died young and was buried here, only to have her body stolen not long thereafter.  Dr. Connant, a local physician, was arrested along with several of his students when the doctor's horse handler found the body under a haystack on his property.  When the town marshall went for the body, he found that it had vanished.  Today Miss Arnold's restless spirit haunts the burial ground where she should be buried.
