A certain senior citizens' recreation center in Zanesville is said to be haunted by the ghost of John C. Hazlett, whose house once stood on the site.  Hazlett led volunteer troops from Zanesville in the Civil War, and was mortally wounded by a musketball at the battle of Stone's River, Tennessee.  He was buried near his old house, which was later replaced by the church which would become the senior center.
