A very cool but difficult-to-locate legend comes to us from Champaign County and the banks of King's Creek.  The Creek was named after a Shawnee general called "His Royal Highness" by Logan's men.  It was assumed that he was a king because he wore nicer clothes than anyone else.  The "king" ambushed Logan's troop, but his gun misfired, giving one of the soldiers a chance to blow his face off.  To this day it is said that his ghost sits high in the branches of a particular honey locust tree on a bank of the creek; pass too closely by on certain nights and he will let loose a terrifying scream.
