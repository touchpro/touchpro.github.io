After his assassination in Washington, President Lincoln's body was transported by rail back to Illinois for burial.  It laid in state in Cleveland and Columbus and then headed west.
<p>
In Urbana, in Champaign County, the train paused for fifteen minutes while crowds watched from the sides of the rails.  Then it moved on.
<p>
Regularly in the month of April Lincoln's funeral train appears on the tracks in Urbana, draped in black, with a crew of grinning skeletons.  Halfway down the train is Lincoln's coffin, surrounded by blue-coated skeletons.  It passes silently, and clocks in the area stop while it does so.  Later they're found to be five to ten minutes behind.
<p>
Ever since this one appeared in <i>Haunted Ohio</i>, people have watched for Lincoln's death train in April in Urbana.  Although few see it, one couple driving across the tracks was temporarily blinded by a spectral locomotive headlamp.  Maybe it was Lincoln's train.
