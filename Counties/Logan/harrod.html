To understand why Harrod Cemetery is haunted, you have to know the story of Logan County's evil <a href = "hatchetman.html">Hatchet Man</a>, so click away and read his complete story.  He murdered two wives and two children in just a few years, and now he stalks Township Road 56.
<p>
His burial spot, however, is at Harrod Cemetery, where the gravestone he shares with his murdered wife and kids is said to glow with a ghastly light on certain nights.
