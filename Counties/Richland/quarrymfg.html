This plant on Route 545 near Olivesburg has been closed down for years.  When functional, they made cement blocks for use in railroad construction projects, and formed metal rods out of molten iron.
<p>
The ghost story here is a horrifying one.  Sometime around World War Two, one of the chains on the large iron kettle broke and white-hot molten metal splashed onto five workers.  They were so badly injured that they couldn't call for help and instead died slow deaths on the factory floor.  When they were found, their bodies were immersed in solid iron.
<p>
Now, if you visit the old plant at night, you're likely to find yourself locked in.  The spirits will talk to you and share some of the agony of their final moments with you.
