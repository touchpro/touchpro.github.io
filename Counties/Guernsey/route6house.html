An abandoned house on Route 6 just outside Helena is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of a family that was slaughtered there.  The husband is reputed to have murdered his family, hung them in the barn, and then committed suicide.
<p>
Unfortunately, this house has been razed.  Perhaps the ghosts still roam the area.
