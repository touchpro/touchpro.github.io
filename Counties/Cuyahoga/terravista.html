Valley View's Terra Vista Cemetery--also called Tinker's Creek Cemetery--is said to be haunted.  It has a reputation for cult activity, but that may owe more to its spooky, isolated setting than anything else.  Witches are said to conduct services here.  The gravestones are arranged roughly in a pentagram formation.  A house far behind is said to have been the site of a suicide pact between several teenagers, and a woman's screaming can be heard there as a result.  I've heard from a lot of people who have seen or heard things there, so I'd have to say it rates pretty high on the spirit activity chart.

Terra Vista is at the end of a gravel driveway next to the Valley View church on Canal Road.  While you're there, check out the <a href = "abfarmhouse.html">abandoned farmhouse</a> nearby.
