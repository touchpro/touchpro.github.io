Lockkeeper's Inn in Valley View was once called Sophie's Bar and is today the Ohio and Erie Canal Museum.  On May 24, 1956, Sophie herself was found dead with a gun nearby.  Three shots had been fired, but only one hit her.  It was ruled suicide, but doubts still linger--especially because Sophie's ghost haunts the building.  I hear that the building is empty today; might be worth checking out sometime.
