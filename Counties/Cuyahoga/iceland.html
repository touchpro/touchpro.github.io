Strongsville's skating rink Iceland USA used to be an indoor recreation center with tennis courts, and apparently someone is still playing tennis there, because employees distinctly hear the sounds of a game when the arena is still.  This is the least frightening manifestation of their apparent haunting, though; the most active part seems to be the locker room, where the curtains swing back and forth as if someone has passed through even when no one has, and the occasional banging sound comes from the metal lockers themselves.  Footsteps sometimes follow closely behind the employees when they make their rounds after closing.  No one is sure exactly who or what is haunting Iceland, but its presence has been felt by most of the workers at one time or another.
