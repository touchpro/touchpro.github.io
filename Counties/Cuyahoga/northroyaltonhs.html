At 4:25 every Friday in the hallway near the old gym, the ghostly sounds of a murder can be heard.  First is the sound of a boy coming down the hall, dribbling a basketball.  A moment later you can hear him screaming and banging on the lockers.  Supposedly a freshman was murdered by two seniors in a prank gone wrong back in the 1970s, shortly before a big football game against rival Brecksville.  Now the boy's death can be heard, re-enacted once a week by his ghost in the hall at North Royalton High School.
