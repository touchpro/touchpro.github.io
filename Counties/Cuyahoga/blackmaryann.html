A young girl named Mary Ann haunts an alley on Cleveland's west side, near the old farmer's market on West 25th Street.  She was raped and murdered in the dark alley sometime in the 1920s or 30s, and shortly thereafter, people living in the area began to see her ghost.  She appears dressed all in black, and does not speak, only stares.  They say she is hunting for her killer, but she also seems to be friendly enough to have helped a few other girls over the years.  One took a shortcut through the alley and would have fallen through an open manhole had she not been beckoned over by Black Mary Ann.  On hot stuffy nights you might be able to see her, staring bleakly from the haunted alley on West 25th.
