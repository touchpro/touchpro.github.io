Cleveland's Old Chestnut Grove Cemetery is the site of multiple hauntings.  The grave of a witch is located there, next to a big, old tree, marked only by a fence which surrounds the place where there should be a gravestone.  The ground is sunken in above where she's buried.  It's said that if you get too close to her grave, "something terrible" will happen to you.
<p>
In addition, the back of the cemetery, where the older markers are located along the Rocky River, is haunted by mysterious lights late at night.
