A rather confusing story comes out of Greenfield in Highland County.  Supposedly a woman was walking on a bridge, nursing her baby, when a train struck and killed them.  Today, it's said that if you <i>drive to the bridge</i> and honk your horn, you'll hear the baby begin to cry and then the mother, shushing it.  But if it's a railroad trestle, how can you drive on it?  Some reports say it was an ordinary bridge on Gormley Road near the border with Fayette County, but if it was, how did the train hit her?  At any rate, voices haunt the bridge.
