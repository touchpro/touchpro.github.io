A phantom chandelier is spotted through the window of this high school in Greenfield.  The Mr. McClain after whom it was named had a wife who always wanted a chandelier in the front hallway of the school.  After her death the chandelier began to materialize.  It's visible through a second-floor window, above the entrance on the Sixth Street side.
