The "hollow" area around Postboy Road in southern Tuscarawas County is haunted by the postboy who is its namesake.  Houses in the area report strange goings-on of the same general type, which leads people to believe that they're all attributable to this one tragedy.
<p>
The postboy was delivering mail, either on foot or on horseback, in the days when mail delivery was a much more arduous task than it is today.  He was heading for a local tavern which was an exchange point on the mail route; the tavern still stands today, as a private residence.  Before he got there, however, a bandit killed him and stole his parcels.  Legend says the robber waited for him while hiding behind a huge tree--a tree which once stood in the middle of the highway that's now Postboy Road.  He was later seen at the tavern with the mail in his possession before disappearing completely.
<p>
Now the postboy's ghost haunts the valley near Newcomerstown.
