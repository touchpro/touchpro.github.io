Three ghosts inhabit this hotel in the historic village of Zoar.  The first, Alexander Gunn, lived in the hotel at the end of the nineteenth century.  Secondly, there's Mary Rouf, one of the former owners.  And then there's the ghost of another woman who is said to have been the mistress of President William McKinley, who was from nearby Canton.
<p>
Another legend says that the sounds of a ghostly party can be heard on the top floor of the hotel--the clinking of glasses, the voices of guests, the pop of a champagne bottle.
<p>
The numerous antics of the Zoar Hotel's ghosts have given it a reputation as the "most haunted" place in what is a very supernaturally active town.
