The large pyramid-shaped gravestone in a small cemetery on State Route 273 just outside tiny Ridgeway is said to be the burial site of a witch who lived in Hardin County in the 1800s.  The poem carved on her marker isn't the only scary thing about this cemetery; her ghost is said to roam at night.
<p>
The person who sent me this story is intimately involved in the legend; in 1997 he and several friends attempted to dig the witch up out of her grave.  After digging a good six feet and not finding anything they left, but were later caught, convicted, and sentenced.  The incident made the front page of the newspaper in Kenton.
