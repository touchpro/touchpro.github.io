According to various reports, including a writeup in <i>Haunted Ohio V</i>, a housing subdivision in Massillon was built atop the old Black Plague Cemetery--a leftover from one of the cholera outbreaks which swept across Ohio in the 1830s, 40s, and 50s.  The developers did a pretty poor job of clearing out the bodies; several people have encountered coffins when digging gardens or making additions to their houses.  A little girl's tombstone was found in the area.  And the ghostly occurrences are fairly widespread, ranging from voices and footsteps on the second floor to actual physical manifestations.
<p>
It turns out that the location of the subdivision is a rather poorly-kept secret in Massillon.  What's left of the cemetery is called Union Cemetery--two grassy lots between houses that serves are more of a memorial to the lost bodies than a resting place.  To find Union, turn off Route 241 (Wales Road) onto Andrew and follow it to the place where it intersects 9th Street NE.  The entrance is nearby.
