A haunted cemetery in Corning.  This is all I know.  Not the how, not the why, not the who or the when.  This cemetery is only listed here as haunted because it was mentioned in a Halloween-season article in the Zanesville <i>Times Recorder</i>.  The main article, which can be read <a href = "../../News/muskperry.html">here</a>, was about well-known hauntings in Muskingum and Perry Counties, but at the end the authors list five or six lesser-known hauntings by name only, and the only one I hadn't heard of was Beech Grove Cemetery, Corning.
<p>
Have you ever heard of this cemetery?  If so, what have you heard about it being haunted?  I'd love to know something to help flesh this legend out.  Until then it remains under investigation.
