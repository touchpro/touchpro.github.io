According to local legend in Perry County, Weaver Cave in Corning is the site of ghostly screams--those of people killed by the Ku Klux Klan years ago.  For several years this has been one of the legends I've had the most difficulty finding information on.
<p>
I have, however, heard from a handful of people with information about the cave.  As far as I can tell, it is located on the Weaver property at the top of East Hill in Corning.  Weaver Cave is also known locally as Devil's Pit.
<p>
With names like this you'd think the cave is at least big enough to walk around in, but apparently it is little more than a rock overhang along a creek.  There are several cave-like recesses like this in the immediate area, so determining which is the right one is difficult--if not impossible.
