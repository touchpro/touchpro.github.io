The abandoned and heavily deteriorated Kelm House, located on Risden Road off Cherry Road outside Vermillion, is said by locals to be haunted.  The ghost story is rather vague--the house is said to be cursed for some reason--but it's been enough for local teenagers to spraypaint the place with satanic symbols.
<p>
As it turns out, the Kelm House has been demolished.  There's a shiny new place where it once stood.  Maybe the new house is haunted too.
