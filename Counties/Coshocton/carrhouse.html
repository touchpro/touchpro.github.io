The abandoned Carr House on Coshocton County's SR 83 North was the site of the murder of its owner, heavy gambler George Carr.  He was shot by his poker buddies for cheating.  Today people hear the sounds of a poker game still going on inside this house, especially the sound of cards being slapped on the table.
<p>
It turns out that Carr may be the wrong name for the house, which is owned by the Karr family, and has been occupied by Scherers and Murrays throughout its history--which, according to one source, does not include a gambling murder.  But it's still a fun story.
