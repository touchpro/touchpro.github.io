UPDATE:

Yes, Virginia, there was a Cletus P. Reese, and yes, he murdered at least three people and buried them on his farm--an area now called "Murder Ridge."  Watch for a big update here in the very near future.

Ghostly occurrences near Nellie, in NW Coshocton County, are usually associated with Murder Ridge, a stripped-out ravine area which was purchased from its property owners years ago and mined to death.  Now very few people live in the vicinity--and it's no wonder, once you know how Murder Ridge got its name.

<p>
It seems the Reese family lived outside Walhonding with their only son, a big redneck mechanic named--according to some reports--Cletis.  Cletis killed travellers on Route 26 who were unlucky enough to break down.  He'd use his tow truck to bring their car back to his garage, then murder and cannibalize the people and store them back at his farmhouse.  The car was his prize; he'd disassemble it and sell the parts.  It was only when he got lazy and tried to sell his victims' cars whole at his used car lot that he finally got caught.  He ended up with a tally of eight or nine victims before being arrested, convicted, and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison at the <a href = "../../Counties/Allen/limacorrectional.html">Lima Correctional Institute</a>.
<p>
For a long time I wondered on this page whether or not "Cletis" really existed.  Since then I've gotten so many e-mail responses affirming his reality that I'm very nearly convinced.  Many people seem to recall the actual events associated with Murder Ridge, and those who weren't alive at the time still know a lot about the apparently-true case.  I've even heard from someone who claims to be related to the guy through a grandfather.  So...my next step is to seek out the original newspaper articles about Cletis (which does, in fact, seem to be his real name; the fake-hillbilly sound of the name "Cletis" is half of what made me think the whole thing was a fiction in the first place) and post the results of that research here for all to see.  It would be interesting to find out that such an outlandish ghost story is to some extent based on actual fact.
<p>
If you have any information which would help in this research, please drop me a line at <a href = "mailto:  ">  </a>.  It would be helpful to know more specifically <i>when</i> Cletis did his killings, since a particular date, month, season, or even year would enable me to browse the newspaper archives for information.  The 1950s are often mentioned, which would mean that he's probably not incarcerated anymore, but anything less general than that would be great to know.  And keep checking back for updates as I learn more about the true history of Murder Ridge.
