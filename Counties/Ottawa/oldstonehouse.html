The Old Stone House on the Lake Bed and Breakfast (417 West Main Street, Marblehead; (419) 798-5922) was once owned by the Clemons family, which had thirteen kids, 65+ grandkids, and 300+ great-grandkids.  No one could agree who would get the house, so they sold it.  Today it's a bed and breakfast which is haunted by a little girl.  She appears as a white mist.
