A ghost named Amy haunts Lick Road near Cincinnati.  The story goes that Amy was murdered at the age of 30 by her boyfriend on Kemper Road.  Her body was found at the end of Lick Road, just off of Kemper.  If you park at the end of Lick Road facing the woods, your windows will steam up and the word "HELP" will be written in the condensation.
<p>
To reach this area, take I-275 West to the Colerain Avenue exit.  Turn right at the light and then right onto Kemper.
