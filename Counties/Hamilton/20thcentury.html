This theater, named for 20th Century Fox movie studios, opened in 1941 and showed movies until 1983 in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Oakley.  It's been under renovation for a few years.  The ghost is that of an old projectionist who dropped dead in the booth; he gets the blame for problems with the projector and other mysterious sounds around the theater.
