You'll find this four-star hotel near Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati.  It's a national historic landmark and a well-known masterpiece of art deco architecture, featuring such strange attractions as a Hall of Mirrors.  The restaurant there is the only Mobil four-star, four-diamond rated restaurant in southern Ohio.  So you just can't go wrong if you've got reservations at the Omni Netherland, apparently.

Naturally, the Omni has its very own ghost story.  It is said to be haunted by the "woman in green," who is particularly fond of the lobby, the overlook, and the old chapel.  She was supposed to be married in the chapel, it seems, but her husband-to-be was killed in the original construction of the hotel.  Now employees see the woman in green from time to time.  One story (and this is a third- or fourth-hand story, so make of it what you will) has a hotel worker doing his early-morning rounds when the temperature dropped suddenly and he felt a cold hand on his shoulder, followed by a woman's whispered plea:  "Help me."  He quit the next day.
