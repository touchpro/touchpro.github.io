When the town of Westwood was absorbed into Cincinnati, a devoted security guard named Wesley who was fired hung himself in the Town Hall.  Today the building is used for plays and is said to be haunted by his ghost, which rearranges things and is generally mischevious.  He's also sighted sometimes on the balcony of the building, which today is used as a recreation center.
