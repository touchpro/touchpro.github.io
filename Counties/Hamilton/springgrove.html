At Lot 100 of this major Cincinnati cemetery there is a bust of a man which is said to contain his real eyes.  The legend says that its head will turn to look at you as you pass by.  After much searching I received the photo above, which I'm assured is of the bust.  Look for it next time you're in Spring Grove Cemetery--it might be looking for you.

Another Spring Grove story I heard tells of a groundskeeper who was mowing the old section and thought he saw hands poking out of the ground as his mower went past.  Ghost or hallucination?
