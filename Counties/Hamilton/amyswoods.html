Just west of Cincinnati, near <a href = "buffaloridge.html">Buffalo Ridge</a>, <a href = "../../GhostTowns/tinytown.html">Tiny Town</a>, and the Rumpke Dump, there is a haunted patch of woods known as Amy's Woods.  Amy herself haunts the area, where she was raped and murdered years ago.  If you stop on the road near her woods, flash your lights three times, and then turn them off, you'll hear her scream and see her run across the road.  The road, I'm told, is Blue Rock Road in western Hamilton County.
