Habits in Oakley was the scene of a grisly murder several years ago, when it was a pub.  The owner and a crooked cop were in cahoots to fence some stolen merchandise, but the deal went sour and the owner shot the cop to death in a basement room.  The owner had a long rap sheet for burglary but managed somehow to stay out of prison.  After the murder, the bar owner ended up getting shot in an alley by an assailant or assailants who were never caught.
<p>
Now the basement of the place is haunted by a ghost who flicks through the air and throws things.  Batteries drain quickly there, as if some electrical force is acting on them.
