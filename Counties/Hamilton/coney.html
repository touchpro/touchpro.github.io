Hamilton County's Coney Island began as a scenic peninsula along the Ohio, not far upriver from where the city limits of Cincinnati were in the 1870s.  Around that time people were picnicking there in such numbers that Parker's Grove (as it was then known) seemed an ideal spot for an actual summer park.
<p>
Moonlite Gardens in Cincinnati's Coney Island amusement park is haunted by a ghostly man and woman who look out from first-floor windows in the music pavillion.  Mysterious fogs settle over the park on clear nights.  And the ghosts of Indians can be heard chanting in the picnic area.
