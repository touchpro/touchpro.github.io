This long-neglected cemetery in Lorain County's "Sandstone Region" near Amherst is overgrown with weeds and almost impossible to see from any distance at all.  It used to be quite popular with resurrection men--grave robbers from the era before human cadavers could legally be used by medical schools.  Some inhabitants of Boot Hill have been disturbed for other reasons; just a few years back, a group of boys from Lorain came to the cemetery to dig up a body as part of a club initiation rite.  While they were digging, strange noises began to come from the bushes nearby, and small rocks rained from the sky.  This, combined with an overall eerie feeling, was enough to send the kids packing without even breaching the grave cover.
