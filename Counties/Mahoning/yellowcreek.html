The spirit of a black man killed before the Civil War haunts this park in Struthers, Ohio.  A runaway slave, he was lynched from a tree by bounty hunters from the South as an example rather than being taken back to the plantation, and now his shadowy form is seen walking through the park, head down, or sometimes coming up through the waters of Yellow Creek itself.  Jim Williams from Struthers took a photograph which seems to show a face emerging from the creek, and says he's seen the silent slave walking the pathways near the playground.

It seems that there are no cemeteries in tiny Struthers, which means that the nameless slave--who was cut down and buried on the spot by sympathetic townsfolk--occupies the only grave in town.
