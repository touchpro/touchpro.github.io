This road near Good Hope makes an abrupt and dangerous S-curve to avoid a huge, old tree.  The curve is right before a bridge which is reputed to be haunted.  Apparently so many people have died at this dangerous spot in the road that their ghosts linger and make weird noises on certain nights--including some manifestations of the "crybaby bridge."  As is so often the case, the creepy old bridge here was taken out a couple of years ago and replaced with a bland asphalt overpass.
