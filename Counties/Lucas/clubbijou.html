The ghosts of the mob days--from a time when Toledo served as an out-of-town stopover for gangsters from Chicago and Detroit--haunt this little city bar.  It was once called The Esquire, and a number of murders may have happened there when seedy underworld types patronized it during Prohibition, bringing booze down from Windsor, Ontario, or across Lake Erie.  Later, in the 1980s, a guy died from AIDS in the basement portion of the club.  His ghost, along with a ghost known as Billy who might be one of the mobsters, roams the building, appearing in shadow and locking people in the office.
