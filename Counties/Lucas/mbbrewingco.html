The building which houses Toledo's Maumee Bay Brewing Company was once called Oliver House.  When it was built in 1859, Oliver House was a big deal in Toledo.  Legend has it that Abraham Lincoln slept here.  Later, injured soldiers from the Spanish-American War were tended to in the upstairs rooms.
<p>
One room in particular at the Oliver House is said to be haunted:  the Pool Room.  A ghost called "The Captain" has been seen here in full uniform.  He also appears in a certain hallway.  During renovation the ghosts were particularly active.  And it turns out Oliver House was built on top of that old favorite, an Indian burial ground.
<p>
The Maumee Bay Brewing Company is located at 27 Broadway in Toledo, (419) 241-1253.
