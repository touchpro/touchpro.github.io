The barn at an old, abandoned farm in Ashland County is said to be haunted.  It's visible from I-71 north of Ashland.  Years ago the members of an oil exploration team were caught in a summer rainstorm and sought shelter under the roof of the barn.  They heard sounds like handfuls of gravel being thrown against the roof of the barn, even though the rain was light and no one seemed to be doing it.  Next they heard the distinctive sound of cows being milked and milk squirting into a metal bucket, coming from just a few feet away from them in the milking parlor.  No cows had been in the barn for years.
<p>
It's not known whether this specific barn is still standing in Ashland County, since the story is more than twenty-five years old.  Has anyone else heard of a haunted farm in this area?
