The Katotawa Community Club, located on Township Road 593 in Ashland County, was built in 1886 and stood for years as The Riddle School.  The creek near it is said to be haunted by the ghost of Katotawa, an Indian who was very friendly to the white settlers in the area.  Some politically incorrect settler, deciding that the only good Indian is a dead Indian, chopped Katotawa's head off and threw it into the creek.  It's said that his headless ghost now wanders the stream at night.
