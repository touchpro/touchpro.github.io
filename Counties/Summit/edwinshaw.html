A drive down Sanitarium Road near Akron will take you, not surprisingly, past the former Springfield Lake Sanitarium.  For fifty years it served as Summit County’s Tuberculosis Hospital; in the 1960s it expanded to include Sunshine Village, where wards of the Department of Children’s Services were housed.  Many of the occupants of Sunshine Village were orphans or the victims of physical/sexual abuse.
<p>
Now the hospital is used for outpatient rehabilitational programs.  Shades of its joyless past still roam the campus, however; employees report odd sounds and occasional sightings, including the sound of lunch happening in the empty mess hall.
