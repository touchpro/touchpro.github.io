Tinker's Hollow, located near Conneaut in Ashtabula County, is haunted by old Mr. Tinker, a miner who will still rides his horse-drawn buggy around sometimes late at night.  Stand under the bridge to hear him ride across overhead.  It's said that you might see his glowing green eyes, and that if you're brave enough to talk to him, he'll lead you to his secret gold stash.  Yet another version says that a woman was raped and murdered on the bridge, and if you look over the edge at night, you'll see her face reflected in the water below.

Weird lights abound in Tinker's Hollow; an account I received tells of encountering them on the hills, as well as a weird rumbling sound and car engine problems.
