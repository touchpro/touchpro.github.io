The main library in Portsmouth is haunted by a woman named Grace who sticks mainly to the balcony area, which is closed to the public.  She is either a former employee or a patron who fell to her death from the balcony, if you believe the stories.
<p>
Another ghost is that of a homeless man who is supposed to have died in the library several years ago.  He is sometimes sighted among the stacks.
<p>
Weird occurrences at the Portsmouth library include lights that go on and off and the mysterious rearrangement of books.  The phenomena seem to be restricted to the old portion of the library building, which was built in the 1900s; the multiple new additions are ghost-free.
