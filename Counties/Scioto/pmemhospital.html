A very haunted hospital in Scioto County is Portsmouth's Memorial Hospital, where my friend Hoss's aunt worked for years.  According to stories, the stairwell leading down to the morgue is plagued by regular moans and cries for help.  Also, one of the rooms where a guy who was hostile toward religion died quite often has religious pictures knocked from its walls and bibles thrown onto the floor.
