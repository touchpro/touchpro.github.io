Sidney's Bonnyconnellan Castle is haunted by a man in a blue uniform who examines the wedding dress displayed on the stair landing.
<p>
However, it's not clear what the castle's ghost is doing these days, since the Shelby County Historical Society reports that the interior has been gutted since 2000.  Have they rebuilt?  Reports indicate that it's in private hands now and is probably in no danger of being demolished anytime soon.  It was built in 1886 by John Loughlin with money made from his Sidney School Furniture Company, and built from granite blocks on his Walnut Street lot.  More than 120 years later, have we seen the last of the Bonnyconnellan's spirits?
