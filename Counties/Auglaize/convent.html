When the church bought the land west of St. Marys, Ohio, for their Convent in 1852, they got it cheap because the land was supposed to be haunted.  When Dr. Maria Friedaburga, administrator of the shrine, died on March 8, 1969, the natural occurrences that followed were seen as signs from Heaven.  When she died, the lights in the chapel went out, then flashed, and a fireball appeared above the shrine.  Though the occurrences were later attributed to a faulty transformer wire, many believe that Dr. Friedaburga's ghost had something to do with it.  If you'd like to see for yourself, you can visit the shrine at SR 119 and 716.
