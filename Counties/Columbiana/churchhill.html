The bridge and the church on this appropriately-named road have separate ghosts.  The church was abandoned for years and was known in the vicinity as the Organ Grinder Church because of the old, broken-down pipe organ that sagged in one corner.  Supposedly if you write someone’s name on the wall of the evil church, something horrible will happen to them.
