The building which houses The Golden Lamb in Lebanon is almost two hundred years old.  A similar log building was built on the site by Jonas Seaman as "a house of public entertainment" and flourished when the county courthouse was built across the street in 1805.  Eventually Jonas was forced to close it to pay his debts, and Ichabod Corwin replaced it with the brick building you can see today in 1815.  It eventually ended up in the hands of Robert and Virginia Jones, who kept the place afloat through the Great Depression by scrounging junk furniture which is today considered extremely valuable.

Many famous historic figures have stayed in the guest rooms at the Golden Lamb, including Charles Dickens, who passed through in 1842 and bitched about how there was nothing good to drink there.  Other famous guests include Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Daniel Webster, DeWitt Clinton, and Lord Stanly, who went on to become Prime Minister of England.

The most famous ghost of the Golden Lamb is Sarah, a little girl.  Sarah's was the nephew of Isaac Stubbs, who managed the inn.  The really weird thing about the little girl ghosts is that Sarah grew up to be an old lady.  So why is her ghost still a little girl?  Maybe it's not really her, but some forgotten guest who died a child.  Some people think she's actually a girl named Eliza Clay (daughter of Henry Clay) who died from a fever at the Golden Lamb in 1825.  At any rate, the hauntings are centered around "Sarah's Room" and began after her stuff was moved into a different room for display.  She likes to knock pictures off the walls and make noise.

Another ghost of the Golden Lamb is that of Charles R. Sherman, Ohio Supreme Court Justice who died at the inn in 1829.  He is described as a "gaunt, gray man" who appears in the hallways from time to time.  His cigar smoke is often smelled, although the Golden Lamb is a no smoking establishment.
