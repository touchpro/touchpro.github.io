The 1890 Opera House is a landmark in McConnelsville, an old canal town located in Morgan County.  It's also haunted.
<P>
Everett, an elderly usher, haunts the Opera House, still wearing his white suit.  A mysterious woman also haunts the building, walking along the catwalks backstage.  
<p>
One of the more recent owners, Galen Finley, told many tales about the ghosts of the Opera House.  He claimed to have been called to work in the middle of the night by police who wanted him to quiet the "party" he had going on in the theater--when, of course, no one was actually there.  Finley even clamed to have watched from the back row while <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> was performed by a cast of ghosts.  Hard to believe, sure, but an interesting story nonetheless.
