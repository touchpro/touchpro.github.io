A wing of the women's jail in Batavia, Ohio, is built over the old potter's field where the indigent were buried--often occupants of the <a href = "ccinfirmary.html">Clermont County Infirmary</a>.  Now that part of the jail is haunted by occupants of the poor folks' graveyard whose bodies were missed during the construction.
