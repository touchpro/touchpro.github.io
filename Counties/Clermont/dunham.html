A haunted house in Amelia is known simply as the Dunham Road House.  Once the centerpiece of a farm in operation before Ohio became a state, today it's simply a big, old house with the address of 2964 Dunham Road.
<p>
The killing which took place there happened in either 1802 or 1803, depending on the version.  It is said that angry Indians, usually Cherokees, emerged from the woods and raided the house, killing the little daughter of the Tracy family, who had settled there to farm land not far from the Ohio River.
<p>
As of this writing (Fall 2005), the house is being renovated, so please don't disturb the guy who's working on it.  Perhaps he'll see the ghost of the little girl so many have seen since she died there 200 years ago.
