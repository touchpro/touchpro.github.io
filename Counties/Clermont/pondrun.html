Pond Run Road near New Richmond is said to be the stomping ground of the Hook Man.  You may have heard the urban legends about Hook Man; Clermont County apparently boasts its very own version.
<p>
The story begins with a couple of very bad parents who kept their disturbed kid chained in the basement.  God, apparently pissed off at their unconventional parenting methods, struck their house with lightning.  The bodies of both parents were found, but all that was found of the boy was his hand.
<p>
Ever since then (the legend goes), the Hook Man has prowled Pond Run Road, which was a popular lovers' lane for years.  Today it's been built up and lacks the places to pull over, but the stories still linger.
