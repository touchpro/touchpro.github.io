Spate House, a two-story brick mansion in Moscow, Clermont County, was built between 1796 and 1798 on the Ohio River.  It housed such notables as the exiled King of France Louis Philippe in 1815, and Marquis de Lafayette in 1825.

With all these interesting residents you'd think that Spate House would have a famous ghost, but it turns out it's haunted by a dog.  The dog's owner was killed in a dispute over a card game, and when it wouldn't be quiet, its owners murderers threw it into the Ohio River in a canvas sack.  Today the house is full of bad vibes and cold spots, and the barking and whining of a dog can be heard in the walls.  Interestingly, <i>Haunted Ohio</i> lists this one as abandoned.
