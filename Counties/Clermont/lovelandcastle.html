The historic Loveland Castle in Loveland is haunted by a king and paige who are attached to an imported throne, and Harry D. Andrews, who built the castle and died when the leaves he was burning out back caught him on fire.  (I'm told it was actually pneumonia that took him, susceptible as he no doubt was with bad burns.)
<p>
An e-mail informant tells me that the haunting details aren't exactly right; it's the rocking chair, she says, which moves on its own--one which belonged to Mr. Andrews.  It's been known to trigger the security motion sensors at night.
