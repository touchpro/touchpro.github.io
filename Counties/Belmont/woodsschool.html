The Woods School just north of Belmont is haunted by a headless horseman who demands saddlebags from travellers.  In 1845 three men disappeared here after selling their horses for large sums of money.  In the 1920s the remains of three saddlebags were found in the woods.

I spent a long evening tearing my car up on the logging roads north of Belmont, looking for the Woods School, only to learn that it's not there anymore.  According to one report I received, it was torn down at the behest of area residents, who were troubled by strange goings-on at the old school.  The photo above shows the hillside where I'm told it once stood.
