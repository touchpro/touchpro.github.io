Woodland Cemetery in Dayton is haunted by the ghost of a good-looking blonde in jeans and tennis shoes.  She sits on a particular gravestone which is famous for glowing with an eerie blue light, especially at night.  This gravestone is very close to the University of Dayton campus.
<p>
Another ghost haunting Woodland Cemetery is that of Johnny Moorehouse, who is buried there with his dog.  He and his dog are said to roam the cemetery after hours, and people often leave candy, toys, or coins for him.

In addition to Johnnu and the good-looking girl , several other inhabitants of the cemetery are said to wander it at night.  This is a story I received from Dayton resident Ruby:

Back in 1984, in August a good friend and I were walking through
Woodland Cemetery.  I was attending college at the time, and didn't 
have
a car.  This was our shortcut to Kroger's.  A prominent Daytonion by 
the
name of Schantz is buried there.  He was a business man and was quite
famous near the end of the 19th century.  We were walking past the
family plot, and we saw a man tending to the grave of Old Man Schantz.
He was dressed in the clothing  of the time, very old-fashioned.  I
didn't think anything of it, because sometimes the local Historical
Society gives tours of the cemetery dressed in period costumes.  He
looked to be about sixtyish.  We both said hello to the gentleman and 
he
just looked at us and smiled.  I wanted to ask him about an upcoming
tour of the place, when suddenly he just faded away.  He was looking at
us the whole time he was "tuning out".  My friend and I took off and 
got
the hell out of there.  None of us ever spoke of the incident again.  
We
also never cut through the cemetery again.

Sounds like a good graveyard to camp out in late at night.
