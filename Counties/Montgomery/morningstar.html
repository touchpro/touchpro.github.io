On Morningstar Road near Germantown, a group of kids out drinking and driving saw a woman on the side of the road, beckoning to them.  They followed, attempting to help her, but she disappeared.
<P>
They later learned that a house had stood where they had seen the woman, and that it had burned down with children inside.  The mother, unable to save her children and insane with grief, ran into the woods, fell, and broke her neck.
<P>
The woman is said to haunt Morningstar Road to this day.
