Dayton's VA Medical Center was built in 1867 to take care of battle-scarred Civil War veterans--many of whom are said to linger in its halls.  Two of its buildings in particular are haunted:  Freedom House and Liberty House.  In Freedom House an 1870s party seems to be going on throughout eternity.  The third floor is especially active, featuring a strange gray mist which moves down the hall.  This may be General Marsena Patrick, who died in the hospital from epilepsy.  In Liberty House, a series of interviews had to be audiotaped since the video equipment wouldn't work inside the building.

You'll find the VA and its rigidly ordered military cemetery along West 3rd Street and Germantown Road.
