The very modern <a href = "http://www.sinclair.edu/">Sinclair Community College</a> is haunted by a myriad of ghosts, all of which stem from the ground the buildings are built on; the old Dayton hanging field was where the cafeteria is today.
<P>
Most of the disturbances occur in Blair Hall.  Coats are tugged; people feel smothering sensations; people hear laughter, voices, dancing, even the meowing of cats.  Elevators show up when no one is there to call them to a floor.  Doors open and close.  The janitorial staff is especially aware of the ghosts.
<P>
The former chief of security at Sinclair made a few appearances around the buildings after he died, too, so if you go, you might run into him.
