A ghost wearing a blue uniform is seen in mirrors at Circleville's Memorial Hall.  Toilets sometimes flush by themselves.  Since Civil War veterans built the Hall in 1890, it's possible that he's one of them.
<p>
The Memorial is where Circleville's accomplished Roundtown Players put on productions all through the year.  According to an actor who contacted me, the ghost there is known as Charlie, and although he appears to be benevolent, he scares animals pretty badly.  One dog nearly went insane after being closed in upstairs.
