Columbus's old Engine House No. 16 in Columbus, located at 260 North Fourth Street, operated as a city ladder company between 1908 and 1981.  Today it houses the <a href = "http://fire.ci.columbus.oh.us/Museum.htm">Central Ohio Fire Museum</a>.

Touring it you can see placards from defunct fire stations, such as old Number Three, as well as photographs from the days of horse-drawn squads, and, most eye-catchingly, shiny classic fire trucks parked side-by-side in the garage bay, all brass railing and oversized spoke wheels and emergency running boards.

It is haunted by the snorting of ghostly horses--presumably those which were once stabled here to pull fire equipment.

Another ghost present at the fire house is that of Captain D--not the crusty sea captain of deep-fried fast food fame, but an old fire captain who used to obsessively check equipment.  (His real name is Captain Dukeman.)  He still continues this practice from beyond the grave.
