<font size = 4>
In presenting this work to the public, representing, as it does, a vast amount of work in research and compilation by the author and his collaborators, the author desires to state that the work is not altogether one of choice.  Rather does he feel it one of duty; to the people of the great Commonwealth of Ohio, the entire Nation and himself.
<p>
Statutory law provides that Ohio's first degree murderers shall die in a prescribed manner.  They are incarcerated in the Penitentiary and their execution falls to the lot of the officials thereof.  These stern but kindly keepers are obliged to perform their sworn duty, however much they might dislike to do so.  That this is not an altogether pleasant duty, seems almost unnecessary to state.
<p>
Beyond the point of the imprisonment of these human beings, most people hear or know but little about them.  They understand in a vague way that they are executed in expiation of their crimes.  But very few, indeed, realize what it means to pass through such a heart-rending and nerve-racking [sic] ordeal.  In this work the author has attempted to place the true facts before all who read, knowing as he does that mere words can never suffice to vividly portray the scenes to your mind as they were enacted in real life.  But a thoughtful reading of this book is certain to be of value to all, if only to show how true the old axiom, "The way of the transgressor is hard."
<p>
As one having to do with the prison's affairs for more than ten years past, having seen and treated with every class of criminals known, the author feels that his experience and knowledge are worthy a hearing and consideration.  And to this end his efforts have been directed towards picturing, in as true-to-life a manner as possible, the incidents connected with the incarceration and execution of Ohio's sixty executed murderers.
<p>
It is hoped that this work will cause its readers to think upon the question of Criminal Execution.  And if the question shall arise in the reader's mind:  "Am I My Brother's Keeper?" the author will feel that his work has accomplished its mission and that his labors have not been in vain
