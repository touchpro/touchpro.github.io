<a href = "http://www.osu.edu">Ohio State</a>, the second-largest campus in the US (screw you, University of Texas), is where I go to school.  Just like any college that's been around since 1870, OSU has a few ghost stories.  Most of these are adapted from the Halloween issue of The Lantern.

Pomerene Hall/Mirror Lake
<dd>
Dr. Clark, a professor in the early part of the century, got depressed about a mining investment and committed suicide.  His body was found where Pomerene Hall now stands.  Mrs. Clark swore never to leave him, and when she died in the 1920's her ghost began to haunt Mirror Lake in a pink dress.  Dr. Clark haunts Pomerene Hall, where he slams doors and does other ineffectual ghostly things.  Mirror Lake and Pomerene Hall are located off of Neil Avenue in the mid-1000's, and are available to visit pretty much all the time.

Hopkins Hall
<dd>
The story with this one goes that a girl was stuck in an elevator all night in Hopkins Hall, which is the art building.  For some reason this caused her to have a mental breakdown, and she wrote things all over the walls of the elevator.  She eventually graduated but was later killed in a car accident, and it is said that people sometimes find notes or scratchings in the Hopkins Hall elevator that say, "I'm still mad at OSU for what they did to me."  Amen.  Hopkins Hall is located on Seventeenth Avenue west of College Road.

Bricker Hall
<dd>
When Herbert Atkinson, a member of the Board of Trustees, died in the 1950's, his ashes were placed in the wall of Bricker Hall behind a plaque.  Since then lights have flashed and the man himself has been seen drinking punch in the lobby.  I have been here--I actually waited for a meeting in front of the plaque--and I didn't see anything.  Oh well.  Bricker Hall is a few buildings west of Hopkins Hall.

Orton Hall
<dd>
The oldest building on campus, Orton Hall is supposed to be haunted by the ghost of its namesake, Edward Orton, the university's first president.  He used to read in the tower, before the trademark bells went in, and it is said that you can still see the flicker of his lamp at night.  He is also reputed to chill the air and make noises in an attempt to make students behave.  But the really weird ghost is that of a prehistoric man with "humped back, thick hair, and a protruding forehead" which is supposed to slam doors, bang on things, and make noises since he can't speak.  Is this the ghost of a football player?  Or does it have something to do with the geological museum in the back of the building?  I had a class in Orton Hall and never experienced anything like this.  It's located on the south side of the Oval.

Drackett Hall
<dd>
According to an e-mail I received, a girl was once haunted by a ghost named Christopher in Drackett Hall on north campus.  This ghost knocked things off shelves and turned appliances on and off and finally revealed himself to the girl and told her his name.  The strange thing about this one is that the ghost followed her from Drackett to her next place and even to her parents' house in Northeast Ohio.  Still, since it started here I think this qualifies as an OSU ghost.

Starling-Loving Hall
<dd>
One of the oldest buildings on campus, Starling-Loving Hall is now home to part of the OSU medical school.  It contains labs, classrooms, and even a morgue.  Ghosts are sighted here frequently, and voices are heard in the halls.

Oxley Hall
<dd>
This, the first women's residence hall, is one of the most distinctive large buildings on campus.  It's used as office space now, but the specter of the days when students lived (and died) there still lingers in the form of a December 17th tradition:  the re-emergent screams of a female student who committed suicide there many decades ago.  She may be present on other days of the year as well, as visitors to the attic have reported seeing, hearing, and feeling strange things.

Canfield Hall
<dd>
This ghost story from the all-girls dorm raises some questions about the possibility of ghosts roaming its halls:
<p>
<font color = "yellow">
When I went to OSU I lived in Canfield Hall.  It really is a pretty sort of gothic building from the outside, and when I lived there in '98 it was one of the oldest buildings with no plans for remodeling.  We lived at the end of the hall on the top floor, and though our room was unusually dark and creepy, I didn't mind it at first.  There was a large mirror across from my bed so if you roll over in the middle of the night awake, you see your face staring back, as well as strange laundry-pile shadows.  All of our friends said the mirror was creepy and some people wouldn't even look at it.  I hung a sheet over my bed canopy-style and I was fine.  As the school year progressed things started happening in the room that were a little odd - my roomate's bible kept being hidden somewhere in the room and she would blame me for it - of course I didn't do it! 
<p>
There was a large pipe that used to be for steam heat that went along the heads of our beds and at night there would be scratching inside of it - we thought it was mice and tolerated it for maybe two hours before I ran down and got the RA, and of course as soon as she stepped in the room it stopped.  This continued for months, and everytime she'd come it would stop.  Then eventually it just stopped on its own.  Well to me all of this wasn't scary, just the weirdness of an old dormitory.  But one night my roomate was out of town and I was up alone in the room.  I was playing on the computer until way late and as I went into the hallway I could tell that all the other girls were asleep because it was dark under their doors.  I left my door open and when I returned from the bathroom I prepared for bed - closing the big heavy curtains and turning the light off.  The room was so small it was the sort of smothering darkness and the curtains dampened the sound so I could tell the distance of all the noises from my bed - the clock ticking, the heater's rumbling.  I remember all of this so well, I was almost falling asleep - the type of tired where you are aware of everything, but your body is absolutely still - when I heard the distinct and unmistakable sound of 3 loud, shuffled footsteps on the carpet stopping at my bed near my face!  I had the canopy, so I couldn't see on the other side (and I'm almost thankful for this).  I laid paralyzed and burning all over because I was so panicked for nearly ten minutes waiting for whatever/whomever to come when I finally burst through the canopy and turned the lights on.  There was nothing there.  The carpet was entirely free of even a pair of socks.  But the sound was unmistakeable; I can still hear it when I remember this story. I explained it to myself that it was a plastic bag shifting in my closet.  Of course in the morning when I checked there was nothing in the closet that could have fallen or was made of plastic.  I wrote it off to my imagination or some blood pumping in one ear. 
<p>
A couple of months later we had some friends come visit from out of town, and one girl needed to change her clothes in my room for privacy.  I left her in the room alone but it took only two minutes before she came out with her face pale and she wouldn't look anyone in the eye.  She just said "I can't go in that room, it's evil."  I was offended, assuming she was talking about how messy it was.  About fifteen minutes later another girl went into the bathroom and came out without going.  She told us, "I saw a ghost in the bathroom!"  She couldn't describe anything about it, only that it was a shadow that passed behind her as she looked in the mirror.  Both girls were entirely freaked out about our hall, and both wouldn't even set foot in my room because of its "presence."  I wrote this off as crazy wiccan-punkgirl stuff and/or snobbery at my messy room.  But definitely there was something sinister about that room - even our phone number spelled out an upside down cross and we would get crazy prank phone calls at all hours of the day!

Alpha Delta Pi
<dd>
This sorority house is one of Columbus's better-known haunts.  It is haunted by the ghosts of a girl who killed herself in the building before the sorority moved in.  Today she is spotted roaming the halls, looking out windows, and in mirrors.  Chandeliers are known to move for no apparent reason.

The Ghost of Jeffrey Dahmer
<dd>
One of the weirder stories to make the rounds at Ohio State is that a particular building is haunted by the ghost of Jeffrey Dahmer, OSU's most famous former student.  Dahmer, known as "The Milwaukee Cannibal," was raised in Bath, Ohio; he later moved to Milwaukee, where he strangled and ate members of that city's gay community.  He was eventually murdered by a fellow inmate just a year into his life sentence.  It's true that Dahmer attended OSU briefly in the early 1980's, but it's exremely hard to determine where he lived while he was here.  Rumors include Lincoln Tower, Morrill Tower, and the above mentioned Drackett Hall, just to name a few.  However, since Dahmer was at OSU for less than one quarter before flunking out and enlisting in the Army, it's doubtful that his ghost would be much interested in hanging around here.
