An Odd Lots (now Big Lots) store in Hilliard was the site of a suicide when it was a Big Bear grocery store.  Now employees report hearing footsteps and feeling cold spots.  Toys and other items are knocked off the shelves with suspicious frequency.  The ghost is even known to pass through people walking down the aisles.
