The Jeffrey Mansion in Bexley (east side of Columbus) is located behind St. Charles and is rented out as a party house sometimes.  Mr. Jeffrey is supposed to have hung himself in the house and willed the grounds to the city of Bexley; today you can sometimes catch a glimpse of him, still hanging in the house.  He's also heard whistling as he walks around his house, which was built in the early 1900s.
