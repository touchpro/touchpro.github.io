Ohio's governors lived in this big house on Columbus's East Broad Street from 1920 to 1957.  Since then it has been a party house, restaurant, hair salon, and headquarters of the Columbus Landmarks Foundation at different times.
<p>
Strange smells fill the Governor's Mansion--described as being like burning hair--and pictures have been known to jump off of walls.  A black woman in a blue dress, a ninteenth century maid, has been seen wandering the halls.  She even spoke to an employee once, telling her that she was happy the building was being renovated instead of standing empty as it had before.  I wonder if she's still there.
