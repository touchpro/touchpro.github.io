The courthouse annex on South High Street in downtown Columbus is supposedly the site of many ghostly occurrences.  Footsteps and laughter are heard by the guards there after the place has been shut down.
<p>
One of the ghosts is that of a man who fell down an elevator shaft when the building was being built.  He plays with the elevators and might be the one responsible for the high number of stuck elevators in the building.
<p>
Another ghost is stuck on the second floor in the Auto Title department, which obviously means he's been condemned to hell.  Yet another makes the Board of Elections offices smell like lilacs for no good reason.
<p>
I had jury duty at the courthouse and passed through the annex many times, but I never saw, heard, or smelled anything out of the ordinary.  Then again, it was so painfully early that I never got more than an hour of sleep the night before.
