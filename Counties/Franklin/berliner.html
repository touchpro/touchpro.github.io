The bike path at Berliner Park may be haunted by the ghosts of suicides and/or drowning victims in the nearby Scioto River.  There is a sharp dropoff at the place where a footbridge once spanned the river.  This is where many of the ghosts seem to like to appear.
<p>
Channel 6 News recently did a story on the ghosts at Berliner Park, featuring regular contributor Philip and his buddy Brent.  Scary stuff.  Head out there at night sometime, if you're brave.
