Built in 1916 as the Kingdom Theater, Grove City's Little Theater Off Broadway is haunted by a girl in a high-necked dress with a brooch.  Her eyes always appear shadowed, which has led people to believe that she is the ghost of Ethel King (Americanized during World War I from Koenig), the blind pianist whose mother built the place.  Loud noises are often heard, and the double doors will sometimes blow open hard, as if blown by a violent wind, when there is no wind blowing.
