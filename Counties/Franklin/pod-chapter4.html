<br>
Josiah Terrill, serial number 18,872, a Meigs County murderer, was hanged September 2, 1887.  He met his fate bravely and, as is said of college graduates, "acquitted himself with great honor."  Like nine-tenths of the men who die upon the gallows, Terrill denied all knowledge of the crime with which he was charged, and with a last breath declared that he suffered death as an innocent man.
<p>
A few hours before the time appointed for his execution, the condemned man awoke from a refreshing sleep and asked for something to eat.  The request, of course, was granted.  Someone unguardedly expressed surprise at the desire to eat, and Terrill said, "You ain't going to choke me off that way are you, without anything to eat?"
<p>
While Terrill was eating, a Missouri Colonel conversed with him, urging him to unburden his mind if he had any guilty knowledge.  The murderer reiterated his oft repeated declaration of innocence, and requested the Warden to give him a drink of whiskey.  But the man's nerve was so great that the Warden declined to give him a stimulant to raise his courage for the trying ordeal.
<p>
After the final administration of spiritual comfort, the Warden read the death warrant, and the condemned man was lead [sic] to the scaffold.
<p>
Terrill was perfectly cool and collected, and his features shone in their natural color.  As he stepped to the trap, Warden Coffin asked him if he had anything to say, to which he replied, "I say I ain't guilty of this here charge."  "You say you are guilty?" queried the Warden who, with others, misunderstood him.  "I say I ain't guilty of this here charge," reiterated Terrill.  "God in heaven knows I ain't guilty.  There are some people and lawyers in Pomeroy who think they have got satisfaction on me now.  That's all I've got to say."
<p>
Warden Coffin then stepped over and shook hands with the condemned man, bidding him good-bye.  The minister gravely followed his example, saying in a solemn tone:  "Josiah, put your confidence and trust in the Lord."  "I have," replied Terrill.
<p>
He was placed over the trap and, standing as if being measured for a suit of clothes, permitted Deputy Cherrington to adjust the ropes.  There was some difficulty in fastening a strap, and he considerately moved his feet to facilitate operations.  The black-cap--a rude bag--was placed over his head and the noose adjusted.  At 12:34 A.M., before the audience realized that it had happened, Warden Coffin shot the lever from north to south.  Rattle went the trap against the sides of the scaffold, and with a boom the body of the condemned man shot down seven feet, oscillated once or twice and then became quiet.  There was not a twitch of the muscles or a movement of the body.
<p>
Instantly there was a plank placed across two chairs on the platform directly under the body of the hanging man, and two doctors sprang upon the plank to take note of the pulse and respiration.  The heart beats were very rapid at first, but after six minutes began to lessen.  In twelve minutes he was dead.  The rope was lowered so the body could be placed on the plank, the knot was cut and the noose loosened, and then the black-cap removed, exposing the swollen and blackened face.  His neck had been broken by the fall, but the rope had not cut the flesh.  The body was placed in a coffin and shipped to Pomeroy, where it was buried by the dead man's mother.
<p>
Strange to say, he expressed no desire to meet the aged woman before his death; on the contrary, he remarked at supper that the only person he cared to see was his child (illegitimate).
<p>
There has always existed grave doubts in the minds of some of Meigs County's best citizens as to Terrill's guilt.  The evidence against him was purely circumstantial, but the jury evidently thought it strong enough to warrant a verdict of guilty.
<p>
He was accused of murdering an old man for whom he had previously worked.  The opinion of the writer is that Josiah Terrill died an innocent man.  This opinion is based upon evidence, and what could be learned from some of Meigs County's best citizens.  Certain it is that he was a poor illiterate man, without money and without influential friends.
<p>
Charles Phillips, the murdered man, was aged and decrepit.  By frugality and hard toil he had accumulated quite a sum of money.  Robbery was the motive of the crime, and a bludgeon and knife were the instruments of destruction.
<p>
Innocent or guilty, Terrill is in the hands of a just God, where he will remain until that great "Day of Judgment," when all wrongs will be righted, and the innocent shown and the guilty punished according to the unerring judgement of an ETERNAL GOD.
