This Westerville elementary school was built in 1931.  It is haunted by a woman in a long coat and high heels, which are heard clicking across the floor when no one is there.  Apparently the milk delivery man came in one morning and saw her standing at the top of the stairs.  He turned around to enter the alarm code, and when he turned back she was gone.  He followed the sound of her receding footsteps but a search of the school building turned up no living occupants.
