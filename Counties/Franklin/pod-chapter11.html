The Terrible End of Elmer Sharkey

Exit Elmer Sharkey and Henry Popp.  The night of December 18, 1890, witnessed the double execution of Elmer Sharkey and Henry Popp.          
<p>
Elmer Sharkey, serial number 20,517, was the picture of physical manhood, young, handsome and accomplished; but his crime was the most diabolical one that ever disgraced the fair pages of Ohio's history.
<p>
About nine o'clock on the fatal night of December 18, Father Logan appeared at the Annex and baptized Sharkey in the Catholic faith.  Shortly after this the two murderers were taken out into the reception room of the Annex, where they remained until after the reading of their death warrants.  It was just a few minutes after eleven o'clock when Father Logan came into the Annex to comfort the condemned men.  He informed t.hem that there was no earthly hope; that the Governor absolutely refused to interfere, and that they should prepare for the worst.  Sharkey and his doomed companion were then taken back into the Annex proper, where they bade good-bye to those who were left behind.  A little later Warden Dyer came down the corridor and entered the reception room, to which the condemned men were again taken.  Facing them the Warden said:  "Boys, I have a painful duty to perform; but the law requires it.  Henry," to Popp "this is your death warrant."  Popp shook as with the ague, and stammered, "Yes sir."  He then arose to his feet and listened attentively to the reading of the warrant.  The reading of Popp's warrant finished, the Warden turned to Sharkey who was leaning against the steam heater and read his warrant.  Sharkey stood with his hands in his pockets, seemingly indifferent.  This over, Chaplain Sutton and Father Logan each offered up a fervent prayer, and then the Warden left the Annex to make further preparations for the executions that followed a few minutes later.
<p>
Promptly at midnight Warden Dyer, Deputy Porter and Assistant Brady at his side, stepped into the guard room.  A mad rush was made for the gate.  But a careful separation of the sheep from the goats was made by the Captain of the guard room, who carefully scrutinized each passport.  Noiselessly the procession passed down the long, dimly-lighted corridor to the Annex.  Once inside the enclosure Warden Dyer promptly mounted the scaffold, and placed everything in readiness.  But a moment thus, and the approach of the doomed man was heralded by appearance of Father Logan who stepped from the cage onto the scaffold, and took his stand on the right of the trap door.  A hush fell as the pale and bloodless countenance of Elmer Sharkey appeared.  He moved with a nervous, gliding motion toward the fatal trap, hesitated for a moment, and then stepped squarely upon it; and with downcast eyes and drooping head, stood there in waiting, a picture of silent despair and hopeless agony.  Once, twice, three times he raised his eyes and cast a quick, sweeping glance over the throng of spectators, then resumed his downward look of misery, murmuring in a low tone:  "My God, make quick work of it!"  When asked if he asked [sic] anything to say, he raised his head slightly and said:  "I ask God's forgiveness, and all I have wronged; and I forgive everything."  The Father pressed the cross to his passive, bloodless lips and he kissed it fervently.  The hood was then made ready and he was asked for his last words.  "That is all I can think of now."
<p>
As the hood was being adjusted he faltered and would have fallen backward in a faint, but was sustained by ready hands.  Just as the noose was being drawn around his neck, he again lost control of himself, and started to fall; but the noose was slipped with a quick movement; the trap sprung, and down he went.  As a result of his fainting he fell in a partially horizontal attitude, and the tightening of the rope produced a swinging motion of the body, thus breaking the force of the fall.  The result was that the neck was not broken, and the poor, wretched matricide was left to die by strangulation.  The sounds that floated out over the awe-hushed group as the dying man struggled for breath, is [sic] beyond description.  The sickening sight and horrible sounds drove many of the spectators from the execution room.
<p>
The drop fell at 12:05, and for several minutes the terrible struggle lasted, then the sounds from the throat, and convulsions of the body grew less frequent.  At 12:34 the quivering heart ceased to beat, just twenty-nine minutes after the drop fell.  All within that narrow enclosure breathed a sigh of relief when the attending physician finally pronounced him dead.
<p>
His execution was one of the longest on record, and the longest in the history of Ohio.
<p>
Elmer Sharkey suffered death on the scaffold for the cold-blooded murder of the woman who gave him birth, a widow of Preble County.  No wonder his death was such an ignominous and horrible one.  Mrs. Sharkey had violently opposed his marriage to the woman of his choice, and threatened to disinherit him if the marriage was consummated.  The unnatural son, in a spirit of revenge, butchered his poor old mother with a meat axe, mangling her almost beyond recognition.  He confessed his guilt, and "died in the hope of a glorious immortality."
