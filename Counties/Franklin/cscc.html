A small school in the northeastern corner of downtown, <a href = "http://www.cscc.edu/">Columbus State Community College</a> is only about thirty years old.  Why is it haunted?  It was built on top of an old Catholic cemetery which was used until the mid-1800's.  Every time they put up a new building they find more bones, which are then sent to a church for consecration and burial, but apparently that's not enough for the ghosts, who remain so pissed that they harass night workers and local cops.  According to a recent article in The Other Paper, some custodians have quit because of the disturbances, and some cops refuse to patrol certain floors alone.

I've known more people than I can count who went to Columbus State, and none of them ever reported anything strange.  One friend of mine was in a play in Nestor Auditorium, where a custodian claimed to have heard his name called, and he rehearsed at night.  Nothing.  But who knows; they say that the disturbances occur more frequently right after they exhume new bodies.  Columbus State is located on Cleveland and Grant Avenues north of downtown.
