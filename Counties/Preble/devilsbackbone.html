A high, crooked gorge along Paint Creek, near Camden along State Route 725, is known as the Devil's Backbone.  It is haunted by the ghosts of Native Americans, whose revered leaders were left along the gorge after death; Indians were forbidden to touch the bones for fear of supernatural retribution.  Miami Indian Chief Red Turtle is said to have cursed the area when he was being driven west from his land by white people.  The reported deaths of a number of settlers in the 1800s were attributed to the ghosts of Indian scouts who are said to prowl the gorge.

It's also notable that this part of Preble County is something of a bigfoot sighting hotspot in Ohio.  Click on the link below to read about an investigation into a few such incidents.
