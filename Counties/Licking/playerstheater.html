The home stage of Newark's local theater troupe is located in a building which used to be the Salvation Army and, after that, was a funeral home for a while.  It's located at 131 West Main Street.
<p>
Like so many theaters, this one is haunted, though the history of the building adds something to the traditional theatrical ghostlore.  The two places where things happen most often are the workshop area and the makeup room, both of which were places where bodies were embalmed and prepped before viewings.
<p>
Support local theater and see the Licking County Players perform a show sometime; maybe you'll catch a glimpse of one of their resident spirits.  For information or tickets call (740) 349-2287.
