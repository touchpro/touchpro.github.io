<a href = "http://www.denison.edu/">Denison University</a> in Granville is one of the oldest colleges in Ohio.  Naturally, it has its share of ghostly tales.  Below are the ones I've come across.

Library
<dd>
The seventh floor of the library, which is not open to the public without a special pass, is haunted by the ghost of a librarian who will jostle you awake if you fall asleep up there.

Chamberlin Lodge
<dd>
This dorm building used to be a frat house.  A report I received tells of a door which mysteriously opened on its own, invisible hands on a resident's shoulder, and a sudden drop in temperature.  You can read it <a href = "../../Encounters/denisonstory.html">here</a>.  The story also notes that there is a gravestone with the name Chamberlin on it in the Granville Cemetery, but this might just be a coincidence.
