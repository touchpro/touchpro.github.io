Weird stories are told about a cemetery in this small town in western Licking County--not necessarily the village cemetery, but name unknown.  One of the original families from this area is buried here--last name Devilbliss or maybe Devilish, depending on the version you hear.  They were famous as coldblooded Indian killers who practiced weird, Satanic rituals in the woods.  They used Indians, who could be killed without much consequence, as human sacrifices.
<p>
Now their grave is a weird spot in the cemetery near the school; supposedly the Devilbliss clan is buried in the opposite direction from the rest of the cemetery's inhabitants.
