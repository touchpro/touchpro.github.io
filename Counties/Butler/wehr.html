The old cemetery on Wehr Road in Trenton is said to be haunted by the ghost of a caretaker who was murdered by a hatchet-wielding maniac.  For some reason he now carries the hatchet, and will chase you away if you approach the cemetery at night.  If you drive by at night you might hear the sound of the hatchet hitting the side of the mausoleum, which is apparently what the caretaker does to pass the time when there are no kids to chase away.  Hatchet marks can be seen in the mausoleum wall.
