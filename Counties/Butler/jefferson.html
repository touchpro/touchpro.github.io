Jefferson Elementary in Middletown is said to have been built atop a burial ground of some sort, and as a consequence has numerous ghosts.  Employees sometimes hear the sounds of phantom children playing in the gymnasium, or see a ghostly little girl roaming the halls.

This information must all be read in the past tense, however, as Jefferson ES was finally demolished in July of 2003.  Perhaps the spot it occupied is still haunted in some fashion.  The photos you see on this page were contributed by a generous contributor who wishes to remain nameless.

The following story was sent to me by a former student:
<p>
<font color = "yellow">
I attended Jefferson Elementary School as a child from 1963 until 1969.  The gymnasium is separated from the main part of the building by a glass walkway.  On many occasions, while walking through this walkway on my way to gym class, I could hear the sounds of kids yelling and laughing, and balls bouncing on the floor.  Thinking I was early or the previous class was running late, I would open the double doors to the gym, only to find it empty.  I never thought much of it at the time, being so young.  And later I just forgot about it, going on to other schools as I got older.  But when I read the stories about the same thing happening to other people and the belief that the school was built over an old graveyard, I remembered the strange things that happened to me.
