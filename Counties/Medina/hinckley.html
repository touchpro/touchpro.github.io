The library in the town of Hinckley is built into a small white clapboard house which dates from the 1840's.  The sister of Dr. Nelson Wilcox, a "walking encyclopedia" who owned a log cabin on the property before the house was built, haunts the building.  She died tragically young and is still sighted in her period dress from time to time.
