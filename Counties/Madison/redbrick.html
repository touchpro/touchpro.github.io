The little town of Lafayette in Madison County is home to one of the oldest continuously operating taverns in the United States:  the Red Brick Tavern.  Lafayette itself is similar to many towns whose growth was spurred by the construction of the National Road.  The Red Brick Tavern opened its doors just before the Road was completed, in 1837.  A Mr. Watson and his wife owned the place and operated it as an inn, tavern, restaurant, stagecoach stop, and mail relay station for years.  The first cookstove in Madison County was located in its kitchen; a lot of people at that time thought it was an invention of the devil because it kept women from doing "an honest day's work."
<p>
When the railroads came along there was no longer a demand for inns or mail stations on the highway, so the Red Brick became a restaurant only.  Over the years no less than six presidents dined here:  John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Warren G. Harding.
<p>
In the 1950s there was a bright neon sign out front, and later there was the trademark white fence surrounding the property.  Today the Red Brick is still operating and serving very good food in the original dining room to anyone willing to make the drive.
<p>
And it is also said to be haunted.  Footsteps are heard in the upper floors, where the inn rooms used to be.  I'm planning a trip to the Red Brick, so watch for photos and details to be added to this page soon.
