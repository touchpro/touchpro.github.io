A screaming ghost named Mimi is supposed to haunt a bridge in rural Seneca County.  Park your car on it and flash your headlights and she'll come after you.  She is angry, they say, because she was forced by society to kill her out-of-wedlock baby by throwing it over the edge; the grief drove her insane.  The bridge itself is located on one of the side roads off County Road 15, near Old Fort.
