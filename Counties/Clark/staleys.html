Old Man Staley's mansion and mill stand on this road near New Carlisle.  According to local legend, Staley went crazy and murdered a lot of people:  his family, his servants, himself.  Now Old Man Staley stalks up and down the road near his home and occasionally plays havoc with passing cars' electrical systems.
