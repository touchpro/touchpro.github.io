At least one of the mines is across from most of the foundations.  Two concrete shafts slope downward, disappearing into the ground.  The big wooden structure above once surrounded these entrances.  I've heard it theorized that one shaft was the ventilation and the other was for the miners.

The mine shafts are bricked up, and I've heard that they're probably flooded as well.  Mines are supposed to be the most dangerous abandoned things to explore, but I did want to try to get down there until I heard about the flooding.

Near the mine shafts is the pumpstation--a small brick building which used to cover a well.  If there was ever a fire in the mines (as there was during the strike), water could be pumped up from the well and used to put it out.  Today the pumpstation is still standing, complete except for the well and the roof.
