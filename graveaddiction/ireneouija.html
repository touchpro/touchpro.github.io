On July 15, 2006 I received an e-mail from Irene about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So when you think of a cool board game to play you think of an ouija board. Well, it is entertaining but you should consider the risks.
<br><br>
They say when you welcome it home it there to stay.
<br><br>
My name is Irene, and about 9 years ago at age 12 I was invited to my friend's birthday party. Well, the party was getting lame and someone suggested that we play a game (by the way, her name is Olivia).  She said, &quot;My brother has an ouija board.&quot; So to make matters worse, I opened my big mouth and said &quot;Let's light up a candle and turn off all the lights&quot;...mind you, I wasn't part of the circle, I was just watching them play. They all started giggling and started asking questions like &quot;Is there anyone who wants to talk?&quot;
<br><br>
The board didn't do anything at first...then the planchette moved towards the letter y. Then towards the letter n.
<br><br>
So then they asked it what that meant.
<br><br>
The board didn't do anything for like 3-4 minutes. So everyone started getting bored, and I told them to put it away. When I reached for the planchette it moved.  I jumped back in disbelief. It freaking moved! So then everyone was like do it, Irene....you do it to make it talk to you. Well, I was scared but I was so damn curious. I placed my hand on the planchette and it moved towards the letter n. Then it spelled t-a-l-k. So we put it together...no talk...so I asked then what?
<br><br>
The damn candle went out and Olivia started screaming.  It was pitch black and we didn't know where in the room she was.  It sounded like she was everywhere, kind of like echos and  high pitched screaming. Well, we got to the light switch, and there in the corner of the room was poor Olivia.  She looked like she had seen a ghost.  She was pale and she had bruises all over her arms and neck.  And she was in shock...weeks later we went over to see how she was doing.  She said everything was fine and her mom burned the evil thing. She also mentioned that weird stuff went on in the house, especially at night. Well, I stayed the night and she was right...you can hear howling and cries coming from the water pipes in her bathroom. And the damn light kept turning off and on. Well, I told Olivia that when you welcome a spirit in, who knows when it's going to decide to leave.  Creepy yes...true...hell yeah. Man. Good thing she moved. I hate that crap, but I'm still curious...
