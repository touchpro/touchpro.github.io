On December 2, 2005 I received an e-mail from Bonnee about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I changed the names in this occurrence for my friend's sake. Well, my friend Lara and I had been craving to get an ouija board for who knows how long, since like 8th grade! Anyway, she got one two months ago. We immediately asked around to see who wanted to attend the session. It was only us and two others (Espy, which is short for Esperanza, and Jane). We didn't want to go to through with it in our houses, so we went to the neighborhood park. This was our conversation:
<br><br>
Lara: How do we start this thing?<br>
<i>I know this word for word because of the tape recorder I brought along.</i><br>
Jane: Try using a, um, prayer to protect us.<br>
Lara: Okay<br>
<i>We said 'Our Father' and 'Hail Mary'...the only prayers we could think of, we were a little shaky!</i><br>
Me: Is, um, anyone here that would like to talk to us?<br>
Board: <i>no movement</i><br>
<br>
Espy: Hello? This is not a twisted game we are playing, we really are serious!!!<br>
Me: Es, not the time!!<br>
Jane: Oh shut up already, whoever might be on the other end is most likely laughing their butt off or scared to death! Oh scratch, that scared a lot!<br>
Larny: This is not a game J., stop it!<br>
Me: Anyway, is there anyone who would like to have a chit chat with us? We apologize for this rude behavior.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
<i>We looked like it was pointing a gun at us!</i><br>
<br>
Larny: Would you like to speak to a certain person, or are you just here for kicks?<br>
Board: Jane<br>
<br>
<i>At this, I think I saw Jane get paler</i><br>
<br>
Jane: What would you like to say?<br>
Board: Dad<br>
<br>
Jane: What??<br>
<i>Jane's father had died three years ago when he was late to pick her up after school and got into an accident. She blames herself still.</i><br>
Board: Hi sweetie<br>
<br>
Jane: Daddy?<br>
Board: Yes hi applecake <i>J told us later that his nickname for her was Applecake</i><br>
<br>
Jane: <i>crying</i> Daddy, are you safe where you are? Are they hurting you? Do you need help?<br>
Board: Sweetheart, calm down. I am fine. No not hurt and no don't need help. <i>he misspells words a lot</i><br>
<br>
Espy: Mr. K? Is that really you?!?!<br>
Board: Oh it is my favorite pumpkin<br>
<i>In the Thanksgiving play in 4th grade, Espy was a pumpkin for some reason!</i><br>
Board: I have to go. J J no blame. Accident. Love you.<br>
<br>
Jane: <i>screamed</i> Daddy, no! Don't go, I want you to answer some quetions!!<br>
Board: <i>no movement</i><br>
<br>
Lara: It is okay J, we are here for you. Do want to call it a night?<br>
Jane: No, no never! I want to keep going, this will be interesting.<br>
Espy: Whatever. Are there any other spirits that would like to make your presence known?<br>
Me: Wow Es, that was deep!<br>
Espy: Oh shut up. LOOK!!<br>
Board: <i>Spinning around and around. I didn't know what to do, so I picked up the planchette.</i><br>
Lara: Put it down. We have more to finish.<br>
Me: Fine.<br>
<br>
<i>After many fruitless attempts, we got nothing until....</i>
<br><br>
Board: Lara<br>
<br>
Lara: Yes, can I help you?<br>
Board: Be Ghrwega<br>
<br>
Me: Can you try that again?<br>
Board: Be careful<br>
<br>
Me: She has to be careful of what?<br>
Board: Me<br>
<br>
Lara: Okay, well then...GOODBYE!!!<br>
<br>
Needless to say we freaked out! Even though it was a Wednesday, we spent the night at Lara's house to keep her safe. Nothing has happened, except some other spooky encounters which I will gladly submit later!
