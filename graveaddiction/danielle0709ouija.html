On July 6, 2009 I received an e-mail from Danielle about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I had never used the Ouija Board before, and my friend told me she had an old one.  So after school one day we decided to use it.  I thought it was pretty cool and pretty harmless, so I asked her if I could borrow it.  Later that day, another friend of mine came over and we were using it ouside and everything seemed alright.  But later that night when we decided to use it in my house, it was a bit different.  We sat in my living room and began to use it.  I asked if a spirit was there and it went to &quot;yes.&quot;  I then asked if it was good, and it went to &quot;no.&quot;  I was getting a little bit freaked out, so I asked it if it was evil, and it went to &quot;yes.&quot;  By that point I started to cry, because I knew very bad things could happen by using the board.  But I still kept asking questions.
<br><br>
I asked where the spirit was; if it was next to my friend, and it went to &quot;no.&quot;  Then I asked if it was near me, and it went to &quot;no&quot; again.  I then asked where it was, and it spelled out &quot;Up.&quot;  I asked for it's name, and it looked like it was headed towards Q, but then it went to other letters that were very random.  My friend pointed out that it was going in a circle.  I paid closer attention to it, and it kept going back and forth at differet points.  I then realized that it was making the shape of a pentagram so I took my hand off of it.  I told my friend and she had no idea what that was so I explained.  I just wanted to ask two more questions before saying goodbye.  I asked if it was a boy or a girl and it said girl, so then I asked how old they were when they died and it went to 5.
<br><br>
I thought a little girl couldn't be evil.  I asked it if it was lying, and it said &quot;no.&quot; Then it started to go in a circle again.  I quickly said goodbye, but it stopped moving. I said goodbye at least two more times, the last very annoyed and nothing moved.  But right after I said that my friend and I, even my dog, heard a high pitched little girl laughing shrilly and evil-like, almost screeching.  It came from the direction of my room, but up near the attic.  I texted the friend who let me borrow the board and told her about it, but she didn't believe me.
<br><br>
Thinking it was okay to use the board again, my friend and I started over.  We asked if a spirit was there, and if it was good, and it said &quot;yes.&quot;  So then I asked if it knew the other spirit that was there earlier, and it said &quot;yes.&quot;  I then asked the spirit's name, and it went to Q again.  I was a little confused, so I cut it off and asked if it was a girl or boy.  It went to girl, I asked it's age and it went to 5.  I asked if it was the same spirit that was there before, and it said &quot;yes.&quot;  I asked if it wanted to hurt me, and it said "&quot;yes.&quot;
<br><br>
Remembering something I had seen somewhere, I wondered if there were six spirits there, and asked how many spirits were there.  It went to 6.  Then it started to go in a circle again, so I stopped it.  I asked if it knew who Azazel was, and it said &quot;yes.&quot;  I asked if he was there, and it said &quot;no.&quot;  I then asked it if it was what made the noises I usually hear in my room, and it said &quot;yes&quot;. I was freaking out, so I said goodbye about twelve times with nothing happening.  My friend then asked, &quot;Do you want to leave?&quot;  It went, very quickly, over to &quot;no.&quot;
<br><br>
I was done, so I got up and walked into my room.  I noticed that things I had firmly tacked into my wall were now all on my floor.  I didn't want to think about trying to go to sleep that night.  But when I was going to sleep, I went out very quickly.  I don't really recall what I dreamt about, but I remember being half conscious, because I remember what I was doing.  I was laying on my back with my knees bent up and my arms spread out, going from each end of my bed.  Next, I remember slowly clawing at my throat and chest, and then I began choking.  I gained a bit more consciousness and began clawing at my chest very fast.  Then I quickly sat up in my bed, heaving.  It took me a minute to register what had just happened, and while sitting there in my room, I noticed my face was wet.  I had been crying in my sleep and I didn't know why.  Also, it was incredibly hot in my room.  I looked over at my clock and it said 3:00 AM exactly.  I knew that was dead-time.  It took me a long time to fall back asleep.
<br><br>
The next morning my friend who loaned me the board, and who's bedroom is right under mine, told me she didn't believe what I had texted her earlier.  But while she was sleeping last night, she heard a little girl say her name, which woke her up.  She too was crying.  And then her dog began to bark like crazy.   I recalled my dog barking franticly too at the same time.  I went to school and told the friend who used the board with me, and she told me she felt like she was being watched at her house.  One of my friends at school told me I should pray and put crosses up, but I really didn't want to.  Nothing happened for a few nights.  Then one night, while getting ready for bed, I was in my bathroom.  For the heck of it, I wanted to see if I still remembered the &quot;Our Father&quot; and began to say it.  I kept messing up at the last line and forgetting what it said, so I said Amen.  Right when I did that, outside of the bathroom door, I heard the oddest growl like sound that sounded vicious and high-pitched.  I first thought my dog, but she was in my parents room and didn't have a growl that high.
<br><br>
So far that's all that has happened to me, but I still feel as though I have to keep looking over my shoulders from time to time.
