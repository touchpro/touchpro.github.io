On October 23, 2006 I received an e-mail from Rachel about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Rachel, and I have had an experience with an ouija board (on August 23, 2002) that I will always remember!
<br><br>
One night myself (Rachel), my two sisters (Kristy and Chelsea), and my 3 friends (Trisha, Sara, and Vanessa) all stayed the night.  Trisha brought over the ouija board. None of us had played the ouija board before, and we all wanted to try.  We got the same number of candles to match how many people were there that night.  We all sat in the middle of my living room floor and started to play. Kristy and Trisha were the ones with their hands on the planchette.
<br><br>
Trisha: Is there anyone here with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Trisha: What's your name?<br>
Board: Jack<br>
<br>
Trisha: How did you die?<br>
Board: Gun<br>
<br>
Trisha: When did you die?<br>
Board: 1954<br>
<br>
Trisha: Did someone kill you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Trisha: Did you kill yourself?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Trisha: Why?<br>
Board: azbycx<br>
<br>
Trisha: What's that mean?<br>
Board: Love<br>
<br>
Trisha: You love someone?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Trisha: Who?<br>
Board: Rachel<br>
<br>
At this point we thought that Kristy and Trisha were moving the planchette, but they claimed they weren't. We couldn't be sure so we decided to blindfold them. Then I (Rachel) began to ask questions...<br>
<br>
Rachel: Why do you love me?<br>
Board: I always have<br>
<br>
Rachel: Do I know you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Rachel: Then how can you love me?<br>
Board: watching you<br>
<br>
Rachel: You watch me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Since we were getting freaked out, we decided to ask questions that no one could possibly know about us...not even each other.<br><br>
Rachel: Where is my birthmark?<br>
Board: Head<br>
<br>
Rachel: What kind?<br>
Board: Strawberry<br>
<br>
Rachel: How did you know I have a strawberry birthmark?<br>
Board: I know<br>
<br>
Rachel: You know I have a boyfriend, right?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
At that point the planchette was flying so fast around the board that it slipped out from under Kristy and Trisha's fingers...we all decided that we wanted to know who was going to die first out of all of us.<br>
<br>
Rachel: Do you know who is going to die first out of us?<br>
Board: Sara<br>
<br>
Rachel: How?<br>
Board: Car accident<br>
<br>
Rachel: With another person?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: Who?<br>
Board: Katie<br>
<br>
Rachel: Her sister??<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We all started freaking out, and Aara wanted to know when...keep in mind that Trisha and Kristy had blindfolds on...<br>
<br>
Rachel: Sara wants to know when.<br>
Board: 22<br>
<br>
Rachel: When she's 22?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: Why is her sister going to kill her?<br>
Board: Jealous<br>
<br>
Sara's sister is very jealous of her, and we all knew that so we got scared...none of us wanted to know who was next to die so we dropped the subject. The planchette started flying all over the board and slipped out from under their fingers again. We all freaked out!<br>
<br>
Board: No phone<br>
<br>
Board: No phone<br>
<br>
As the board kept spelling that out, the phone rang...and it was my (Rachel's) boyfriend Rick...<br>
<br>
Board: Kill kill him<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Kill who?<br>
Board: Rick<br>
<br>
Vanessa: How do you know him?<br>
Board: Rachel<br>
<br>
Vanessa: What about her?<br>
Board: Rachel loves Rick<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Yea, so?<br>
Board: He must die<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Is Rachel going to marry Rick?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Who is?<br>
Board: Sara<br>
<br>
Vanessa: What?<br>
Board: Sara (as the planchette flew off the board)<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Are you a mean spirit?<br>
board: No<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Then why are you being violent?<br>
Board: I love her<br>
<br>
Board: No phone I said no phone<br>
<br>
So I threw the phone...we didn't know how he knew or how to explain it.<br>
<br>
Board: Blood<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Blood?<br>
Board: Yes 3<br>
<br>
Vanessa: 3 what?<br>
Board: People<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vanessa: We are going to bleed?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We decided to take a bathroom break and come back...we just left the board.  Vanessa, me, and Sara all went to the bathroom, and to our suprise we all three got our periods.  We were freaking out, and I started to cry.<br>
<br>
Rachel: How did you know that?<br>
Board: I'm sorry<br>
<br>
Rachel: About what?<br>
Board: Crying<br>
<br>
Rachel: You're scaring me<br>
Board: I'm sorry<br>
<br>
Rachel: If you're sorry stop scaring me!<br>
Board: Don't cry I love you<br>
<br>
Rachel: I know...<br>
Board: Don't cry<br>
<br>
Rachel: Are you going to haunt me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Rachel: Promise?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
I had stopped crying and the phone rang again, but we picked up.  It was Rick, and we told him what happened.  He didn't believe us so we told him to come over.  He came over and this is what happened...<br>
<br>
Rachel: Rick's here.<br>
Board: Fuck Fuck Fuck<br>
<br>
Rachel: Fuck what?<br>
Board: Him<br>
<br>
Rachel: What do you mean?<br>
Board: Rick LEAVE<br>
<br>
Rachel: But I love him. Why does he have to leave?<br>
Board: I'll hurt him<br>
<br>
Rachel: Don't hurt him!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: He's not leaving.<br>
Board: azbycx<br>
<br>
Rachel: What's that mean?<br>
Board: I hate<br>
<br>
Rachel: Who?<br>
Board: Rick<br>
<br>
Rachel: Why?<br>
Board: He loves you<br>
<br>
Rachel: He does?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: How do you know?<br>
Board: I know<br>
<br>
Rachel: Okay, well are you still going to hurt him?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: Why, he is good to me.<br>
Board: I know<br>
<br>
Rachel: Then why do you want to hurt him if he is good to me?<br>
Board: Because<br>
<br>
Rachel:  Because why?<br>
Board: I said so<br>
<br>
Rachel: Well don't...if he loves me and you love me then you have something in common, correct?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Rachel: Then don't hurt him.<br>
Board: I won't<br>
<br>
Rachel: Thank you.<br>
Board: I love you<br>
<br>
We decided to switch people on the planchette, and it was now Vanessa and Chelsea.  Trisha was talking now.<br>
<br>
Trisha: Is anything going to happen to us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Trisha: What is going to happen?<br>
Board: Death<br>
<br>
Trisha: Who's going to die?<br>
Board: Everyone<br>
<br>
Trisha: All of us?<br>
Board: Except my love<br>
<br>
Trisha: Except Rachel?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Trisha: Why do we have to die?<br>
Board: I hate you<br>
<br>
Trisha: We are going to say goodbye.<br>
Board: Wait...<br>
<br>
Trisha: What???<br>
Board: I love you Rachel<br>
<br>
Trisha: Goodbye<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
We have used the board since then, and Jack is still on there.  He is haunting the board.  And every time he says I love you...and says he is watching me...I always feel like someone really is watching me now.
