On May 26, 2006 I received an e-mail from Kelly Lynch about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I've been a browser of your website for a while now and I asked my Dad if I could tell you about a story that happened to him when he was my age (17 years young - Dad is now 53).
<br><br>
Dad (back then known as Scabber by his friends), Boner, Craze, and Georgie had read all about Ouija boards and wanted to try it out. Since they didn't have enough money to purchase one, Craze decided to make one by getting a spare piece of lumber, cutting it, and painting the symbols, letters, and numbers on it.
<br><br>
They decided one night to test it, and they asked all the regular, silly questions that people normally ask. &quot;Who likes me?&quot;, "&quot;When will I die?&quot;, such and such. My Dad decided to test to see what he could do to invoke the spirits. This is what happened.
<br><br>
Scabber: Is there anyone out there who'd like to talk to us?<br>
Board: YES.<br>
<br>
Boner: What is your name?<br>
Board: SAM. *does the infinity symbol across the board*<br>
<br>
Craze: Where are you from, Sam?<br>
Board: *Doesn't answer for a few moments* KNOWLEDGE.<br>
<br>
Craze: Would you like to try again?<br>
Board: TREE.<br>
<br>
Scabber: Tree of Knowledge?<br>
Board: YES. *does the infinity symbol again*<br>
<br>
Georgie: Are you The Devil, Sam?<br>
Board: I GO BY MANY NAMES.<br>
<br>
Naturally, all the boys are freaked out, but my Dad wanted to continue on with the session.
<br><br>
Scabber: Sam, where do you reside now?<br>
Board: EARTH.<br>
<br>
Georgie: What do you mean?<br>
Board: NO HELL.<br>
<br>
Georgie: Could you please explain more?<br>
Board: NO HEAVEN.<br>
<br>
Craze: Please go on.<br>
Board: BOTH ON EARTH.<br>
<br>
Boner: Are you saying Heaven and Hell don't exist because we already deal with them in our lives?<br>
Board: YES.<br>
<br>
Scabber: Is there a God?<br>
Board: *No answer*<br>
<br>
Scabber: Did Jesus Christ really exist?<br>
Board: *points to the moon and keeps pointing to the number 6*<br>
<br>
Scabber: Is Jesus Christ the son of God and our Lord and Saviour?<br>
<br>
My Dad says it happened in just a few seconds, but the board lifted an inch or two off the ground and threw itself against a wall.  All the boys ran for it and have never touched a Ouija board since. I'm not allowed to play one at home or bring one into the house.
