On December 13, 2008 I received an e-mail from Hume about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It was December 13, Saturday, about 7 o'clock when we used the ouija for the second time.  The first time we didn't get much of a response. We are Hume (12, me) and my best friend Arianna (13). We did it in her backyard after we cast a magick circle with a mixture of table and sea salt, along with a ring of white candles. We noticed it got considerably colder inside the circle, to the point we could see our breath, but outside we couldn't (but it was December, after all). I made a clay planchette, but we decided it would be easier if we used a light one (a folded piece of paper).
<br><br>
Hume: Are there any entities here that wish to communicate with us?<br>
Board: -slight response- (with planchette)<br>
Arianna:  I think it's too heavy, wanna use the paper?<br>
Hume: Good idea<br>
Hume: Are there any entities here that wish t-<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Hume: Holy @#!% it's moving!<br>
Arianna: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA And I felt that HAHAHA<br>
Hume: SHHHH, calm down.<br>
<br>
(we take a few moments to calm down)<br>
<br>
Hume: Why were you laughing?<br>
Arianna: Cuz you were cursing<br>
Hume: I apologize to anything out there that may have been offended in any way.<br>
Hume: What are you?<br>
<br>
(realizes Arianna can't reach the end of the board)<br>
<br>
Hume: Move closer.<br>
Arianna: Why?<br>
Hume: You're too far away.<br>
Arianna: Oh ya<br>
-moves closer-<br>
-takes off shoes-<br>
Hume: What the?<br>
Arianna: I'm wearing extra socks.<br>
Hume: Whatever,<br>
Hume: What are you?<br>
Board: JQUG<br>
Hume: Wanna try and spell that again?<br>
Board: -no response-<br>
Arianna: What did it say?   JQU, at least it got the QU right.<br>
Hume: What?<br>
Arianna: Nothing.<br>
Hume: Let's try again with a simpler question.  What is your name?<br>
Board: D<br>
Arianna: God, that scared me.  Did you hear that?<br>
Hume: Crap, you took your hands off it.  Now that's a problem.<br>
Arianna: I know, but it really scared the crap out of me.<br>
Hume: Hands back on it.<br>
Hume: So, D. The first letter is D. What is your name?<br>
Arianna: I hear something talking, I'm serious.<br>
Hume: (whispers something we couldn't hear on the tape, and I forgot)<br>
Arianna: Oh, God please!<br>
Hume: Stop it!<br>
Arianna: But I hear voices!<br>
Hume: What is it saying?<br>
Arianna: I don't know! Please!<br>
Hume: Show your pupils (looks into her eyes with a flashlight).<br>
Arianna: What?<br>
Hume: Ok, you're not on drugs.<br>
Arianna: Hey! (hits me)<br>
Hume: Ow!<br>
Hume: Are you hearing like-<br>
Arianna: Yes, I hear it. I thought it was dad at first, but it's not.<br>
<br>
(her dad was inside watching tv)<br>
<br>
Hume: What did it say?<br>
Arianna: I don't know!<br>
Arianna: It has started making noise, like aaaa haaaa haaaaaa.<br>
Hume: Thats me, I'm like -huff- -huff- (I was congested and had a sore throat, so I was constantly making a huffing sound which irritataed the crap out of EVERYONE)<br>
Arianna: No, not like that.  No, it didn't sound like that -whine-<br>
Hume: We're talking to invisible things you might be-<br>
Arianna: -points behind Hume-<br>
Hume: -freaks out, thinking she saw something-<br>
Hume: -exhales- Don't do that.<br>
Hume: As I was saying, you might be exceptionally aware of the paranormal.<br>
Arianna: Oh noooooooooo!<br>
Hume: It's not a bad thing.<br>
Arianna: I know, but it's freaking me out.  The lights are off! (Arianna says she's not normally afraid of the dark, &quot;She has very high courage&quot;)<br>
Hume: Ok, let's continue.  Apologies to anything that might have been offended AGAIN.<br>
Arianna: I heard it.<br>
Arianna: That's what I told you the first time.<br>
Hume: IF YOU CONTINUE DOING THIS WE COULD PISS IT OFF AND MAKE IT WANT TO KILL US! (not shouting, just talking really fast)<br>
Arianna: I know, we're still in the circle.<br>
Hume: But the dogs aren't...<br>
Arianna: ...<br>
Hume: I apologize for the interruption, may we ask the question again...what is your name?<br>
Board: DRE<br>
Arianna: Maybe it's Derek.<br>
Hume: I know, I was thinking the same thing.<br>
Arianna: I think I know where it's going again.<br>
Hume: Doesn't matter.<br>
Arianna: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!<br>
Arianna: I'm not - I'm barely doing anything.<br>
Board: NO<br>
Hume: Your name is not Dre?<br>
Arianna: -Duh-<br>
Hume: Does your name start with Dre?<br>
Board: -no movement-<br>
Arianna: I bet I scared it when I said that I heard it.<br>
Hume: It's not scaring it, it's like a ghost.  It's not like...<br>
Arianna: But it really scared me, it wasn't you.<br>
Hume: We've probably figured that out by now.<br>
Arianna: But it was like...it didn't sound like your voice. (church bells ringing the hour in the distance)<br>
Hume: Are you really freaked out about this?<br>
Arianna: The hearing voices? Yes!<br>
Hume: Do you want us to try and do something about it?<br>
Arianna: No, it's fine.  It's stopped now, it just freaked me out because like I didn't think I'd hear it.<br>
Hume: OK, can we try this again please?<br>
Arianna: Yes<br>
Hume: Is your name Derek?<br>
Board: 0<br>
Hume: It went to like 0, but zero is close to yes.<br>
Arianna: But it's not yes.<br>
Hume: ...<br>
Hume: Are you having trouble communicating with us?<br>
Board: -wiggles-<br>
Hume: Goodbye.  Say goodbye.<br>
Arianna: Goodbye<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
DOGS START FREAKING OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
We...well, SHE calms them down and we try again for one last question.<br>
Hume: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: -No response-<br>
Hume: Are there any entities that wish to communicate with us?<br>
Board: -No response-<br>
Hume: Now we have a good reason to think that it has left our presence.<br>
<br>
-Terminates Communication-<br>
<br>
Now that I look back on it, I was SO stupid while I was doing this...0 doesn't mean no.
