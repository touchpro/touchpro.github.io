On August 17, 2008 I received an e-mail from Nick Allen about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Nick, and my friends an I have just been introduced to the ouija board.  We use the board every time that we are at my friend Dustin's house, and we have no problem contacting a spirit because his house is close to a graveyard.  My friend Tyler Kadle has a story on the website titled &quot;Loaded with Spirits,&quot;  which was just our first night only using the ouija board.  Since we have been using the ouija board, we have encountered some weird stuff and I am questioning the real meaning of a spirit that is from the Moon.  I know that every person has a spirit guide, but I did not know that a spirit guide could be from the moon.  So far two of the maybe 10 people who we have used the board with have spirit guides that are from the moon.  At first Tyler and I would not even talk to the spirits from the moon, but we have started talking to them.  My best friend's sister's spirit guide is from the moon, but is very strong too so we talk to him the most.  He seems nice, and he actually lets us talk to other spirits.  I was just wondering if this is a spirit messing with us, or if it is possible to have a spirit guide from the moon.
<br><br>
We have also had close calls with really bad spirits.  My spirit guide and Katie's spirit guide have both slowed down to a halt, almost stopped.  We knew that something was up, and after asking some questions we found out that they were protecting us from bad spirits.  But even though they do that, it seems that silver hurts all kinds of spirits.  I use silver from now on because of what happened the first night where something came over me.  I could only explain it as a surge of energy through my whole body that just made me cringe up.  That whole night I sweated like it was 100 degrees F.  My dreams were only of using the Ouija board. I remember that night we didn't close the board properly because it was our first time, but we have fixed our mistake.  I believe that something tried to take me over or drag me into another world for a bit, but the silver that was on my wrist saved me.  The surge came back a second time, right after the first surge, but lasted only 1/5 of the last time.  That is why I use silver from now on, but while talking to my spirit guide, Lament Tregs, that silver hurt him as well.  So is it true that silver hurts both the good and bad spirits?

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Nick, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to him.
