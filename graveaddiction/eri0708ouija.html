On July 18, 2008 I received an e-mail from Eri M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Earlier today my friend, Laura, and I went outside to use a ouija board. We ended up sitting outside in a park behind a library.  I was talking to my spiritual guardian, George, who I usually always talk to on the board.  The last time I used the board, George told me I was being followed by an evil spirit. I said a prayer and George told me I should be fine. That was almost a month ago.
<br><br>
Laura and I were sitting on a bench when we started talking to spirits other than George.  We met this spirit named JM, which stood for Jack.  We asked if he was a bad spirit, and he said yes.  From your website, I got the idea to ask if he could harm us, and he said no.  He then asked us to get off his bench, so we moved to one a couple hundred yards away.
<br><br>
When we used the ouija board again, Jack was still trying to talk with us.  We were a little apprehensive, seeing how he said he was bad.  But we asked him if anyone would be mad at us for sitting on this bench, and he told us no.  Laura then asked to talk to her spirit guide. She has never met her's before, so she had no clue who it was.  We got ahold of Laura's guide whose name is Kathy.   We were still apprehensive, because spirits can lie about who they are.  But we talked to her for a little bit.
<br><br>
We asked if Jack would follow us on our walk home, and she answered yes.  We asked if he would go into the house with us, and she answered yes.
We asked if he would try to hurt us, and she once again answered yes.  We asked if saying prayers would work, and she told us they would.  We said the prayer we found on your website, the Lord's prayer, and a prayer I made up; asking for forgiveness if we may have upset anyone, and asking to be protected by God.  Now, understand, we said a prayer before we started the ouija board.  We made sure we closed the board properly.
<br><br>
We got home, and a couple hours passed. We decided to try and contact Laura's guide once again.  We were able to talk to Kathy, and ask her questions.  But once we asked if Jack had followed us home, she went straight to &quot;goodbye.&quot;  Before we asked to talk to someone else, the board spelled out &quot;hello.&quot;  We asked who it was, and the indicator stayed still.  I asked if it was JM, for Jack.  The indicator moved to &quot;yes.&quot;  We said goodbye, and the indicator moved to &quot;Goodbye.&quot;
<br><br>
This is where we're not that smart.
<br><br>
I asked to talk to George.  Jack answered, and I closed the board.  We said our prayers, asking for the forgiveness of Jack for upsetting him, and asking for the protection of God.
<br><br>
I have no idea if Jack is still here, seeing how when we closed the board at the park, he was still able to follow us here.  Is there anything we might have done to actually take him into Laura's house?
<br><br>
Also, I'm a little frightened.  Awhile back, George had told me that if I contact evil spirits they would follow me home, because I am very easily scared at times.
<br><br>
Should we open and close another board?
<br><br>
Should we try another prayer?

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or information for Eri, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on.
