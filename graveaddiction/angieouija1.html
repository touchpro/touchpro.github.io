On August 28, 2005 I received an e-mail from Angie Galaviz about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Last night me and my brother made an ouija board, and played it.  It was about 7:00...maybe earlier or later,we had no clue of the right time.<br><br>
I'm 13, my name is Angie, and I live in Pampa, Texas.  My brother, Alex, is 11 years old, and my cousin, Trinity, who was helping us out, is 10.<br><br>
We lit 3 candles: blue, red, and orange.  We were going to light a black one, but the wick was screwed and Alex said it might attract bad spirits anyways.
<br><br>
We sat down and set the board in our laps.
<br><br>
The date was August 28,2005.
<br><br>  
Angie: Is there a spirit present?<br>
Board: Yes
<br><br> 
Angie: What is your name?<br>
Board: Michelle<br>
<br> 
Angie: How old are you?<br>
Board: 22<br><br>
 
Angie: Are you 22 years old?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Angie: Were you murdered?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Angie: Did you commit suicide?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br> 
 
Angie: Are you sad?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Angie: Would you like to befriend us?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Board: My dad is next to Angie.<br><br>
 
I (Angie) started crying...I was very scared.<br><br>
 
Trinity asked Michelle if her dad was going to hurt us.<br><br>
 
The Board starts to move to yes...but then went to no.<br><br>
 
Angie: Would your father like to befriend us to?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Angie: Is your dad on my right or left side?<br>
Board: On Alex Bed<br><br>
 
Me and Trinity looked at Alex's bed, and waved and said hi.<br><br>
 
Angie: Did your dad hear us say hi?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Board: He said hi<br>
Me and Trinity waved again.<br><br>
 
Angie: Michelle,what's your favorite colour?<br>
Board: Red<br><br>
 
Me and Trinity told her that red is one of our favourite colours too.<br><br>
 
Angie: What is your father's favorite colour?<br>
Board: Green<br><br>
 
Angie: Is your dad's favourite colour green?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Angie: What is your father's favourite holiday?<br>
Board: Christmas<br><br>
 
Angie: What is your favourite holiday?<br>
Board: Valentines<br><br>
 
Board: Can we all be best friends?<br>
Angie: Yes,but you can't stay here.<br><br>
 
Angie: Ok?<br>
Board: Yes.<br><br>
 
Board: I love you all, *board moves slowly to goodbye*<br><br>
 
That was a very amazing night for all of us, we talked to a little 3 year old named Dage before we talked to Michelle.  We asked him how he died, and he said, &quot;Dead Grogoj.&quot;  Alex later searched that...and it was in a different language.
<br><br> 
All of this is completely true...when we talked to Dage, we started laughing like crazy because of Trinity...we were waiting for him to answer, and out if nowhere she farted!  So I think we might have made him mad...I don't know, but we know now to take it all seriously after what happened that night.  And from our other visits on the day after that, we know it's true.&quot;
