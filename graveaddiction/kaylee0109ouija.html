On January 16, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kaylee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Kaylee.  I read some of the stuff on your website before playing the board, so I knew what to do. My four friends and I got together and began playing in my room. We all sat in a circle, and opened up the board. Right away it said there was a spirit present.  It went something like this:
<br><br>
Us: What's your name?<br>
Board: Derek<br>
<br>
Us: Are you good or bad?<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Us: So what exactly are you?<br>
Board: Vampire<br>
<br>
(at this point we were creeped out, we didn't think a vampire would contact us lol)
<br><br>
Us: Really? So how many others are with you?<br>
Board: 3<br>
<br>
Us: Is that your family?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What are their names?<br>
Board: Rachel<br>
<br>
Us: Is that your mom?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: How old is she?<br>
Board: 47<br>
<br>
Us: Who else?<br>
Board: Becky<br>
<br>
Us: Is that your sister?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: How old is she?<br>
Board: 7<br>
<br>
Us: Do you have a dad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What's his name?<br>
Board: Nedent<br>
<br>
Us: How old is he?<br>
Board: 49<br>
<br>
Us: Are there any other spirits in my house?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Good or bad?<br>
Board: Bad<br>
<br>
(then somehow we started talking to a demon, supposedly)
<br><br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Fernando<br>
<br>
Us: Are you bad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do you hurt people?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What can we do so you don't hurt us?<br>
Board: Read the bible<br>
<br>
Us: Any particular verse?<br>
Board: Galatians (something, it didnt make sense)<br>
<br>
Us: This doesn't make sense, is it just a random verse?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Can we talk to Derek? Please?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
DEREK<br>
<br>
Us: Is this Derek?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Derek, is there anyway you can get rid of Fernando for us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Will you do it now for us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: How long will it take?<br>
Board: 14 minutes<br>
<br>
Us: Can we talk to Rachel while you do that?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Then we talked to Rachel for a while.  She said she had a power to tell the future about friendship, and her daughter could tell the future about love.<br>
<br>
We talked to Derek again, and right away he told us:
<br><br>
Board: Go upstairs<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Right away<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Everyone<br>
<br>
Us: How long?<br>
Board: 10 minutes<br>
<br>
We went upstairs, and came back in exactly 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Us: Why did we have to leave?<br>
Board: Restroom<br>
<br>
Us: You or us?<br>
Board: Both<br>
<br>
The weird thing is we all went to the bathroom because we all had to pee super bad.<br>
<br>
Us: So what do you like about me?<br>
Board: Pretty<br>
<br>
Us: What else do you like about me?<br>
Board: Help<br>
<br>
Us: Help with what?<br>
Board: God<br>
<br>
Us: What do you like about Shelby?<br>
Board: Teeth<br>
<br>
Us: Do you like Amanda?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Bitch<br>
<br>
Us: Why is she a bitch?<br>
Board: Gossip<br>
<br>
Us: Who does she gossip about the most?<br>
Board: Brittney<br>
<br>
(wasn't there)<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anything you like about her?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What?<br>
Board: Butt<br>
<br>
Us: You like her butt?<br>
B: Yes<br>
<br>
We then talked to Nedent.<br>
<br>
Us: Can we call you Ned for short?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: So what are your special powers, Ned?<br>
Board: Die<br>
<br>
Us: Can you be more specific?<br>
Board: Die<br>
<br>
Us: What does that mean?<br>
Board: Kill<br>
<br>
We then said goodbye and put the board away.
