On April 7, 2007 I received an e-mail from Damien about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
So tonight me, three fellow friends, and a random girl decided that we would give the ouija board a whirl.  It was two males and three females, one of which did not participate.
<br><br>
We started off by lighting four red candles, and we put them at each corner of the board. At first only my best friend and his cousin, who is a female, started, and we got no results for at least a half hour. We were getting discouraged. But then all of a sudden the oracle began to inch its way across the board. We had a light of hope that it would work, so I decided to join along, and then the other female came out of her room from being in trouble for not taking it seriously.  We all layed our fingers upon the oracle and got down to business and became serious about it.
<br><br>
Then, to our amazement, it actually moved quite fast towards the yes after we had asked if there were any spirits willing to communicate with us. At that point our friends in the basement, who had no idea what we were doing, screamed up that an electronic dart board with a pretty hefty push button (to turn it on) came on. Immediately we became frightened.  Then at that moment another one of the females came out of the room and said that she felt something brush up her leg.  She had no idea we still were using the ouija board. So now we were totally freaking out. And along with this, everytime the oracle would move, every dog in the surrounding county was howling it seemed, then they would stop as the oracle stopped.  The ferrets were going crazy also as the oracle would move.
<br><br>
Then everybody else that was downstairs (because they were leaving) realized what we were doing, and of course they were non-beleivers until they saw what happened next...after we asked the board if it was an evil spirit to go to the moon and if it was a friendly spirit go to the sun, it darted to the moon halfway and stopped.  Then the candle went out and cold chills ran up all of our legs underneath the coffee table. Every hair on my neck stood up.  At this point me and my best friend removed our hats because I can assure you that if something would have knocked off our hats we would have been up shit creek and freaked out. We then became very frightened and asked the spirit if we could please say goodbye, and it kept moving towards no.  So I decided to call my dad (who owns the board and told us about it from his childhood) and asked him how to say goodbye to an evil spirit.  He repeated it to me, and we all said it and it actually stopped oracle dead center of the board.  We all were still in amazement that anything happened. We then said the final ending prayer and wiped the board with a dry cloth, blew out the three remaining candles, packed up the board, and reluctantly put it back in the car that we would be driving home later. We came back in the house and it was freezing. We also caught hell from the females' parents for having the ouija board in the house. So not bad for our first time, even though we did get scared shitless.  We are now making a homemade ouija board and will attempt it again when it is completely finished. And when the fear wears off. Be very careful - it isn't a game like you think, we learned it the hard way. We are all true believers now.
