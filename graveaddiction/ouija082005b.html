On August 12, 2005 I met up with Donna and T.C. at <a href="malabar.html">Malabar Farm State Park</a>.  Later that evening at their campsite, we decided to try and contact some spirits using the 1920's ouija board.  This was the last of three ouija sessions that took place that night.  It was the shortest at 17 minutes, 44 seconds.  Donna went to the tent to sleep, so it was just T.C. and I using the board.
