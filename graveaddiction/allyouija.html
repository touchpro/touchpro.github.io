On April 10, 2005 I received an e-mail from Ally Watson about her first time using the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Today was my first experience with a ouija board.  I never thought much of them before, but believed they worked. 
<br><br>
My two friends and I, hand on glass, started to ask questions (I trusted my friends wouldn't lie and say they moved it). Four people came through! 
<br><br> 
One was my friends uncle, he died when he was 18. He was wanting to apologize to a &quot;Steph&quot; who none of us knew. He mentioned she died with him, in a car crash. He wanted to apologize to her, but we didn't know what to say. Later, he went to goodbye and left.
<br><br>  
We asked if there was anyone else there, a 5 year old girl called Sarah Yeates. She got murdered by her mum. She got confused and scared and said goodbye, she came back, tried to spell out stuff, but left again.
<br><br>  
Third person, now this is really freaky, we asked if he or she liked us, he or she said no. We asked for the name, the initials wrote "G.R" and he flew to goodbye.
<br><br>  
The last spirit, called Danny was a girl, she claimed she wasn't dead and lived in Ellon, Scotland. She was upset because people were always laughing at her. She told us not to laugh. One of my friends watching laughed and she moved the glass so quickly, our hands slipped off, she was really upset. She started confusing us, telling us my friend Chris had lost her life and saying our friends were in danger and a lot of random sayings. She was being aggressive, so we let her go. But we asked her if she liked us, she replied with "of course". She never knew how she died. Or how old she was.
<br><br>  
This was our first experience and how we managed to get so many people, we don't know. But it happened, it was an experience.&quot;
