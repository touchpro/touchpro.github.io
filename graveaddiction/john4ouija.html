On April 1, 2007 I received an e-mail from John about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
One night, on the 30th of March, me and two friends of mine (Let's call them Alex and Steve-O.) were playing with Alex's mom's ouija board. The first two tries we got nothing, but the 3rd try we contacted something we wish we never had.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there that wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: *Nothing*<br>
<br>
Alex: Dude, this is stupid...let's just drop this shit and go do something else.<br>
Steve-O: Yo, board! Talk to us!<br>
Board: 9,8,7,6,5...<br>
<br>
Me: Who is this?<br>
Board: enoozs<br>
<br>
Me: You wanna try that again buddy?<br>
Board: Enzo<br>
<br>
Alex: Whats up, Enzo?<br>
Board: Very bored<br>
<br>
Alex: Hahaha. I thought being dead would be cool being able to fly and shit like that?<br>
Bored: No. Still boring<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know any of us, Enzo?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who?<br>
Board: All<br>
<br>
Steve-O: You know all of us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Board: Following<br>
<br>
Alex: You follow us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(At this time the room got instantly cold, as in dropping at least 15 degrees at least)
<br><br>
Me: Did you make the room cold?<br>
Board: Yes, just came in<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you?<br>
Board: Next to you<br>
<br>
(Right that second, I felt like a claw or something like a hand with sharp nails dig into my right shoulder slowly, but I didn't say anything.)
<br><br>
Board: Wasn't me.<br>
<br>
Me: Who was that?<br>
Board: Others<br>
<br>
Alex: You mean theres more than one ghost in this room?<br>
Board: Yes, two more<br>
<br>
Steve-O: Dude this is seriously getting a bit much<br>
Alex: Pussy<br>
<br>
Me: Are they good or evil?<br>
Board: Evil<br>
Steve-O: Really guys fuck this, if it's any of you cut it out!<br>
<br>
(After each swearing it wasn't any of us moving the cursor, someone or thing starting thrashing on the door like it was trying to get in. No one else was home at this time except us three, and all windows and doors where locked tight.)
<br><br>
All three of us: Fuck! (Over and over)<br>
Board: Hide 4,3,2,1<br>
<br>
(I was about to jump up to fucking smash open the window and jump out of it when I saw Alex and Steve-O fainted on the floor.  While all of this was happening the banging and thrashing on the door was still going on. I thought at this time its every man for himself, and stood up to get out of there when the door was flung open, nearly coming off its hinges.  What I saw next will forever haunt me for the rest of my life.
<br><br>
A totally black...creature of some sort, about 7-8 feet tall with huge red glowing eyes, bending over to get through the door came though and started sprinting towards me.
<br><br>
The next thing I know I wake up, its morning, the board is missing, every mirror in the room is smashed to bits, and Alex and Steve-O don't remember anything after the door starting to rattle.)
<br>v
I still have no idea what happened that night and probably never will. All I know is I'm never touching one of those boards again in my life. Hopefully its all over.
