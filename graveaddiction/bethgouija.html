On August 28, 2006 I received an e-mail from Beth Gilliam about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My mom and I live on what used to be Indian land that saw many battles in the French-Indian war. Anyway, me being the most perceptive person to paranormal activity in the whole area, I was shocked that this did not directly happen to me.
<br><br>
It was my best friend's birthday/New Year's party, and we were staying in a hotel across from the mall, just having a good time. There was me, Kira, Nicole, Tiffy, Brandon, Kelly, and Meghan there. It was about maybe 1 in the morning when Nicole mentioned that she brought her ouija board, which was glow in the dark, and asked if anyone wanted to &quot;play&quot;. Tiffy and I declined and went downstairs in the lobby for an hour or so while everyone else played. Like I said before, I'm no stranger to spirits and such and I didn't want to take my chances.
<br><br>
We went back to the room and they're done playing.  We all listened to music and talked until my friend Kira got very still and quiet (which hardly ever happens).  Then we heard her grunt. I walked over to her and started holding her legs and asked her if she could move at all, and she starting crying. I then knew something was wrong. Stupid me, being a newcomer in Wicca, started channeling my energy.  At first I was only feeding the entity because I was trying to pass my energy so Kira could use it, but at this point she was almost completely taken over.  Then my friend, Meghan, started grabbing her arms and asked &quot;Do you have anymore energy in you to give?&quot; &quot;Yes, but not too much&quot;, so she pinned Kira's arms to the bed while grunting, and then whoever was inside of her used her body to fight back.
<br><br>
Anyway, to make a long story short, Meghan started chanting something and told me to force what I had left to spare into her body. It took both of us to free her. Come to find out Meghan has been a closet Wiccan for years now, and was actually considering quitting the practice (Wiccans aren't exactly viewed as the pick of the litter). In the morning I asked what had happened with the ouija board, and Meghan said that someone who refused to say their name came through and said that he wanted to harm everyone.  I asked her if she closed the session and she said she was too freaked out that she threw it across the room and Nicole then put it away.
<br><br>
Kira ended up being fine, but we all get creeped out when we pass the hotel. She said it felt like being in the twilight stage of sleep, but being unable to control your own body.
<br><br>
SO WORD TO THE WISE: IF YOU WANT TO &quot;PLAY&quot; WITH AN OUIJA BOARD, AT LEAST CLOSE THE SESSION, AND MAKE ALL PARTY MEMBERS DO THE SAME.
