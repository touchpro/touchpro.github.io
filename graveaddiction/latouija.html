On January 25, 2006 I received an e-mail from Latasha Archuleta about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br><br>
I don't remember the dates, but in January of 2004 my mom and I started to use the ouija board with her friend, Marie. The
first spirit we got was named &quot;ZAZ&quot;. He claimed to be Marie's dead friend. My mom and Marie would talk to Zaz and a few other spirits every night, for a few months.
<br><br>
Well, some time in late August my mom says that if we hold a pen or pencil on a peice of paper, Zaz (or any other spirit) will write for us. I don't know exactly what you call this. Anyway, my aunt L tried this at my mom's house, and was talking to her dead nephew. She thought it was fun, and she later went home and did it by herself. Well, the next couple of weeks after that she would call my mom telling her weird things...that the spirits could talk to her in her head, etc. It got so bad that one night she grabbed her kids and took off in the middle of the night, flagged down a policeman, and started telling him that she had sex with the devil and the devil wants to kill her. They take her to the psychiatric ward at the hospital for a few days. When I went to see her, she said she was god. She would put her index finger down on a piece of paper...not a pen, because she said that the spirits were in her. So with her finger moving back and forth as if she was writing, she would talk in this weird voice. Not like demonic or anything, but she would talk as if she was reading run-on sentences with no breaths. She's gone to the church and taken communion, but she said it has gotten worse. That now she has nightmares all the time. She doesn't sleep anymore, and she is scared all the time. She says they show her images in her head.  I don't know what to do to help her. She doesnt do drugs or drink. And she doesn't have multiple personalities...they did a bunch of tests when she was in the hospital. ANY one know what I can do to help her? Please!!
<br><br><br>
<b>UPDATE</b>
<br><br>
In August 2006 I received an e-mail from Fervent regarding this story:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I thought it might interest you somewhat to know that I've been talking to a spirit calling itself Zaz since I was 14. I'm 28 now. I just shared my story with others recently. Here is a link to it: <a href="http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/2281983318/m/1431980138/p/1" target="_blank">http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/2281983318/m/1431980138/p/1</a>.
<br><br>
One of the posts I made a whole year ago said something about Demons pretending to be dead relatives. Zaz told me this was because the two 'stories' that hooked people meddling with Ouija boards the fastest was claiming that the Demon was a dead relative, or a murdered child. He said this was the best way to 'capture their attention.'</i></blockquote>
