On November 14, 2004 I received an e-mail from Keaton Richard about his creepy experience using the board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;It was late July 2004. I was close to being 13. I was spending the night at my friend's house.  He
was a few months younger than me, and I brought my board to his house. We let it sit in the light
and let it gather light so it could glow in the dark. We were in his basement, and his older
brother who was in high school asked if he could use the board. I explained how to do it, and we
turned off the lights so the only light was coming from it. He went in his room. Later he came out
shaken. He said he put his finger on one side, and he felt a tingling start at his finger tip and
spread to his hand. I didn't believe it, so I tried it myself. I put my finger lightly on it, and
asked it a question. I played it over and over again in my mind and soon, right where I was
touching it, the planchette seemed to shoot a tingling numbness into my finger. It spread and
reached the root of my finger. Keeping my eyes closed and my hand motionless, I felt the
planchette smoothly slide across the board, by itself. I was so freaked I stopped. And to this
day, I haven't removed the board from it's case.&quot;
