On August 1, 2007 I received an e-mail from Martha about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My friend Megan and I decided to use the ouija board that I had found in the basement of my lake house the other day. There was an escalating rate of spirits in the house, and they told us that we had opened a portal by bringing the board into the house. A spirit that we know by the name of Ralph who lives with my friend Ashley was trapped by three demons in my house. They would not tell us their names, but there was a constant fighting between them, resulting in a constant &quot;ACACACACACACACAC&quot; pattern. They told me that they would hurt me. Eventually we decided to end the session because we felt unsafe.
<br><br>
We went upstairs to research what could have been going on, but as we did so, we got dizzy, headaches, etc.  It gave us the feeling that they didn't want us doing that. Once we had eaten, we attempted to get some non-gibberish answers from the spirits.  We got yes or no answers for a bit, but after a while they just stopped responding normally altogether.
<br><br>
Megan told me that she wanted me to stay at her house, because the spirits were threatening and angry. I took the board to her house to see if we could get some answers. We went out to her shed, and spoke with two demons (one from my house, one from hers) who fought over the board almost constantly.  After half an hour, we decided to leave and go see if there were any spirits in the barn. We contacted a little boy about nine years old, but he was not allowed to talk to us.  We didn't want to get him in trouble, so we left. As we discovered in Megan's room, the little boy was being punished and the spirits were mad at us for talking to him. They told us that there was a religious fight in the spirit world and that we needed to leave them alone.
<br><br>
They would not tell us their names.
<br><br>
The next day the fight they spoke of was over, but they still would not speak to us.  This was weeks ago, but I still feel a hostile presence.  Any advice?
<br><br>
If you have any advice for Martha, please send me an e-mail (<a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">graveaddiction@gmail.com</a>) and I'll forward your tips on to her.
