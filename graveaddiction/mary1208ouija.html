On December 29, 2008 I received an e-mail from Mary L. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I remember the day it happened - March 23 (my birthday). I got a ouija board for my birthday, and like any other 15 year old would do, I played with it, right?
<br><br>
Well, I started to play with it, and it was 3:00 AM (AKA the Witching Hour).  I thought that if I did it at that time, I would surely get to talk to something.
<br><br>
And I did at about 3:15 AM.  I finally got a response as I asked questions.   I asked the name of this spirit I was talking to, and it replyed &quot;Lusiphur.&quot;  I believe that is how he spelled it, and last time I heard, it was the devil himself in the flesh.  I stopped talking to him, but at night I can hear whispers, noises, screaming, and crying. I can even hear fire crackling, and I smell things burning at night. Ever since this encounter, I wake up with scratches and bite marks.  I can't control myself anymore. I cut crosses in my arm to keep him away, but he won't leave.  I don't eat that much anymore. I snap at people, and that's not like me. I'm sick and I say things I don't understand, and as it goes on I really can't sit still. I go to church, but everytime I walk close to the building I start to hurt, like I'm burning.  I scream in pain. I'm in pain everyday, trying to get this away. Nothing else really happens, just this...THANK GOD!
<br><br>
Every night it happens.  I'm fine during the evening, but once it hits 3:00 AM I can't control it. The doctors think I am going to eventually die with all my wounds. All I know is that I WILL NEVER USE A OUIJA BOARD AGAIN!  Just don't ever use it and trust the one you are talking to!
<br><br><br>
If you have any comments or advice for Mary, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on to her.
