On August 31, 2005 I received an e-mail from Martin Blamowski about his scary ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;It was June, 1989. I was 15, and then it was my first and last experience with any Ouija Board. Me and my friends wanted a little party to celebrate the end of school year. Ok, so we went, it was boring and we wanted to have some fun. My girlfriend went down and took the Ouija Board out of her trunk. We were all happy seeing an old Ouija Board from 1972 (it even had the original price tag on it, $3.50!). All of my friends didn't believe that the board would work, but for god's sake it DID. So we sat down with the board and asked the first question: &quot;Is there anyone who would like to talk to us?&quot; It took a minute and the message indicator moved slowly and pointed to &quot;YES&quot;. My girlfriend thought that it was US moving it, because when she tried playing it nothing happened. We started arguing for like 15 minutes and finally I got so pissed that I went to the board and said the following words &quot;LORDS OF DARKNESS PROVE TO HER THAT YOU ARE REAL&quot;
<br><br> 
I will always regret what I said back then. And the hell really started. One of my firends told us that he had a headache and to be quiet. Two seconds later he fainted, and the light went off. We could a see a moonlight shadow of a tall man on the wall, and my girlfriend started screaming. The message indicator started moving and I could see that it's spelling out the following words (I couldn't understand the whole sentence though) &quot;wake&quot; &quot;listen&quot; &quot;die&quot; &quot;goodbye&quot;. I wonder why, I wasn't scared, nothing was scary about it... Then I heard my girlfriend scream &quot;Holy Shit!&quot; and I turned and I just couldn't believe my eyes. The shadow of the man that we saw before was flying above her and it looked like it's connected to her with red shadow... Then me...It looked so funny I started laughing, and I can't remember what happened after that but as my friends say I looked like I'm in some kind of trance...I was on the floor shaking and laughing. The only thing that I remember was that I felt so good...SO GOOD like I'm a God. I woke up the next morning in a hospital..I remembered I knew that I had to go. I woke up, got dressed up, and just escaped from the hospital. I called the rest of my friends...most of them were ok, but my girlfriend and Alan still didn't wake up. We waited in patience holding their hands...not saying a word...well nothing happened. We waited for two weeks and I took the Ouija Board alone and said &quot;Thanks for proving it...but I still want my friends back&quot; and then It said &quot;You're welcome..you believe&quot;
<br><br>
I went to the hospital and saw them laughing and talking with their parents. Huh, they couldn't see me so I went out really happy. They never knew what happened and I didn't tell them.&quot;
