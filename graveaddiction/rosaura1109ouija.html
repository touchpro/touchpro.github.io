On November 17, 2009 I received an e-mail from an anonymous website visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

To be honest I never really believed that the Ouija was a portal between our world and the death. I took the Ouija as a game, and now I seriously regret ever playing it.  Because after I finished playing it, weird things started happening around my house. I played it by myself which makes it worse, because I cannot tell anybody. And when random stuff happens, I know why it is happening and I cannot do anything about it. A lamp which was brand new exploded, something keeps knocking on my bed frame at night, and my sisters are complaining that they are hearing a woman's whispers.
<br><br>
These events make me really scared, but I have to be strong. Because I was the one that opened that portal, and I will be the one to close it. But what really troubles me, is that when I was playing with the Ouija board, I asked when I was going to die. The planchette just kept going to number 20, and I didn't give it any thought. But then at night I couldn't sleep because I felt some presence next to me. So I woke up and started doing some work for school. When I ran across a calendar, and that day falls in a Friday. I got real scared because this Friday, the 20th, I'm going to a party, where a lot of the people whom will attend are involved with drugs. Today is November 17, 2009 and I don't know what to do. Because if I don't go to that party, I'm giving the Ouija board the power to control my life. But if I go, will I die??
