On November 2, 2006 I received an e-mail from Michaela about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This is an ouija board story that my friend Kim told me.  She would never lie to me, so here it is...
<br><br>
I was out at my best friend Kim's mother's house (they live at a lake). We were all sitting around the campfire and somehow we got on the subject of ouija boards.  Kim told us her ouija board story, which has freaked her out ever since and she won't go near them ever again.
<br><br>
Kim said that she and some friends were playing with the ouija board. They were talking to a guy named Sunni (or Sunny, I'm not sure how its spelled). Sunni said that he died at Crystal Lake in Marion, Ohio (where Kim lived at the time...in Marion, that is). At the time he died, Crystal Lake was an ammusement park and had roller coasters and different rides like that. He died when he fell off a roller coaster into the lake below and drowned. That's all she remembered asking Sunni that night. Well, a few weeks later her dad told Kim that he was going to buy Crystal Lake and she freaked out!  She tried to tell him the story, but he didn't believe her and he did end up buying the lake and a lot of property around it. They still live there to this day. I believe that there have been a few deaths at Crystal Lake, but I'm not completely sure.  Most were drownings. Well, after Kim finished her story, I kid you not, we all heard a splash into the lake over by where the roller coaster was located and none of us to this day will go swimming over at that part. So believe what you want, but I think these things are for real.
