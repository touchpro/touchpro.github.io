On May 2, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jan Lewanski about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My brother's friend and I were having a birthday party back in the summer of 2005.  As the night was wearing down, we broke out the ouija board. I had an experience with one during a previous summer that made me a believer, so I was curious as to what might come up this time.
<br><br>
Well, after speaking to several spirits who sounded more than legitimate due to facts they told us that only certain people in our group could confirm, we came upon one that seemed to mostly just want to joke around and have a laugh or two. Well in the end, in addition to it giving us joke names as to who all of us would marry, I asked the group of people in the opposite room who were behind closed doors what I should ask it. They told me to ask it who really killed the radio star. I laughed and said I would, so I left that room, went into the ouija room, and had everyone quiet down.  I then asked it &quot;Who REALLY killed the radio star?&quot; The planchette stopped for a second, and proceeded to answer: O-J-S-I-M-P-S-O-N. That's right - According to that spirit, OJ Simpson killed the radio star! Needless to say, everyone started laughing.  I went into the other room, closing both doors behind me, and after hyping them up for the answer I
hushed them and slowly told them the answer. The 10 or so people in the room erupted into applause.
<br><br>
It's been the funniest experience I've had so far with the board. Since then we've contacted a murdered girl, several elemental spirits, and at least one spirit/entity who tried to physically attack us by using the board as a portal so to speak.  But nothing has been as interesting and funny as that spirit. Believe me when I say that I feel the ouija board is
an extremely useful tool.
