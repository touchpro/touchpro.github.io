<br><br>
I visited the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum on September 13, 2008.  I went on one of the historical tours, as well as a night ghost hunt.  It is by far the creepiest place I have visited yet!
<br><br>
I took way too many photos, so I have divided them into the following sections:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="talaext.html">Exterior Photos</a>
<li><a href="talafirst.html">First Floor Photos</a>
<li><a href="talasecond.html">Second Floor Photos</a>
<li><a href="talathird.html">Third Floor Photos</a>
<li><a href="talafourth.html">Fourth Floor Photos</a>

</ul>
<br>
<b><u>A brief history of the building</u>:</b>
<br><br>

The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum is also known as the Weston State Hospital.  It was constructed between 1858 and 1881, and was designed by architect Richard Andrews.  It is one of the last remaining Kirkbridge buildings in the United States (a design that was created by Thomas Kirkbride).  It is also the largest hand-cut stone building in North America, and is believed to be the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin in Russia. The hospital was closed in 1994.
<br><br>
Many people believe the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum is haunted by former patients and staff.  People claim to hear laughter, and see shadows and apparitions.  Other common signs, such as battery drainage and cold spots, are also reported.
<br><br>
I received an e-mail from Sarah S. in April 2012 about her visit to the asylum:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>My name is Sarah. I had visited the asylum 2 days before Halloween for the Bedlam Ball.  I did one tour and it was amazing.  I didn't see anything, but when we got our pictures back there were orbs and there wasn't any dust or anything in the building. I also got a picture of a man's face. I have 2 pictures of that.  It looks like an older man with a longer beard. It's really good! When I left I felt like something was wrong with me.  My body shook for a good 2 hours after we left. It was extremely weird. My arms and legs trembled and I was not scared there at all. I find this type of thing very interesting.</i></blockquote>
