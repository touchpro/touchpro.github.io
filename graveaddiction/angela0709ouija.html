On July 19, 2009 I received an e-mail from Angela S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Supposedly,  you are supposed to dip your fingertips in wax to prevent spirits from coming through you or to prevent demonic posession.  My friend Dani was huge into the ouija board when we were in high school, and she did this religiously.  She also never ended a session without saying good-bye to the spirit she was conversing with.  Except for one morning when she and my friend Karen were playing before school in Dani's bedroom.  They were talking to a spirit, and they had stupidly asked it to prove it's presence. It wouldn't do anything, so they were provoking it.  While they were doing this, the bus came and they broke the connection.  When they got on the bus, Dani could see her candle burning in the window---which hadn't been burning while they were there.  She convinced herself that she had imagined it until they were out of their little town and on their way to where our school was and heard the call for firetrucks to go the Chuckwagon Bar and Grill where Dani lived.  Yep. Their entire house burned down along with her dad's business.  It was pretty crazy stuff.
<br><br>
My other story is of a bunch of us playing at a friends house.  It creeps me out to this day!!  It was really late on Halloween one year, and a few of my friends, including a BIG guy named Rob.  It was kind of blizzarding outside, and we were stuck indoors and figured HEY Ouija Board!!!!  Sam and Lisa were on the board sitting on the floor, while the rest of us sat on the bed watching.  Rob didn't really believe in the whole idea of the spirit board, so Sam asked the spirit named Jeff to prove that it was there.  It did and then some!  It pinned Rob to the bed so much so that he couldn't move.  Rob was 6' 3" and a fullback on our high school football team. It totally freaked us all out, so we grabbed the Ouija board and took it out of town so they could burn it.  A few weeks later, Sam and Lisa went out to see the board right where we had burned and left it, and it was gone.  I suppose it is possible that someone had seen it and picked it up, but it is still a mystery!  We have been out of high school for 14 years and we STILL talk about that!
<br><br>
My last story is the one that made me believe in it, and was my first experience with a ouija board.  My friends Loretta and Patti and I were in Loretta's car, and they were on the board.  I  had just started dating Aaron and wanted them to ask the spirit something only I would know the answer to.  Aaron's Grandma had just passed away the day before, so they asked it what Aaron's Grandma's name was.  The spirit spelled out L-O-U-I-S-E.  It was right.  Then they asked what she died of.  It spelled out S-U-R-G-E-R-Y.  They asked it what kind, and it spelled out B-R-A-I-N -C-A-N-C-E-R.  Again it was correct.  She died on the the table while they were removing the large cancerous tumor in her brain.  That kind of freaked me out.  But when it spelled out S-H-E-I-S-H-E-R-E.  I had to leave.  It kind of felt like something sucked the air right out of my lungs. I have believed in it ever since!
