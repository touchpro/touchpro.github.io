     I work at Lakin State Hospital. I visited the site of Lakin Hosp. where Jeremy C., Jeremy L., and Angie took pictures of the buildings and of the building across the road, great pics. However, the smaller building (across the road) is to the right and in front of the newest part of Lakin Hosp.(where I work as a Nurses Aide, and my grandmother as cook for the past 23yrs.) the new buildings are in fact the nuring home. It connects to the old kitchen (which has been renovated but still looks old)and below the kitchen is the basement where laundry and storage are for the 150+ resident home. The basement was used long,long ago for shock therapy and also a mortuary. I have to go down there sometimes for blankets, towels, washcloths,etc. when we run out on the units (where residents rooms are). I have many stories about this place, but I wanted to tell a little about the big,old building across the road. The summer of 2002 my wife (my fiance at the time), our friend Michael, and I went into the building at approx. 2 a.m. The night was very calm outside, no wind, full moon, very warm outside, perfect night for energy. We went in and the building was loud, you could hear the energy in the walls, floors, and ceilings. Unlike the photos, the building now is slowly falling to pieces. A few places on the 2nd and attic floors are beginning to fall through, so if ya visit be very careful. Any how, I had never been in before so I was skeptical about all of the stories I've heard about the place. But I found out the hard way. The place felt very erie like someone following you or watching you. This building was also an orphanage home for african american boys after the assylum. we found a closet on the main floor containing files of the children who were there, The files had some info. about the boys plus a few pages of finger prints. We kept a few documents and asked our ouija board, but that's another story. All throughout the place you could feel the warm outside air but there were several places of cold spots. Those were the places where it felt most erie. We ventured upstairs, but there wasn't a whole lot up there a few chairs but that was it. We went on to the attic but, couldn't get the big steel door open. After prying on it for about 15 min. I got it open, but when we got inside the door it slammed shut!!! We freaked and it felt like something didn't want us there. I got the door open and we got out quick. We got outside and looked back at the house, and I found an old concrete staircase outside to the basement. From the top looking down you could see an old fullsize mattress at the bottom, so we went down. We got to the bottom and the door was open, the only thing we could see was an old baby bassinet that was the only thing in there that was white, but we didn't dare go in. We left immediately. The following day we told a few other friends about our experience so they decided to see for themselves, but the baby carriage wasn't seen and no one else recollected a baby bassinet when they had been there before for at least the past 5 yrs. The house is big a erie at night that's for sure, but I'll never go back in. I can tell you lots more stories about Lakin that I have learned from elderly, parents, and locals that may be fictional or nonfictional, also stories about TNT area. But I'll leave you this right now. However, any questions u can e-mail me at dannie@citynet.net anytime. I know plenty of good stuff about the Mason Co.,Lakin Hosp., and TNT area. Why shouldn't I, I grew up here and I have always explored things. C-ya.2
