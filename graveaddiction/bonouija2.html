On December 3, 2005 I received an e-mail from Bonnee about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits who wish to come through and speak with us?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jane: Smart move, but now we know you are here.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Would you like to talk to a certain person or just here for fun?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Espy: Okay, not wanting to be rude, but STOP SPELLING NO!!!<br>
Board: Ok<br>
<br>
<i>we started laughing</i><br>
<br>
Lara: My turn!! Can you tell us your name?<br>
Board: ghshjbgfogh<br>
<br>
Lara: Can you try that again?<br>
Board: Virginia<br>
<br>
Me: Virginia, can I call you Ginny?<br>
Board: Whatever<br>
<br>
<i>we started laughing again</i><br>
<br>
Espy: So Virginia, how old are you?<br>
Board: 14<br>
<br>
<i>I started getting teary-eyed, that was so young to die!!</i><br>
<br>
Espy: How are you today?<br>
Board: Just dandy but I am having a toothache<br>
<br>
<i>we started laughing so hard!!</i><br>
Board: No laugh. Not funny. Tooth hurt.<br>
<br>
Me: Sorry Ginny. Can you answer some questions for us?<br>
Board: Sure, but quick. Show almost on<br>
<br>
Me: Are you kidding??<br>
Board: Yes ask.<br>
<br>
Jane: Okay, what is it like to die?<br>
Board: Peaceful. People are waiting for you and they are always smiling. It got annoying when you discover what happened.<br>
<br>
Lara: Wow. Another. Umm...who will Jane marry?<br>
Board: Whoever asks her.<br>
<br>
<i>we were cracking up!!!</i><br>
<br>
Lara: Seriously, please answer.<br>
Board: hoolawljgf<br>
<br>
Lara: Huh?<br>
Board: Peter Candin<br>
<br>
<i>we laughed at the name, and teased Jane.</i><br>
Board: No tease. Nice boy. Money good. Kids 7.<br>
<br>
Jane: I will have 7 kids?!<br>
Board: You did NOT hear it from me!<br>
<br>
<i>We were laughing again. Really hard. We laugh a lot in this session.</i><br>
<br>
Espy: Who will Lara go out with, Harry or Greg?<br>
Board: None. They are smart but stupid. Mean to girl.<br>
<br>
Lara: Thank you.<br>
Board: np <i>we think it means no problem</i><br>
<br>
Me: When did you die?<br>
Board: 2004<br>
<br>
Me: I am sorry<br>
Board: Don't b. Better parties here.<br>
<br>
<i>We were still laughing.</i><br>
<br>
Jane: Well, it is getting late.  Can we speak with you tomorrow? Same time and place?<br>
Board: Depends<br>
<br>
We went home and Jane swore she saw the reflection of a young girl with blonde hair and green eyes.  When we went on the next session, Ginny described herself for Jane.  Blonde hair, bluish-green eyes.  She then said she moved in with Jane and her family. She liked Jane. She was funny, and she thought she was safe. On several accounts when we have slumber parties or anything like that, we invite Ginny. She always livens things up by making something move and freaking out our other friends!
