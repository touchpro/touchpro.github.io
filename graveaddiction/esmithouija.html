On July 16, 2007 I received an e-mail from Emily J. Smith about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
It was Friday July 13 and me, my friends Kayla, Maddie, Kristen, and my brother Ben. We were playing with the Ouija and we decided to ask silent questions in our head so nobody could cheat. Ben asked in his head: If I get married to Lindsay Lohan, will we have five kids?
<br><br>
He did not put his hand on the board, but sat there and waited. The board spelled out WTF. We all started cracking up.
<br><br>
Next, Kayla asked her question: What is my cousin's boyfriend's name? She sat there and waited while the rest of us sat there and waited. The board again spelled out WTF. We laughed, again, and started wondering why it wouldn't spell out the right answer. We decided we probably weren't asking them clear enough.
<br><br>
Next it was Maddie's turn. She asked the board: What is my Yahoo password? She sat there and waited while the rest of us put our hands on the board. The board spelled out Y-U-M-M-Y. We sat there and asked what her question was, and she told us and then sat there looking really scared. She was about to cry, but then we all realized that this was a good thing and that this had to be a pretty funny spirit we were dealing with.
<br><br>
So if you ever play with the Ouija, be sure to ask your questions very clearly.  And if you don't ask dangerous questions, nothing dangerous will happen to you.
