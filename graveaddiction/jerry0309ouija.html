On March 5, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jerry A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Jerry. I'm 28 years old. I've always been very fascinated with the paranormal, but too afraid to ever take it any further. Well, a few weeks ago I purchased a Ouija board (from Toys-R-Us, awesome), and me and four other friends decided to give it a shot. For three of us, it was our first time. We were all very confident - I've read every single Ouija story you have posted, and from those compiled my own &quot;do's and dont's&quot; list. The other people were in their mid 30's, and had a moderate amount of experience with the board.
<br><br>
First off, the two experienced players, we'll call them T and E, started moving the planchette in circles, &quot;warming&quot; it up. The first question I asked was, &quot;Is there anybody here that would like to talk to us?&quot; The board went to yes, and the garage door flew open. Not even kidding, the door flew open. We knew we were talking to something coming through pretty strong. Every time I had my hands on it, the planchette would not move. Whenever somebody else had their hands on it (we were all taking turns, two at a time), it would move and answer questions. When another friend, we'll call her SH, asked if I could place my hands on it, the board went to no. Then she asked, &quot;Is there somebody here that you don't like?&quot; After that she asked, &quot;Who do you not like?&quot; The board then spelled my initials, followed by the year I was born. Naturally I was kinda upset, what did I do to the board?? When asked why, the board could not get anything spelled out to make sense. We talked to three different spirits that night, none of which liked me. No big deal.
<br><br>
So this past Tuesday we decided to try again, and we got a very strong presence from what E believes is his spirit guide since he has talked to her for the last 17 years. When asked if I could place my hands on the planchette, it went to no. Putting them on it anyway, it went straight to goodbye.
<br><br>
Then we asked if anyone else would like to speak with us , and it went straight to goodbye three times.
<br><br>
It did actually move when I had my hands on it on Tuesday, but I'm still a little confused. Now here's the interesting part.  My Mother passed away in 2005. We were talking a long time ago about this kind of stuff.  And she had seen a very, very respectable clarivoint one time.  She predicted the death of her mother, one child, and stated about a curse placed upon my family long ago.  She also stated that she was not powerful enough to remove it. Well, it was right about her mother, and she had a miscarriage shortly thereafter. I'm a bit of a skeptic, and I've never told that to anybody, but if anyone could point me in the right direction I would hope it's you. I'm wondering if the people I've attempted to contact through Ouija can somehow sense what's going on. I am a successful single guy who is pleased with the way his life is. I maintain a very positive and strong attitude everyday. But over the last few months I've really struggled. Think it could be anything with this so called curse?  Feel free to publish this story. It's all true, every last word. And if anybody could help me that would be outstanding. I'm gonna continue to try Ouija.
<br><br>
Thanks to you all. God Bless and keep you safe.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Jerry, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will send it on to him.
