On August 7, 2006 I received an e-mail from Justin Mutters about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Hey, my name's Justin and I just thought I'd send you my scariest ouija experience that happened to me just last night...
<br><br>
I was sitting in my room at about 1:45 AM last night with no lights on except for my T.V.  I foolishly decided to get out my ouija board to see if I could get a response by myself...going into it, I didn't expect anything to happen because I was alone and it has never worked before when I tried it alone...this time would be different.
<br><br>
I sat there on my bed for about 15 minutes, asking if anyone was there and nothing was happening.  I was about to just give up, but then I got this really HUGE cold chill that went all over my whole body.  So then I asked once again if someone was there...big mistake!  I felt the planchette trying to move, but it wasn't having much success.  Next thing I know, I look up and my T.V. goes out by itself right in front of me!  I jumped up so fast and bolted out of that room and stood in my living room for a minute...it scared the crap out of me!
<br><br>
I stood there for about 5 minutes shaking like crazy, and then I had to laugh because I thought it was funny that I got so scared over that.  That ghost had to be cracking up when it saw me bolt out of there...to make me even more scared, my cats all started acting like they were scared and they kept running in and out of my room...I didn't sleep very much last night.  LOL, I was already a believer in ouija boards before this experience but now there's absolutley no doubt in my mind that they're no game...I can't wait to do this again...hehehe!
