On September 4, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kelvin about another interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Here is the transcript of our second Ouija board session...this one was a lot more exciting to type up the transcript for, as I picked up at least one solid EVP while watching the video, with at least one more possibility.  Let me know what you think.<br>
=======================================================================================
