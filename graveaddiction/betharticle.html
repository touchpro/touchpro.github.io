You can learn these things about Beth *Removed for Privacy* without meeting her:
<ul>
<li>She's 23.
<li>She's a systems analyst at <i>company name</i>.
<li>She had a really weird dream on Jan. 7 that her friend Chrissie and Chrissie's new boyfriend, Raj, were trying to take over the world with a glittery green manual and a computer diskette.  
<li>*Removed for Privacy* writes these tidbits for all to see on her Web log -- commonly called a "blog.''
</ul>
She's a blogger. Blogs are all over the Internet. The Web site <a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="blank">www.blogger.com</a> has more than a million registered users.
<br><br>Some bloggers write about their political views, some about the tour dates for their bands. *Removed for Privacy* writes about her day-to-day life. On Jan. 17, she dropped John's carpet cleaner off at Ryan's house. On Dec. 13, her parents had to put a family dog, Cherokee, to sleep (but didn't tell her for more than a week).
<br><br>For the regular surfer, the accounts of boring workdays and weekends exploring old cemeteries are strangely addictive. For *Removed for Privacy*'s far-flung friends, the blog is a way to keep up. For *Removed for Privacy* herself, there's a freedom that she doesn't usually feel.
<br><br>&quot;I've always been a shy person,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't express myself, especially with strangers.&quot;
<br><br>The blog gets a lot of strangers because it's part of *Removed for Privacy*'s larger Web site, www.hoppytogether.com. She has about a dozen pet frogs, and the site is a way to talk about their care and show them off.
<br><br>She has pictures of them dressed like Santa and witches on the appropriate holidays. Search for "frog care'' on Google, and *Removed for Privacy*'s site comes up among the results.
<br><br>So people get to her site that way, then they can click on a link to her blog.
<br><br>Five people she has never met read about her life regularly -- one each from the Philippines, Pennsylvania, New York, California and Dayton. A computer program lets *Removed for Privacy* keep track.
<br><br>On Nov. 11, they learned she got her jury duty postponed for two months. (On Feb. 12, she was selected as an alternate juror for a trial and didn't get to vote on the verdict.)
<br><br>Life is not always so humdrum. *Removed for Privacy* is pretty sure that she has a haunted tablecloth -- the candleholders on top keep moving around on their own. And while she was trying to write a blog entry about the tablecloth on Nov. 18, the computer mysteriously turned off. The frogs sure aren't doing that.
<br><br>She grew up in Baltimore, about 25 miles southeast of Columbus in Fairfield County. After 18 months at Eastern Michigan University and a temporary spot at <i>company name</i>, the company offered her a full-time job in 1999. She's completing her degree at DeVry University and lives in the Short North.
<br><br>*Removed for Privacy* has run the frog site for about 2 1/2 years. The blog will be a year old in May.
<br><br>"When she first did it, I was very upset,'' said her mother, Karen *Removed for Privacy*. "That's a lot of information out there.''
<br><br>But Mrs. *Removed for Privacy* has turned the blog into an advantage: She keeps tabs on her daughter by reading it every day. If she notices that one of the time-stamped entries is late, she'll call her the next day.
<br><br>&quot;Nosy is not the word I'd use,&quot; Mrs. *Removed for Privacy* said. &quot;I'm an informed mom.&quot;
<br><br>And that person in the Philippines is an informed stranger, which is fine, Beth *Removed for Privacy* said. She understands her readers.
<br><br>&quot;It's fun to have a peek into someone else's life.&quot;
