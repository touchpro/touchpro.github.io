On August 3, 2005 I received an e-mail from twenty-two year old Kyna Fox in Columbus, Ohio about her creepy ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Back in college, my ex-boyfriend, myself, and two of our friends decided to try out the ouija board for the first time.  I had never had much interest in ouija boards, simply because I am a chicken at times when it comes to the paranormal.  We all sat around in a circle in my ex-boyfriend's dorm room and lit a couple candles and proceeded to play.  We asked the general questions that everyone seems to ask...&quot;is there anyone here?&quot;...&quot;what is your name?&quot;...&quot;when did you die?&quot;.  The first time didn't work out too well, so we retired for the evening and vowed to try again the next night.
<br><br> 
I decided that we must have been going about it all wrong, so I surfed the internet to see if I could gather some tips on how to conjour spirits using the ouija board.  I found a chant from a certain website about how to &quot;open up&quot; the board.  I also found a couple tips on how to clear the board at the end of play.  I went back to explain to the others what we had to do differently.
<br><br> 
The next night, we proceeded to try again.  This time, with the chant I had found, it worked.  We came into contact with a spirit that would not reveal his/her name.  It spelled out random things constantly.  My ex had been talking to the board the whole time, so we decided that I should try.  I didn't think there was much to it, so I started asking about my great-grandfather that had passed away back in 2000.  I asked if he was there and the board said &quot;yes&quot;.  I asked what he used to call me as a child for a nickname...the board spelled &quot;QT&quot;, which is correct.  Grandpa used to call me &quot;Cutie&quot; all the time as a kid.  No one else could have known this.  I then decided to ask the board how old grandpa was when he died...the board replied &quot;82&quot;, which I said was incorrect...I was almost positive he was 81 years old when he died.  We continued on with the board for a few minutes and didn't get much of a response, so we ended for the night.  The next day, I decided to double check the board's answer with my mom.  The freaky part?  The board was correct!  Grandpa was 82 when he passed...I was wrong and the board, or grandpa, was right.
<br><br> 
We tried a third time a few nights later, only to discover that someone with the initials of &quot;CG&quot; has taken over the board.  Every time we would try to talk to someone, CG would be there.  He would trick us, tease us and eventually made us upset, so we decided to leave the board alone for a while.  A couple days after that, I was in study hall with my ex and we were sitting quietly and doing our homework.  I needed a break, so I thought we should try to make a ouija board out of plain notebook paper to pass the time.  My ex agreed and we recruited a couple other friends to join in.  We sat there for about 15 minutes and the planchette barely moved.  We were able to get an answer or two, but nothing of actual importance.  We decided to stop and I picked up the paper and threw it away.  I came back to the place I was sitting at and the initals &quot;CG&quot; were carved into the table.  There is no way my ex could have done this, since I had been with him the whole time and was only gone for about 10 seconds to throw away the piece of paper.
<br><br> 
The next night, my ex was out at a party and I decided to go to bed early since he wasn't home yet.  I was staying in his dorm room, where the origional ouija session had taken place.  I remember just being able to drift off to sleep and I felt the sinking feeling of someone lying on the bed next to me.  I thought my ex had come home early, so I turned over only to realize that there was nobody there!  I threw the covers up over my head and tried to forget about what happened and just go to sleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling of someone lying down beside me.  Then, I felt what seemed like the back of a hand sweep across my cheek -- and that's when I lost it!  I flew out of bed and turned on the light and stayed up all night until my ex came back to his room.  I told him about it and we slept all night with the light on.  The next day, I made him bless the room with a gold cross that had been dipped in Holy water that he had recieved a couple years earlier and nothing weird ever happened again.
<br><br> 
A couple months after this, we decided to try one more time...it didn't work.  We had no response what-so-ever after about 50 minutes of trying.  I guess blessing the room really worked.  Thank goodness!&quot;
