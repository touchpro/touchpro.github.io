		<div class="content">Good Morning Everyone,<br /><br />Well I survived the party Saturday night.  My home was invaded by strange people.  First a couple walked in with a little person thing....whatever, it had big blue eyes and stared at me.  Mommy's mommy made over the "thing".  Made no sense to me, it did not even purr or yowl.  Prior to that the house had pretty much been in an uproar most of the day.  Mommy had things to do elsewhere so she wasn't around until evening but her mommy and daddy were crazy.  Mommy's mommy was cooking and cleaning and running back and forth from the house to the barn.  Mommy's daddy mostly stayed up at the barn...probably safer for him there and luckily the elongated rodent-dogs were with him.  Mommy's mommy also cussed lots, wow she has a foul mouth, and kept watching the weather channel...like the forecast was going to change if she said the right swears in the right combination...whatever, she can be strange.  Then Beth the Brutal came and she went up to the barn and decorated.  Mommy and her friend Mike had done lots of stuff Friday (because they wanted to contribute too) but Beth the Brutal Decorator (and she is a brutal decorator) finished up.  She has this thing about graveyards and made one up by the barn.  She is definitely different...maybe strange would be a better word.  Anyway, back to Saturday, Mommy and Mike came home and started to help light things up...Beth the Brutal had no patience left and said to hell with lighting the pumpkins but Katy and Mike did that...Mike is determined and patient...maybe bordering on obsession...anyway, just my thoughts and he did get the job done.  Mommy's mommy came in with a lady and the lady had another one of those little creatures with her, they kinda look human but they are so small.  That lady sat down and fed her little one just like a mama cat....did not know humans did that.  She was down in my domain for a long time and I stared, she didn't seem to mind as a matter of fact she was rude and totally ignored me!!!  hmmmmph, well I did not think her kitten was all that cute but mommy's mommy did...whatever.  There were a few others in and out but I hid and stared.  Mommy's mommy brought a lady down to the house and the lady said I was pretty but I did have a sorry tail...like who is she to make a comment like that about my thin but aristocratic tail, but at least she said I was pretty and she petted me and she knew how a cat likes to be touched.  She could visit me again.  However, I did make sure to give a little attitude and have huge yellow eyes.  From my window seat the party looked like what humans enjoy, big fire, lots of food (I could smell it and did not get one bite!), people laughing and talking and there was a tractor and a hay wagon.  Lots of people went on a ride and they seemed to have fun...what pretending to be a bale of hay.  Silly people.  So the party came and went and the family has been cleaning up since.  Mommy's mommy has been sighing lots this week.  Saying something about the Halloween celebration being over but Thanksgiving and Christmas being right around the corner.  She seems tired already.  I love Thanksgiving, she makes a big turkey and is pretty generous with samples and Christmas is busy but she puts lights on a tree.  More about that later but if Christmas is a season of good will why does mommy's mommy cuss so much???  Not a question that even a cat like me can answer.<br /><br />So life has been pretty exciting.  The long haired mutants that I must share the house with are pretty darned stinky, they have been outside a lot.  Soon, before the big holidays, they will be getting bathed....heheheheeeeee, they look like fat, wet rats.  I hope that happens soon, I will tell you all about it.  The only bad thing is once in a while Mommy's mommy thinks I need bathed.  She doesn't understand that cleaning myself with my perfect tongue is enough....she thinks I need soap and water, the bitch.  I will get a couple of good scratches in should she do that.  Plus I will be angry with mommy and try to make her upset too, yowling at night works.<br /><br />The little bastard dogs have been eating my food lately....lots.  My bowl has dog mouth germs in it and not a bite of food.  Mommy forgot to refill my bowl before going to bed the other night so at three in the morning I reminded her....until she got up at 5 I reminded her.  I yowl, I purr, I walk on her...but she was like a worm in a cocoon and would not get up.  I hope she has bruises on her from where I walked all over her lumpy sleeping form.  Next time she will remember to feed me or I will poop outside the crapper.  Then she will get in trouble the heifer-pottamus that she is.  Better still, a nice little fart in her face would be sure to get her up to feed me.  She tries to be a good mommy but sometimes she just isn't.<br /><br />Crisis last night!!!  I wandered out into the family room, territory of the asshole licking dogs, and mommy's mommy caught me, squashed me to the floor, then picked me up.  I wanted none of that so I stabbed her in her nice soft belly with my back claws.  She told mommy to get me off her....I am Master of My Universe, that cow won't squash me again.  Mommy knows to rescue then let me do what I want...I almost gutted her one time.  Don't mess with this Lady, I AM BAD TO THE BONE!!!<br /><br />Well better go for now.<br /><br />Rattster......</div><br>

		<div class="content">Can you believe Mommy's mommy laughed at me last night while I was sitting on the bed with mommy?  She told mommy that I am so fat that she could use me for a table.  Pig, she should go look in the mirror, she ain't model quality either unless she wants to model for Fat Clothes R Us.  I might be a little heavy but heck, some people like robust ladies.  I hear there are even clubs where men can go find nice, healthly, beefy ladies.  Us cat ladies need a club like that, sometimes I wouldn't mind a little male companionship, after all, I am only 9.<br />Finally mommy cleaned my litter box Sunday.  She pretty much had to because mommy's mommy was getting fed up with my deposits on the floor.  Fed up is such a mild term for the unleashed anger I heard when she let mommy know that box needed changed TONIGHT!!!  Ahhhh, a clean litter box, one of life's little pleasures.<br />Mommy has been tired lately, think she is trying to catch a cold.  She also works too much, first work with OT, then school, then quiliting.  She needs to stay home and watch TV and pet me.  I could really use a good brushing too.  I HATE being brushed but am starting to worry that I might just have to cough up a hairball and the worry part comes in when I try to decide when and where to do it.  Do I wait until 3 in the morning when everyone is fast asleep, warm and snug in their beds, and then start yakking away in the hallway.  I am a very good yakker, some of the noises I make could gross out the people on Fear Factor.  Now that is a TV show that could really make use of my hair balls or hair logs as I like to think of them: "Tonight your challenge will be to eat one of these hair balls made exclusively for our show by Splotches, Ruler of All".  Most of the contestants would quit right then.  For now however, I wil just have to think about where I can leave one that will cause the most uproar.  Mommy's daddy is the first one up and right inside the pass through to the kitchen is the best place...5 in the morning hitting one of my wonderful hair balls with a bare foot, nothing else is quite as good for a wakeup...unless I get lucky and kill a mouse and leave it there.....     Life can be fun with so llittle effort.<br />Big party Saturday night.  I am most curious but really am not wild about the people coming.  Hope they stay out of the house and up at the barn.  I prefer not to be bothered.  How do I know where they have had their nasty hands that they feel they need to stroke me with.  I mean really, people can do some pretty disgusting things and not everyone washes their hands.  I think they could at least lick them clean like I do my butt.  Which reminds me, I must kiss mommy.  She loves my kisses.<br />My favorite time of year...cool weather brings in the spiders.  I love to catch them and eat them.  I love to show them to mommy and her mommy.  Did you know that if you catch a big spider, hold it in your mouth but not kill it that its little legs will go all over your face.  For some reason showing that to mommy and her mommy really freaks them out.  They also prefer I just kill the spider instead of getting bored with it and letting it go.  People have strange ideas, I can always catch it another day and kill it then....whatever.<br />Well, time to move on, feel a need to torment the "boys" while they are kenneled for the day.  Poor "boys"...hah!  they should be caged all the time the little poop scarffers, butt-smellers, bug eating no nuts!  Heehee, they have no nuts.  They were all fixed.  Well, I still think they need more fixing because they certainly are not right.  They get to attend the party and beg food...I HATE THEM.  At least I can count on at least one of them getting stepped on.  Life is good.<br /><br />Until later...RATTY the GREAT!</div><br>

		<div class="content">My name is NOT Fatty Ratt, lardass, Blobus Americanus, FatRat, or Blobass!!  Yes, I am a matronly looking lady but hell, I am 9 years old and that is at least middle age for me.  The people here can be so cruel and unfeeling.  They have compared my figure when I sit to a pear or a bowling pin and mommy's mom laughs when I sit saying all the fat just sinks down around my ass!!!  Like she has any room to talk, nothing slim about her but her excuse is she is old, fat and tired and stressed, has raging hormones and everyone needs to get off her back.  Well, now she knows how I feel.  Yes, I do like a few extra POUNCES and yes, people food is great and I will eat it as much and often as I can, life isn't easy for me either.  I may not work for Corporate America, that unfeeling entity, but I have to live with three mutants, three stinking, yapping, digusting dachshunds!!!  You know, I was here long before any of them made their appearance and they have just tried to take over my home.  No wonder a girl like me has put on a few pounds and besides, I think the tip of my tail turning gray is quite becoming.....<br />But let us forget all this and talk about last week.  The gods must be angry with me, seems like there was no peace.  Mommy's mommy and daddy were home the whole week meaning the "boys" were loose in the house almost the whole week.  Only when outside work was being done did I get any peace at all.  Truly, my life was Hell!!!  Mommy's mommy and daddy and Beth the Brutal, who took vacation for 3 days, went to the fair.  Not sure what the fair is but they had fun.  They smelled like all sorts of animals, diesel fuel and strange food when they came home and they seemed happy.  Said something about the combine demolition derby being the greatest thing to watch, it made them laugh.  Hmmmm, destruction of big farm equipment makes them happy?  People are strange.  Mommy also took a couple days off but of course, she spent lots of her time with Mike.  I really like Mike, I just wish mommy would hug me as much as she hugs him.  I need brushed, which I hate, but really need right now but no, mommy is too busy with schoolwork, quilting, or Mike to give me the attention I need.  If she ever notices that I am hairier than usual perhaps she will brush me.  If not I can certainly yak up a hairball the size of Texas on her pillow.  That would get me brushed.  I had to take an extra smelly crap on the floor by my litter box yesterday since mommy forgot to clean my litter box.  She would scream if she had to use a dirty toilet and she doesn't even have to put her feet in the toilet like I do.  Well, I will lick my feet clean and then give mommy a kiss, litter box kisses are the best revenge 'cause she doesn't even realize what I am kissing her with!<br />What is with these stupid bugs that manage to invade my home.  They are nasty little things that taste bad and pinch.  I do not like them...the news said they are Asiatic Beetles...well I say send them back to Asia.  Be glad when we get killing frost and they are gone gone gone!!!<br />Halloween is approaching and the big party is to take place on the 25th.  Guess there will be a bonfire and a hayride.  I will sit and watch from the window, too many people and the outdoors is not fun for a pampered puss like me anyway.  I wish I had not been sheltered all my life, the food smells wonderful and I just know I could leap on the table and escape with something tasty.  Plus the night smells are fantastic, wood smoke, food, little animals in the leaves....yes, part of me wishes I had been born a lesser caste, one of the outdoor kitties, their lives seem so exciting, but then I stop and think, soft bed, air conditioning in the summer, warm warm heat in the winter, special begging for food opps that the outdoor kitties do not get, and most of all a litter box, they have to crap wherever they can find a spot.  Yes, I have the best.<br />Well, closing for now.  Will try to write more often but I am so busy being pampered that sometimes I just forget that I have an adoring audience.  Being a star is so hard.<br /><br />Until later!  Splotches, Spoiled Kitty....Ruler of All!!!!</div><br>

		<div class="content">It is really happening, they are planning a party.  A Halloween party on the 25th.  Why do I think this will be nothing but pain and suffering for me?<br /><br />Last night mommy's mommy came home with hats for the "boys" or so she says.  One is a spider hat and one is a witch hat.  She already has a pumpkin outfit and devil outfit for them.  Why does this concern me you may ask.  Those two stupid bitches, mommy's mommy and Beth the Brutal, seem to think it is funny to dress me up in those humilating outfits and take pictures.  I really really hate being dressed up to look like a pumpkin, devil or anything.  I am a dignified being, those outfits are demeaning.  I swear, if those two get the urge to do something stupid like that I will poop in their shoes, scratch their shoes, sit next to them and fart and while it will not hurt Beth the Brutal it really piss off mommy's mommy if I crap on the floor instead of the litter box.  Oh let those two evil women try to humilate me, revenge is always sweet.<br /><br />Wow, temperature drop!  Really I do not mind, great to curl up in or under a blanket or huddle in mommy's bed with her while she reads, however, this weather is making the monster mutts feel frisky.  The idiots run around the house, barking, chasing each other, CHASING ME AND BARKING AT ME, and that is the problem.  They refuse to accept my dominance, they cannot fathom that I, the Ratty Catt, am the supreme ruler of the house and all others are there only by my generosity.  Those lesser creatures should not ever think they can chase me.  So I must fight, I hiss and bat at them.  Would be a lot more effective if I hadn't been mutilated as a kitten.  You see, I have not front claws.  My mommy permitted, actually instructed, the vet to remove my reproductive organs (which is ok, never really wanted a family although a little sexual action would have been nice) and rip out my front claws.  Now I am not as effective fighter as I would have liked to be.  Still, I win, if nothing else, mommy steps in and screams at the rat-dogs to STOP CHASING HER!!!  Mommy almost looks possessed at those moments...I love it!<br /><br />Next week is county fair week.  Mommy's mommy, daddy and of course, Beth the Brutal just love the county fair and the combine demolition derby....whatever, they can be such rednecks.  Mommy is taking a quilting class so she cannot go or she would be there too, scarfing down greasy fries, munching on junk food galore and sitting in the stands cheering on people stupid enough to run big harvesters into each other.  Humans can be so strange.  Of course, I will be ignored, the dogs will eat my food and my stomach will growl and I will be forced to yowl and stomp around until my bowl is replenished and I am pacified by being given POUNCE, lots of POUNCE.  So next week should be interesting.<br /><br />Well, must close for now.  More updates to follow.  As always, Ratty the Ruler</div><br>
