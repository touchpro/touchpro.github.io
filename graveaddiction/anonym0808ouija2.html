On August 31, 2008 I received an e-mail from an anonymous website visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Bella and I talked on the ouija board last night and met some cool people. This morning we wanted to try it again. So we got it all set up and started talking.
<br><br>
Us: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What's your name?<br>
Board: (lots of different letters)<br>
<br>
Us: How old are you?<br>
Board: 91<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die?<br>
Board: Natural causes<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anything you would like to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is it?<br>
Board: Jeremoy<br>
<br>
*Jeremy was my friend's boyfriend who was shot one night. She had a long distance relationship with him. She never got to meet him, but the night he was going to leave to see her, he was shot.*
<br><br>
Us: Do you mean Jeremy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What about Jeremy?<br>
Board: nz nz nz (we did not know what that meant, but he keep saying it over and over)<br>
<br>
Us: May we talk to Jeremy?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Does Jeremy want to tell us something?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: May we please talk to Jeremy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is this Jeremy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
*I told Bella to ask the board something only the two of them would know*<br>
<br>
Us: What is Jeremy's middle name?<br>
Board: Curtis<br>
<br>
*that is right*<br>
<br>
Us: Were you shot?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Did you want to marry me? (my friend)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Am I making you sad?<br>
Board: No..<br>
<br>
Then he spelled out love you.<br>
<br>
Us: Should I move on?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Will you always be here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
*we had to get going because we had to go eat with the family*<br>
<br>
Us: We have to go. Can we talk to you again?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Can we talk to you tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Then we said goodbye and left.<br>
<br>
We were both in tears the whole time. As soon as he said Jeremy, we both started crying. It was so sad for the both of us. We are hoping we can talk to him again tonight.
<br><br>
I never really believed all this.<br><br>
Until now.
