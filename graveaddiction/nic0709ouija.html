On July 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Nic about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Nic, and I am 18 years old. I usually conduct my Ouija sessions with my sister, Kylie.
<br><br>
I'd like to start off by saying that we have had nothing but good experiences from using this board because of our usage of proper materials, and the excellent beginning and closing prayers that we took from this website. Although we have talked to many spirits during our nine sessions so far, there is one spirit in particular that continues to give us memorable Ouija experiences.
<br><br>
It all began when we first used the board. At first we contacted our late grandmother and other family members. After doing so, we asked if there were any other spirits that we did not know. Here is a short excerpt from the beginning of our conversation with this &quot;new&quot; spirit:
<br><br>
Kylie: Could you tell us your name?<br>
Board: Sam<br>
<br>
Nic: Is there anything you wanted to tell us?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Kylie: You wanted to tell us you are turning 4?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
My sister and I thought it was quite funny that Sam still held onto the typical childhood innocence even after passing. The fact that he only wanted to contact us to tell us he was turning 4 made my sister and I laugh. Since then, we continued to talk to Sam on a regular basis, and I guess you could say we built up some sort of human-spirit relationship. He never fails to pull several jokes during each session. Here's one of his favorites that he loves to pull:
<br><br>
Nic: Are there any other spirits that would like to speak with us?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Kylie: Can we speak with them?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Nic: Thanks, is this a spirit we have not spoken with?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kylie: Could you tell us your name?<br>
Board: Sam<br>
<br>
*laughter ensues*<br>
<br>
He likes to pull this almost every time we ask to speak with another spirit. It's safe to say that Sam is quite the board hog! After he pulls his jokes and makes us laugh, his typical reaction is to move the planchette back and forth between the sun and a nearby open space. This is because we told him to show us his laughter by doing just that.<br>
<br>
From time to time we ask Sam to tell us a joke. Here is his typical response:<br>
<br>
Nic: Sam could you tell us a joke?<br>
Sam: Stupidk<br>
<br>
Kylie: Are you calling me stupid?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Nic: Are you just joking?<br>
Sam: Yes *movement back and forth to the sun*<br>
<br>
As you can see, Sam loves to kid with anyone who's willing to speak with him, but he also likes to make personal attachments. My sister had her friend Meghan over during one session. During that session, as we expected, Sam stepped up to the board again. Here is a short summary of what happened:<br>
<br>
Kylie: Is this Sam?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Nic: Can you say hi to Meghan?<br>
Sam: Hi<br>
<br>
Kylie: Do you want to say something to Meghan?<br>
Sam: Love<br>
<br>
Nic: You love her?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Meghan: Thanks *blush*<br>
Sam: YW (Your Welcome)<br>
<br>
Nic: Is there anything else you would like to say to her?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
Kylie: What?<br>
Sam: Sexy<br>
<br>
Nic: You think Meghan is sexy?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
*laughter*<br>
<br>
Although he really loved Meghan, he quickly changed his mind once she told him that she only wanted to be friends. Now he likes my sister!<br>
<br>
As we continue with our Ouija sessions, we will gladly keep you updated on Sam's antics as well as any other new spirits that we encounter. We find that Sam will constantly give readers a good laugh.<br>
<br>
I would like to conclude with a message to anyone who uses the Ouija board and anyone who cares to read this story. Most bad occurrences happen when people misuse the board, such as not beginning with a proper prayer, forgetting proper materials, or not closing the board properly. My sister and I use the prayers from this website under the Tips section to both open and close the board. We use a white candle, along with a bowl of water (said to transfer more energy because of its symbolism for life), a couple of flowers (for more life energy) when we can find them, and religious items for protection. Because of this, like I said earlier, we have had nothing but good experiences with our board and have encountered only good spirits. We can't stress enough how important respect is. No one wants to have their time wasted, spirit or not, so show respect. If you run into trouble for any reason, I would suggest the prayer to Michael the Archangel, asking for him to stand guard against any unwanted spirits.<br>
<br>
Most of all, be responsible and know what you're doing before getting into it. You wouldn't get on the highway without knowing how to drive a car, would you?<br>
<br>
Nic: Is there anything you would like to say to the readers when we tell them about you?<br>
Sam: Stupid<br>
<br>
Kylie: You want us to tell them they're stupid?<br>
Sam: Yes<br>
<br>
