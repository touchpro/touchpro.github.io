On July 6, 2008 I received an e-mail from Lisa Q. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Lisa, and I'm 37 now.  I still get freaked out about an experience my ex-husband (boyfriend at the time) and I had with an Ouija board when we were 18 years old.
<br><br>
My boyfriend, Trevor, and I first received an Ouija board from my sister's friend. This Ouija board, per our friend Kathy, had been passed around a lot and was cursed. There was a &quot;x&quot; etched across the board. Kathy had told me that if the board goes to the letter x, that's a bad spirit. She also told us that we should light a candle, and if the flame flickers there is a bad spirit in the room. She explained how one of the owners got rid of the board, only to find it again under his bed. Also, a story about how she was driving with her friends and her hatch flew open and a black cat jumped out of the car. Of course I was freaked out, but at the same time I was like no way.
<br><br>
So later Trevor and I went to a friend's house. She bought a new board from Toys 'R Us. We lit a candle, and my girlfriend and I did the board together. I did the talking. I asked it various questions. It told me I would marry Trevor, whom I did marry that same year.  There was a spirit named Abe; he was 10 when he had died, and he knew my mother's name.  At one point the candle started flickering and Abe kept going to goodbye. We ended our session. This is where it gets really freaky.
<br><br>
Trevor and I went home, and the two cats my parents had were acting weird.  The house seemed grey inside. We took out the board, sat in two chairs with our knees touching, and put the board across our laps. I put what I've always called the cursor on the board, and the cursor tilted up off its front leg and slid across the board with no one touching it.  We dropped the board and said some major profanity. I said, no, let's do this.  We put our hands on the cursor, and asked if Abe, the spirit I talked to earlier, was still there. It kept saying no. It went to x, to 6, back to 6, and then back to 6 again. I said I wasn't afraid of it, and that I could fight it. It spelled out die. Then the last thing, that was the icing on the cake for me, was it spelled out immortal.  I told Trevor we needed to leave the house. We were going to stay with Kathy, the girl who gave us the board. I didn't want to leave the board in my parents' house, so we dropped it in a dumpster at the bottom of the hill at a store. While we were spending the night at Kathy's house, we couldn't sleep. We turned the TV on. I kid you not, every freaky channel we turned to was something about the devil or psychic hot line, or TV priests talking about the Devil. The next day I explained to my parents where we went and why. My mom was yeah, like that would really happen.  I asked my mom about Abe, and she said she knew a guy named Abe who had a son also named Abe that did die when he was a child.  She had Trevor go and get the board from the dumpster. She and I tried it, nothing happened. They say if you're not open minded or skeptical, it won't work. My mom suggested that my dad burn it since I was so freaked out. Trevor and my dad poured gasoline on it and lit it. The flames shot up 6 feet in the air. After it burned, the only piece that remained was the corner of the dark side.   For years after that, I felt like demons were around me. Scary S--T!!
