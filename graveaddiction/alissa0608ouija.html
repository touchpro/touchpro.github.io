On June 17, 2008 I received an e-mail from Alissa F. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This was my last experience, and I have not touched a board since. I did not write the conversation down, but remember enough of it.
<br><br>
It is about my ex, who was pretty much a psycho whp would tell me about everything going shitty for him.  So I've always thought he would kill himself.
<br><br>
I was at this guy's house one night, who I had been seeing, and we decided to use the board.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone who would like to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Could you tell us your name please?<br>
Board: (spells out my ex's name)<br>
<br>
Me: **** who?<br>
Board: (spells out ex's full name)<br>
<br>
Me: Whatever, this isn't you...ok then, what kind of car do you have?<br>
Board: Skyline (this is right)<br>
<br>
Me: What's your mum's address?<br>
Board: (writes out correct address)<br>
<br>
Board: O.D  O.D O.D  (as in over dose)<br>
<br>
*by now I was seriously freaked out, and at some point now I was crying*
<br><br>
I asked a few more questions, then went to bed. I woke up in the morning, unable to forget what had happened.  So I went back on the board.
<br><br>
Me: Are you there ****?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Board: I'm sorry<br>
Board: I love you<br>
<br>
Me: (crying) You idiot, why did you do that?!!!!!<br>
Board: I'm sorry<br>
<br>
Board: I love you like I always did.<br>
(this was something he had also said to me in person when we had had a fight before)<br>
<br>
At one point, we had talked about baby names and I remember him telling me a name that he liked.  I would not have remembered this name again if I hadn't heard it. The next thing that he said freaked me out.
<br><br>
Board: Call my baby **** (the name he had said before)
<br><br>
I was a mess at this point, so I got the guy I was with to call my ex's phone.  He answered and was fine. He didn't know who it was calling or anything.
<br><br>
So I have no idea who was messing with my head or how they knew this stuff.  It was not me moving it, because there no way I could have thought of the name otherwise...it's not a common name that you would remember.
<br><br>
If anyone has any idea, please contact me. =)
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or information for Alissa, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on to her.
