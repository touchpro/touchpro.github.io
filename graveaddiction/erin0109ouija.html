On January 5, 2009 I received an e-mail from Erin Renee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I made the ouija board about a couple months ago so my friend Renee and I could play it. I took a piece of wood and drew the ouija board stuff on it, like the letters and whatever. So we played it a lot, and nothing really serious happend. Then I played it with my brother one night, and we were in my room.  The light switch went off while we where playing, so I was just like ok, that's kinda freeky but whatver. So I played it again with my brother latter that week, and him being stupid asked the spirit to put out a candle.  It wouldn't do it. Also, a bad thing was we used six red candles.
<br><br>
Later that week my friend Melissa came over, and we played it but nothing happened at all. I think it only happens with some people. So Melissa and I went to Renee's house down the street. We were playing in her room, and we kept hearing tapping by the window. There was a desk and a chair right there. So we kept on playing, and we heard a little scream by the window behind me. I got the chills, and we all looked at each other, screamed, and tackled each other to get out of the room. Then we went to my house and played it a while.  Only one candle went out, but we never asked it to. Then I stopped playing it.
<br><br>
Today i got in the mood to play it with my friend Brett. We played it, and nothing happened at all. Throughout the whole time I've played it, the ghosts have said they don't like my brother. My brother has seen things at night. I was kinda scared for him. So tonight Brett and I were taking pictures in my room to see if we could see anything like spirits. I took this one picture towards my mirror, and I zoomed in under the bed and there was a face under my bed staring at me. I showed Brett, and we both freaked out. So we just went on my laptop. Then my brother came in all scared and asked me to go in his room. I looked at him, and he was shaking. He told me that he was standing right by his closet, and felt  something choke him. I looked at him, and he was serious. My brother's almost 18, and I don't think he would joke around with it. He had red marks on his neck. I went back in my room, and he called me in again.  He was looking at a picture of evil or something like that, and he saw the devil star or some kind of star.  He pointed in his closet where he got choked, and one hanger was kinda tilted.  I looked at the shadow on the wall, and it was the same star we saw in the picture. Normally i would just be like whatever, but he got choked and we read that if you get choked its a poltergeist. So I'm going to get rid of the ouija board. Please be careful for your own good. I know I'm not going to play this game again.
