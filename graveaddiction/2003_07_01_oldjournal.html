I didn't get a chance to blog yesterday, I was too busy cleaning!  I'm all done though, so now I won't have to worry about cleaning this weekend.  I would have finished sooner, but when I got home I fell asleep for about an hour and a half while watching the local news.  I rarely fall asleep during the day like that, I must have been really tired.<br /><br />Last night the power went out around 2AM.  I'm lucky I had my fan turned on (I still like using fans even though the AC is on, it helps circulate the air), or I'd probably still be sleeping.  When I woke up last night and looked at the clock and saw that it said 12:01AM I knew the power must have been out since I knew it was later than that.  I think the fan switching back on is what caused me to wake up.  I noticed that a lot of cars that are usually gone in the complex's parking lot were still there this morning...bet those people weren't as lucky as me and didn't wake up after the electricity came back on.  <br /><br />I also did my laundry last night.  I always carry it to the laundry room in those big mesh bags.  When it was all clean and dried last night I carried it back to my apartment and threw the bags in the middle of my bed and started to fold it as usual.  Remember, I said I threw those big bags on clothes in the middle of my flat bed....while I was folding, one of the bags quickly slid (or was pulled) onto the floor!  It really startled me because it moved FAST!  Since the bed is flat I don't know how it could slide off like that.  It's not like the weight of the be caused the matress to become slanted.  Maybe if part of the bag had been hanging off the edge or was even close to the edge I could see that happening.  I just can't figure it out.  I was taking my time with folding the clothes, maybe one of my &quot;roommates&quot;, AKA ghosts, pulled it off?  Who knows.<br><br>

My friend Mark really is a dedicated OSU football fan.  Why do I say this?  Today I sent him and another friend info about the 2nd Annual Mothman festival that's coming up on September 13.  I didn't hear about it in time last year, so I definitely don't want to miss it this year!  I asked if he'd want to ride down to the festival with me since he's a big Mothman fan too.  Plus he always rides down to Point Pleasant, WV with me to explore the <a href="tnt.html">TNT Area</a>.  However, I did realize that September 13 is a Saturday during Ohio State's football season, and I know Mark always watches their games.  Even Mothman won't tear him away from his TV on game day...but here's our tentative plan:<br /><blockquote><br />&quot;I could ride down with you.<br />You could drop me off at Mom and Dad's.<br />You could go to the Mothman festivities while I watch the game.<br />I could meet you in Point Pleasant after the game and join you for the<br />hayride.<br />You could follow me back to Mom and Dad's to drop off their vehicle.<br />I ride back to Columbus with you.&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />I told him that just might work!  But I still think he's crazy for putting football before a festival dedicated to an unsolved mystery.  Oh well.  <br /><br />Speaking of big OSU fans, I think I saw the grave of one of the school's biggest fans...here's one of the interesting gravestones I found on this past weekend's explorations in Fairfield County:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/buckgrave.jpg"></center><br /><br />I can't imagine having &quot;Go <i>any sports team</i>&quot; carved on my gravestone when I die.  But that's just me.  I'll be posting the rest of the cemetery photos I took last weekend on the site later this week.<br /><br />My day a work was pretty uneventful.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though!<br /><br />I can't think of anything else to blog about, so I guess I'll just wait and post more tomorrow!<br /><br><br>

Another weekend without blogging...I need to get better at that.  <br /><br />My Monday morning started out just <i>wonderful</i>...I got the &quot;blue screen of death&quot;.  I honestly wasn't surprised though, I knew it was coming.  The fact that I got about five error messages every morning and my computer wouldn't shut down at night kinda let me know something was wrong.  That had been going on for almost two months, I was actually relieved that this &quot;slow death march&quot; (a quote from Pat) is over!  Obviously I had to call CTS (Client Technical Services - our tech support group) to get my PC fixed.  Usually it takes them 2-4 days to fix these errors since they're so understaffed, but I had my computer back by 11AM this morning.  I couldn't believe I had it back in only three hours, so I tested everything to make sure it worked.  And not only do all of the applications I need work, but he was able to recover all of the documents, screensavers, archives, etc that I had saved on it!  Now I'm able to shut down my computer and I no longer receive any error messages when I log on.  I'm so happy!  Now all I have to do is contact someone to install QuickTest Pro, and Pat has already said he'll stop by later this week to install the Orthogonal Array tool he developed.  <br /><br />While my computer was being fixed, I logged on and worked from Kitty's desk (since she's on vacation all week).  Even though it feels weird to work at someone else's desk, I have to admit that I loved the aisle she sits in.  It's soooooooo much cooler than the one my desk is in.  Honestly, it's probably a ten degree difference in temperature between the two.  I also had fun sitting next to Michelle again.  I forgot that she sometimes talks out loud when she's working :)  <br /><br />Nothing else too exciting happened today.  My day really wasn't that bad, but it's almost like my mom and I switched places...her day really sucked.  Some of her coworkers sound even worse than some of my worst ones!<br /><br />My weekend went OK too.  On Saturday I went to the Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market again, but didn't find anything exciting.  It was still fun, even though it was terribly humid.  After that I had lunch with my sister and went to Best Buy with her.  I was so proud that she bought Disturbed and Linkin Park's most recent CD's.  However, I was very disappointed that she also bought a Keith Urban CD! :)  <br /><br />After Best Buy I went to a couple cemeteries in Fairfield County, both in Madison Township.  I saw some interesting gravestones, I'll probably add them to the site later this week.  That reminds me...I did add three new pages of pictures to the site...<a href="newstuff.html">click here</a> to see them.  I've also heard from a bunch of people who want to go on a group exploration.  The majority of the people want to visit the <a href="tnt.html">TNT Area</a> and <a href="lakin.html">Lakin State Hospital</a> in Point Pleasant, WV.  I've been wanting to take a trip down there again, looks like now I have an excuse!!  <br /><br />Well, I need to go and change some of the water in the fish tank.  I'm sure no one else would notice (they never seem to), but I think it's starting to smell a little bit again.  I love the cichlids, but I think they're a little messy.  Since my friend Amanda is coming over to use the ouija board with me on Thursday I want to make sure it's clean.  Yes, I'm a bit obsessive compulsive about things like that.<br /><br />Speaking of the ouija board, I just realized that I forgot to blog about what happened last Thursday.  Last Thursday evening I made a trip to the <a href="lpenna.html">Little Pennsylvania Cemetery</a> in Darbydale.  I got home around 9PM.  I wasn't expecting anything, but when I walked into my living room all of the junk on my coffee table was on the floor, and the ouija board that was sitting on my kitchen table was laying in the middle of the coffee table!!!  I have absolutely NO idea how it got there, no one had been in my apartment.  Very, very, very strange stuff.  I quickly put the board back on the table and put the books, remotes, etc back on the coffee table.  Then I turned off the living room light and spent the rest of the night in my bedroom!!  There was no way I was going to be in the room with the board after that happened! :)  I took this as a sign that it's time we have another &quot;contacting the dead&quot; party!  I'll be sure to let you know that happens.  I'm going to try out the new recorder this time too, so maybe I'll be able to put an MP3 or WAV file of our party out on the page along with the written transcript.<br /><br />OK, now I have to go and clean the fish tank...I can't wait (said sarcastically of course)!<br><br>

Ugh, sometimes I get so frustrated with my webhosting company.  My site didn't completely go down, but my e-mail, FTP, and MySQL database were down ALL morning.  I didn't hear from customer support for over four hours.  This is all they had to say:<br /><blockquote><br />&quot;One of the users on the server was using an inefficient PHP code which was not disconnecting from the MySQL server properly.  As a result you may have received the 'too many mysql connections' error, intermittently.  We have suspended this user from the server at this time.  Please let us know if you should encounter any other issues.  We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation.&quot;<br /></blockquote><br /><i>Intermittently</i>?????  Whatever, I checked at least once every half hour and it was down each time.  And what was up with the my e-mail being down?  Hopefully I received everything that was sent to me, I'll be pissed if some of my e-mails were lost.  If you did e-mail me and haven't received a response, I probably didn't get your e-mail.  Sorry about that!<br /><br />Other than the site problems, the rest of my day has been going pretty good.  I almost called off work, when I woke up and looked in the mirror the top of my head was white...I hate sunburns and peeling!  Luckily I got the peeling skin under control so I could go to work.  Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't say that makes me lucky...it's a nice day, I'd love to be outside right now enjoying it!  Oh well.<br /><br />This morning a bunch of us were talking about my site and explorations at my desk, which somehow led into a conversation about all of the murders that have taken place near OSU's campus.  There's some scary things going on around there.  But I wonder why conversations about death and stuff always have to happen at my desk?  I must bring out the dark, morbid, gloomy side of people :)  Of course, what else could you expect from someone who has a site called &quot;Grave Addiction&quot;, right?!?!?!?<br><br>

First, let me say this: Oh my god, I took a quiz that didn't make me sound like a mean, evil, depressing person!  I thought for sure I'd end up with results like black or gray!<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/B/blackcat000/1044164590_ral_result.jpg" border="0" alt="YOu see the world in Neutral"><br>Neutral:<br />Harmony and balance is key. You don't look at the<br>world in a negative or positive way and you'll<br>never judge or assume a situation- you just<br>look at the facts.

I am very thankful for that!<br /><br />My day at work went really fast today, I had a lot of unexpected things come up.  Like requesting TestDirector user IDs for some of the programmers, helping with a strange TestDirector error that Oliver was getting, and updating the production problem pager rotation schedule.  Updating the pager schedule was the most stressful thing, and that wasn't even really stressful...just confusing.  Six of us ended up switching our rotation dates, but it was confusing to figure out who was switching dates with who!  But I got it all worked out.  It worked out really good for me.  I switched, so now I have the pager for two weeks beginning next Thursday rather than getting stuck with it over labor day.  I'm taking some vacation around that time, so I needed to find someone to switch with anyway.  I love it when things work out like that.<br /><br />I went to lunch with Brenda...we had pizza, and according to the link in <a href="http://graveaddiction.com/blogtronics/" target="_blank">Erik's blog</a> that was a good choice.  Studies show that pizza may prevent some kinds of cancer.  Anyway, we had a fun lunch.  We gossiped about things going on at work, and Brenda feels the same as me about a lot of the stuff going on.  It's good to know that other people, especially ones that I wouldn't have guessed, feel as frustrated as me.  I'm still hoping that working on automated testing will help me get out of this feeling of being stuck.  Right now I keep getting pulled away from the automated stuff, but pretty soon a couple of us should be dedicated to that effort 100%.  I can't wait!<br /><br />Tonight I decided to make ice cream.  I need to invite people over to eat it though...I love ice cream, but it makes me sick.  I'm lactose intolerate, so making ice cream isn't a very smart thing for me to do.  I just have so much fun experimenting with things in the kitchen though.  Tonight I decided to make coconut flavored ice cream, since I just love coconut.  I used the vanilla ice cream recipe, but used only one teaspoon of vanilla extract and two teaspoons of coconut extract.  So the recipe wasn't very different.  However, for some reason the mixture really expanded while it was freezing, and I got coconut ice cream all over the counter and myself....I smell like a big coconut right now!  Almost smells like suntan lotion, so at least it's not a terrible thing to smell like!  Anyway, I tried a little spoonful, and it tastes heavenly.  I'd love to eat a big bowl of it, but I know it'd make me sick for the rest of the night!<br /><br />Other than that, I didn't do anything else interesting tonight.  I really want to do things outside, but I don't think it'll ever stop raining here in Ohio!  <br><br>

For those of you who are interested in going on a group exploration with me, I added an "interest form" to the site - <a href="explore.html">Click here to see it</a>. <br /><br />It's been a busy day, I'll blog again later this evening.<br><br>

Today was a really slow day, I was so thankful when the work day was over.  It really wasn't a terrible day, it just wasn't a good one.  Nothing fun happened, so I don't really have much to say about my day.  <br /><br />I worked on the CDs I'm making for the Summer Swap It! thing tonight...I should have them ready to mail out by the weekend.  This isn't a very modest comment, but I think the CDs I'm making for my group are awesome!  Not as good as the &quot;stress relief&quot; CDs I made Chrissie, but pretty damn close.  I wasn't planning to keep a copy of the CDs for myself, but I think I will since I like them so much.<br /><br /><br />I also printed out some business cards with my e-mail address and web address on them.  That way when people ask for my site I won't have to write http://www.graveaddiction.com, I can just give them a card.  They aren't very fancy, but they'll do just fine.  <br /><br />Speaking of the website, I should have another update later this week.  Also, a couple people have mentioned wanting to get a web group together to go exploring sometime.  I think that sounds like fun, so I'll be creating a form to see how many people are interested in going to a cemetery or something with me.  If any of you are interested, let me know....but Erik, you'd probably be the only person since you're the only one who lives in Central Ohio :)  Oh yeah, and Chrissie, Susan, and Michelle (who also read this regularly) you're invited too, of course!!  Anyway, I'm not sure when or where we'll explore, those questions will be part of the form.  I hope people don't think I'm trying to be like the Ohio Exploration Society, I'm not planning to turn Grave Addiction into a group site.  It'll be still be mine, all mine, bwhahahahahahaha.  But really, I don't see any harm having new people who are interested in the same stuff coming along with me sometimes.  And as always, I'll still thank everyone who explores with me or contributes photos on the site's <a href="credits.html">Thank You page</a> and the page where the photos of that exploration are.  This could be lots of fun, and the only way to know for sure is to give it a try!<br /><br><br>

hahahahahahaha, someone found my blog looking for &quot;sleeping with satan&quot;!!  I don't think I've ever written about that, sorry!<br /><br />Anyway, here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="_blank">This-or-That</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>DVD or VHS?</b><br>DVD, even though most of the movies I own are VHS since I just got my DVD player this past December.<br /><li><b>Best Literary/Movie Villan: Voldemort (Harry Potter) or Sauron (LoTR)?</b><br>Sauron, I'm really not into the whole Harry Potter craze.<br /><li><b>Meat: rare or well-done?</b><br>Definitely well-done.  I don't like eating a dinner that bleeds!  I don't like meat charred or burnt, but I don't want to see any red or pink...yuck!  Also, with all of the possible diseases that one can get as a result of eating undercooked meat, why chance it?<br /><li><b>High Speed Internet-Cable or DSL?</b><br>Cable.  Of course, I just use dial-up at home since I don't do much surfing or downloading.<br /><li><b>Women: 1-piece bathing suit or Bikini?</b><br>1-piece bathing suit<br /><li><b>To be fair--Men: Boxers or briefs?</b><br>N/A<br /><li><b>Beer or Liquor/Wine?</b><br>Liquor, I can tolerate beer but I'm not a big fan of wine.<br /><li><b>Coke or Mountain Dew?</b><br><i>Diet</i> Coke.  That's what my mom always drank, so that's what I got used to.  Regular Coke tastes funny to me.<br /><li><b>In honor of my 10/18/03 nuptials: Morning or Afternoon/Night Wedding?</b><br>I've never been to a night wedding, but I think that sounds pretty cool!<br /><li><b>Carpet or Hardwood Floors?</b><br>Hardwood.  I think they look nicer, plus I hate vacuuming (since I always suck up things that I shouldn't, like extension cords!) so sweeping is much better.<br /><li><b>American cars or foreign?</b><br>I drive a Chevy truck, GMC or Chevy trucks are the best!  If I drove a car though, I might consider a foreign one, they have really good reputations.<br /><li><b>Cutest TV Twin: Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen?</b><br>They're twins, don't they look alike?<br /><li><b>Coffee: Caffeinated or Decaf?</b><br>I HATE coffee!  I don't even like the smell of it!<br /><li><b>Thought-Provoking Question of the Week: Computers: Do they make life better or worse? Why?</b><br>That's a tough one, I've heard good arguments for both opinions.  Personally, I think they make life better.  I've been able to &quot;meet&quot; a lot of people from all over the world that I probably wouldn't have if it wasn't for computers.  I think that alone makes them wonderful!  Plus they help in a lot of job functions, which is probably the best reason to have them around!<br /></ol><br /><br />My face is starting to peel today.  Thank god I have plenty of lotion at my desk!<br><br>

So much for waiting until tonight to blog :)  I'll write a short post now...<br /><br />This past Saturday I went to the <a href="http://www.summersanitarium.net/" target="_blank">Summer Sanitarium tour</a> at Ohio Stadium!  It was one of the best concerts I've ever been too, all of the bands were awesome.  We got there around 2, which was an hour before the first band, <a href="http://www.mudvayne.com" target="_blank">Mudvayne</a>, started.  I love Mudvayne, I wish they could have played longer!  I had seen all of the bands before, with the exception of <a href="http://www.deftones.com" target="_blank">The Deftones</a>.  Anyway, the sun didn't set until 9-ish...which means I was sitting out in the sun for about 7 hours.  Needless to say, I have a terrible sunburn!  And a <i>really</i> bad farmer's tan :)  I'll have to take a picture of the watch mark on my wrist and post it here tonight.  Even though the sunburn kind of hurts, the pain is not the worst part...the worst part is knowing that maybe as early as tomorrow I'll start to peel!  I hate having clumps of dry skin all over my face, it looks like I have leprosy or something.  And it's even worse when the top of my head peels, then it looks like I have big dandruff flakes.  Oh well, the concert was worth it!<br /><br />The concert pretty much took up my whole weekend.  Yesterday I slept in.  Then I went to Petsmart to get some crickets and feeder fish for the frogs.  I was also out of calcium powder to dust the crickets with, so I had to get that too.  When I opened the calcium powder I managed to spill it all over the black t-shirt I was wearing.  I wasn't too thrilled about that, calcium powder smells pretty bad!  <br /><br />After I changed my shirt I drove over to the <a href="tico.html">TICO Cemetery</a> to get some more pictures.  I just found out last week that across the road from the bigger gravestones there are hundreds of small, flat gravestones that are simply marked with a M or F followed by a number.  The gravestones are about the same size as a brick.  It's really sad that those people are just referred to as &quot;Male 49583&quot;, etc.  It does make the cemetery seem even creepier though.  I'm hoping to get the four or five photos I took of those graves added to the site tonight.<br><br>

Just more proof that there are some sick people out there...<br /><br />John just sent me the link to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3075897.stm" target="_blank">this article</a> about a man in Germany who was charged with murder.  He put out a personal ad looking for a guy to kill.  So someone answered the ad, gave him permission to stab him to death.  Then they guy ate some of the body parts and froze the rest.  They have the whole thing on tape.  Not sure who is worse, the cannibal or the person who answered the ad!<br /><br /><br><br>

Here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>When was the last time you cheated?</b><br>I'm sure it's happened since then in some form, but the last time I remember cheating was my senior year of high school.  We had a horrible Advanced Bio teacher the second half of the year, and I was worried that I'd fail.  So Jimmy, one of my lab partners, decided to do something about it.  He had a friend who had a copy of the janitor's keys (I'm really not lying!) and they stole a copies of the tests while she was at lunch.  Then a group of us would get together in the gym after we ate our lunches and we'd look up the answers.  I was responsible for keeping the cheat sheet since the teacher wouldn't suspect me of cheating.  Then I'd write big so Jimmy and Jeff, my other lab partner, could read the answers.  Then the people next to them would copy from their tests, etc.  I think the only people not in on our little &quot;cheating circle&quot; were the teacher and the people in the front row!  I guess I still feel a little guilty, but hey, there aren't many people who can say they never cheated in high school.  So I don't feel too bad!<br /><li><b>When was the last time you stole?</b><br>I've probably taken a pen from work home with me on accident.  Oh, and maybe a binder clip or too.  I honestly don't mean to take them, and they always end up back at work.<br /><li><b>When was the last time you lied?</b><br>hahaha, yesterday morning when someone asked me how my day was going and I replied &quot;just wonderful&quot;.  <br /><li><b>When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?</b><br>I have never vandalized someone else's property.  I don't even break or vandalize things when I go into rundown, abandoned places!<br /><li><b>When was the last time you hurt a loved one?</b><br>I can't remember the last time, but I'm sure I probably have.<br /></ol><br /><br><br>

Ugh, the first non-work related e-mail that I read today was already bad.  Chrissie, who somehow ended up on the <a href="http://www.afa.net/" target="_blank">American Family Association</a> newletter, included me on the list of people she forwarded their latest e-mail to.  First, let me say that I <b>really</b> dislike the AFA.  I think their goal to turn America into a bunch of good God fearin' Christians is ridiculous.  I'm against just about everything they're for.  I'm not Christian, I'm pro-choice, and I also disagree with the topic of the e-mail Chrissie sent: <a href="http://www.nogaymarriage.com/" "target=_blank">banning homosexual marriages</a>.  Even though I'm not a homosexual, I don't think there's anything wrong with allowing two guys or two girls to get married.  I have some gay friends who have been with their partners for several years, they're practically married...and their relationships are a lot healthier than those of some straight people I know.  And I don't think using the Bible is a good enough excuse to ban homosexual marriages.  I guess I just don't understand how people can be so narrowminded.  Thank god Chrissie also included <a href="http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/marriage_amendment_oppose" target="_blank">a link</a> to oppose HJR56.  <br /><br />Hahaha, I just got another e-mail from Chrissie...she just unsubscribed to the AFA's mailing list (she doesn't know how she got on it in the first place).  Good for her!!<br><br>

I ended up staying late at work.  Not one of my favorite things to do, but at least I was helping someone who really appreciated it and would do the same for me.  Anyway, I'm not feeling tired at all, my mind is saying &quot;hey, you've only been home for a few hours, you need to stay up!&quot; while my body is saying &quot;I'm TIRED!!!!!&quot;.  I didn't get anything done at home that I wanted to.  Oh well.  <br /><br />Well, since I don't want to get into details about the stuff I was working on (you'd be bored after two seconds of reading, believe me!), I guess I'll log off and blog more tomorrow.<br /><br />I leave you with the results to a quiz I took a few minutes ago:<br /><center><br /><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/P/pressthebigredbutton/1055172784_CRussellquizatheist.jpg" border="0" alt="Atheist"><br>Threat rating: extremely low.

Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts...lots of exciting things coming up!<br /><br />First, I got a call from Chrissie last night.  She and Susan got dinner reservations at the haunted Buxton Inn (in Granville, OH) for October 31st...and I'm invited!  That should be fun.  They're also going to try to get reservations for a haunted hotel room so we can use the Ouija board in it.  <br /><br />My second exciting ghost related thing (and the MOST exciting) is August 8th...Linda, a friend I worked with on Project FOCUS, invited me to go on an all-night ghost hunt at the old Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.  This is the prison where the Shawshank Redemption was filmed.  It's also famous for all of the paranormal activity that goes on there.  It's not cheap, but all proceeds go to the restoration fund, plus you get to wander the building from 8PM until dawn the next day!  I really can't wait, this is going to be so much fun!  You can read more about the building and the ghost hunts by <a href="http://www.mrps.org/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />And as always, the ghostly activity is still going on in my apartment.  I'm used to having things moved around and lined up all over the apartment now! :)<br><br>

It's always the little things that drive me crazy...last Friday when I was down at my parents' place I was walking around their yard barefoot (even though I like wearing unusual socks and shoes, going barefoot is even better!).  Not a very bright thing for me to do after all of the rain we just had.  I have mosquito bites all over the top of my feet.  Well, actually there are only four.  The smallest bite is the one that is bothering me the most.  It's on the top of my right foot, and when I put my shoes on they rub against the bite.  That makes it itch even more!  I've probably looked really silly at work this week, I find myself using the bottom of my left foot to rub the top of the right foot in a desperate attempt to scratch it.  I thought that would be less noticeable than me reaching down to scratch it with my hand.  It probably isn't though.  And unfortunately there's not a good way to scratch it since it's difficult to reach under the shoe...oh well, that's probably good since scratching it is just going to make it worse.  Hopefully it'll go away soon.<br /><br />Today was an OK day at work.  I did have a scare though.  I printed a design document so I could use it to start writing my test plans.  When I came back to my desk from the printer I had the &quot;BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH&quot;!!!  I hit the power button, and when I restarted it my PC was fine.  Oh, and I always assume that people know what the blue screen of death is, but a few of my friends told me that just because I'm a computer geek and know what that is, it doesn't mean they know.  Basically it's a fatal error message, and the screen turns blue and there's all this white code on the screen.  I was lucky that it restarted today, but I have a terrible feeling that this is a sign telling me that my computer is getting ready to crash.  Quite a few people in my area have been getting the BSD lately, a couple of people have had the motherboards on the computer replaced so many times just this year that our managers broke down and ordered new computers for them.  I wonder if we have some kind of virus in a commonly used document or something, there must be some reason that all of the computers have been acting up.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.brianslife.net/" target="_blank">Brian's blog</a> is awesome...I find so many interesting links there!  People in Michigan must have a talent for finding interesting sites, because <a href="http://www.greengrl.org" target="_blank">Bonnie's blog</a> has just as many cool things.  Anyway, Brian mentioned a <a href="http://www.neuroticfishbowl.com/archives/002311.html" target="_blank">CD Swap</a> that he is going to participate in.  I visited the link and decided to sign up too, it sounds like fun!  However, I was a little worried at first because the theme is &quot;songs that make you hot&quot;...like &quot;make-out&quot; or love songs.  Those of you who know the music I listen to are probably thinking &quot;how is Beth going to make a CD with songs like that&quot;?  I know you're thinking that because that's what all my coworkers said :)  They all started guessing songs that I might include, such as <i>Closer</i> by Nine Inch Nails or <i>Control</i> by Puddle of Mudd.  They were all shocked though when I said that while I thought a CD with songs like that would be the coolest, I was planning to put &quot;real&quot; love songs on it.  I have bunches of 80's and classic rock CDs, plus some of the &quot;lighter&quot; bands like Our Lady Peace, Creed, Lifehouse, etc that I listen to have appropriate songs.  I went through some of my CDs tonight, and I've already listed 54 songs that I can choose from.  I did refuse Lina's Kenny G suggestion though :)  I think it'll be lots of fun! <br><br>

As usual, I didn't blog this weekend.  I was just too busy!<br /><br />I ended up taking a half day off work on Friday, it was just too nice outside!  So after my monthly one-on-one meeting with Ben (my manager) I ran out of the building!  No, I didn't run away because my meeting was bad, I just couldn't wait to get outside :)  In fact, my meeting went pretty good.  Instead of the normal conversation that goes &quot;Do you have anything to talk about&quot; and me replying with a &quot;no&quot;, we actually talked.  Mainly about the automated testing stuff, but also about the new job titles that are rolling out at the beginning on 2004.  It was a good conversation.<br /><br />After I left, I drove down to Amanda to check out a couple cemeteries there.  I only got to visit two of the three I wanted to though, one of the roads was flooded.  Oh well, I'll just wait until things dry up a little.  Around 2-ish I drove to my parents' house since I wasn't too far from their town.  I really needed to get gas too, and gas is usually cheaper in Baltimore.  So I took &quot;the boys&quot;, AKA the wiener dogs, with me since they just love going for rides in the truck.  Now I have dog nose print streaks all over the passenger side window!  <br /><br />Anyway, I also got some good tree and moon pictures, I just love the digital camera.  I'll post a couple of them here later this week.  <br /><br />Saturday morning and afternoon I watered plants, cleaned the fish tank, and did a little cleaning around the apartment.  I was planning to volunteer at Picnic with the Pops later that night, but my plans changed.  Around 2:00 Chrissie called and asked if I wanted to check out the old cemetery on Otterbein's campus.  I told her I couldn't since I was volunteering.  A few minutes later I called my mom (who also volunteers with PWP on Saturdays) and mentioned Chrissie's call.  My mom informed me that they had plenty of people to cover the gates, so she talked me into not volunteering that night.  I called Chrissie back and she hadn't made any other plans yet!  She had never gone on a cemetery exploration with me, so it was fun.  We went to the Olde Methodist cemetery at Otterbein, then went to the Pioneer Cemetery in Westerville since we were already in the area.  After that, we went to Leatherlips park.  Then we headed for <a href="greenlawn.html">Greenlawn Cemetery</a> since Chrissie didn't believe me when I told her that it is GIGANTIC.  Now I think she believes me :).  I also took her to the <a href="tico.html">TICO Cemetery</a>.  We tried to visit the Harper-McKinley Mental Hospital Cemetery too, but part of the road was a little flooded and I didn't want to get the truck stuck in the mud.  Yeah, I'm a little paranoid about things like that.  Anyway, since it was already 8:00 we decided to get some dinner.  We gossiped about other people we went to high school with, coworkers, and Chrissie's ex who also works at Nationwide.  I'm supposed to go to lunch with him sometime, I've just been putting it off because I don't think I really want to get in the middle of that.  Plus I've been busy and haven't wanted to take a long lunch (and I'm sure this would be a long one!). <br /><br />Yesterday I drove up to Lucas, OH in Richland County to check out a couple haunted cemeteries someone e-mailed me about.  They were pretty cool, but I'm not going to tell you anything else since I plan to have the new pages added to the site either tonight or tomorrow night...Wednesday at the latest!  So you'll just have to wait!<br /><br />Well, that was my busy, busy weekend!<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot...I left a comment in <a href="http://brendoman.com/houseofslug" target="blank">Luis'</a> blog this weekend in regards to the defensive driving course he was taking.  I mentioned that I had to take one of those after I flipped my car back in 1995.  He wanted to know how I flipped the car, and instead of leaving the story as a comment I have decided to post my answer here: It was October 24 of 1995, a little over a month after I got my driver's license.  I was driving my sister and I to a music lesson in my 1986 Chevy Nova, and I was driving down a little gravel country road.  I was going around a curve and hit the brakes to slow down....but the brakes locked up.  The car went into a skid on the gravel and I lost control.  The road had deep ditches, so when I went off the road I went into the ditch which caused the car to flip upside down in a wheat field.  I'll never forget seeing the windshield crack and the little green wheat shoots come through the cracks in the glass.  Anyway, Katy and I were OK since we had our seatbelts on...even though I'm not sure how since the roof on the drivers side hit a rock and was smashed almost down to the steering wheel.  I was in shock, but Katy was fine.  She called for help and told me that &quot;it was just like riding the zipper ride at the fair&quot;.  So in addition to the citation (failure to control) the judge made me attend a defensive driving course.  It was absolutely terrible!  It was really boring, the only thing that helped make the time pass faster was that a friend from band, Joe, was also in the class with me.  He rear-ended a Salvation Army truck!<br /><br />OK, I've got to get offline now...I'll try to blog later!<br><br>

Thanks to <a href="http://www.brianslife.net" target="_blank">Brian</a>, I have discovered the <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">The Friday Five</a>.  Here are my answers to this week's questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?</b><br>Of course I do!  Erin Martens, who was in my kindergarten class, met way back in the fall of 1984.<br /><li><b>Are you still in touch with this person?</b><br>No, I haven't seen her for several years.  We remained best friends through elementary school, but once we started junior high we started to go our own separate ways and weren't as close.  Then in the middle of my freshman year I went to a different school and we only talked once or twice a year.  I ran into her about a year after we graduated in 1997, but I don't think I've seen her since.<br /><li><b>Do you have a current close friend?</b><br>Yes, several.<br /><li><b>How did you become friends with this person?</b><br>Some are friends from high school, others are people I used to work with at Nationwide.<br /><li><b>Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?</b><br>No, not really.  I keep in touch with all of the people I really want to remain friends with.<br /></ol><br><br>

Let me get this out of the way first...I'm not annoyed with <i>all</i> of my coworkers.  The main reason I wanted to clarify this is because I know of one coworker who reads the blog regularly, and so does at least one of her kids.   She's not one of the ones I'm annoyed with :)<br /><br />Enough about that, on to other things!!!<br /><br />I found a new quiz today, thanks to <a href="http://graveaddiction.com/q2railgun/" target="_blank">Erik</a>:<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/B/basserfool/1054955791_essssfield.jpg" border="0" alt="dfd"><br>You're Mother Nature's Son!

I thought I might scratch out my right eye though...I don't know what it is about the building, maybe the air vents are filthy or something, but I have red, itchy eye problems in there all the time!  Kitty's eyes were bothering her today too, so at least it's not just me.  <br /><br />What else happened today?  Not much, I guess it was a pretty uneventful day.  I did get an e-mail from a person who visited my site and told me about a haunted cemetery in Ashland County I should visit...it's always exciting when someone tells me about a cemetery to visit!  I need to get back down to West Virginia so I can get some photos from cemeteries other than ones in Ohio for the site.  I'll also get some pictures from a couple cemeteries in Pennsylvania...my dad's family is from Uniontown so we're planning to go there later this year.<br /><br />Well, since I'm boring tonight, I'm going to sign off and call it a night!<br><br>

Well, I'm not feeling as bloggy today as I did yesterday.  In fact, I'll admit it...I'm in a not-so-pleasant mood.  Work has been making me feel this way a lot lately.  I'm thinking it's time for me to start looking for a job in another area of the company.  My three year anniversary with this department is tomorrow, July 10.  Sometimes it seems like there's no way I've been in the area that long, and other times it seems like I've been there for an eternity!<br /><br />I guess the main thing that has me feeling a little (well, a lot actually) down at work is that I feel like I'm stuck.  I know this is going to sound super whiny, but I always try to be friendly and as helpful as possible and I get absolutely no recognition for that.  I'm sure lots of people feel like that, but to be honest, I'm a quiet person who works with a bunch of loud mouthed people.  They whine and complain about their jobs all the time, and since I'm the quiet one I never get to.  And when I do start to complain about something, someone louder has to say &quot;you think you have it bad, well listen to how I'm treated...&quot;.  I'm tired of these people thinking I have it so easy.  The worst part is that I'm one of the only people who isn't married with kids on my team.  There are 21 or 22 of us, and only three of us are single and without kids.  And I know that I get a lot of the crappy, lots of overtime required projects because of that.  And no, I'm not just assuming that...my last manager (who I still work with a lot) said to me one time "I'm so glad that you're the person who volunteered for this.  I was hoping you would because it requires a lot of overtime and no one else can do that because they have families to take care of&quot;.  I couldn't believe she said that!!!  No, I don't have a husband or child, but does that mean that I don't have a family or friends (or even a social life) that I would like to spend time with?  Should that mean <b>I</b> should be the one who has to work the long hours?  Yeah, it's sad that other people might work some overtime and have a few hours less time seeing their child at night....but at the same time, should I have to work the overtime instead and miss family gatherings, the annual Christmas get together with my friends, my fourth of July plans, dinners, parties, club meetings, etc?  I still get furious when I think about that conversation!<br /><br />The other thing that prevents me from moving up the ranks is that I'm not a suckup.  I don't attend every department meeting and ask some dumbass question just to get myself noticed by upper management...if I had a question I'd definitely ask, but I'm not going to make one up just to make myself seem important.  I'm not always going to agree with everything my managers tell me...if I don't agree I'll say something to their faces instead of saying &quot;oh that's perfect!&quot; and then complain about it to all of my coworkers, just to kiss ass the next time I see the manager!  But that seems to be the only way to get ahead.  Yes, I'm still bitter that there were some promotions given to people this past April who are never in the office, who people are afraid to ask questions too, etc.  Seems like hard work gets you nowhere.  And when I ask my manager for feedback on things I can work on to get myself to the next level, he says &quot;just keep doing what you're doing, I can't think of anything you need to work on&quot;.  I guess I should be honored that he thinks I'm perfect or something :) Whatver, what kind of feedback is that?!?!?!?<br /><br />OK, so now I've vented/ranted.  I'm finished, I swear.  Whew, I feel better though!  Haha, bet tomorrow will be a day where one of my coworkers decides to visit my site.  Oh well, I haven't said anything that isn't true...and I haven't named any names!!!<br /><br />We're supposed to get more storms late tonight and all day tomorrow...bad ones too.  And the meterologist on the news tonight said it's supposed to be &quot;steamy&quot; tomorrow.  Enough of this hot summer stuff...I'm ready for fall!  Chilly nights and bonfires are the greatest!  I've only met one other person who loves bonfires (or any fires!) as much as me.  That was my old roommate Jen from Eastern Michigan University.  We weren't permitted to have candles in the dorms, but we snuck them in anyway!  We did have one scary experience with one once though.  There were four of us in the dorm, there were two bedrooms with a living room in the middle.  I was on Jen's computer in our bedroom, and we had lit a pine scented candle on the desk behind me.  All of my roommates were in the living room.  I smelled something burning, but I thought maybe someone burnt some food in the microwave.  Well, next thing I know I heard Jen behind me say &quot;Whoa, fire!&quot;  She said it kinda calmy, so I was shocked when I turned around and saw 2-3 foot flames on top of the tissue box that was sitting beside the candle holder!   We both stared at it in awe for several seconds, then we realized we better find something to put it out with!  We had our own bathroom in the dorm, so I grabbed a cup and filled it with water!  Then we doused the fire with that.  Our entire dorm room (and the hallway in front of our room!) smelled terrible, you could definitely tell that we had burned something!  But luckily we didn't get caught.  And it stopped us from burning candles for three whole days :)<br><br>

I've been feeling quite "bloggy" today...this is the third time I've posted today, which is very unusual since posting is usually a once-a-day thing for me (if that!).  <br /><br />First thing, I found out more info about the &quot;fire&quot; <a href="bbeast.html">Mark</a> asked me about this morning.  We didn't have a fire on the floor, but I guess the lights on the fire alarms started to blink.  The actual alarm didn't sound though.  However, I guess they still evacuated the floor.  I found all of this out while talking to the Six Sigma blackbelt in our department about automated testing stuff.  Anyway, I asked him what time they evacuated the floor and he said it was around 7:50-8AM.  I am POSITIVE that I was at my desk during that time, so I have absolutely no idea why I didn't hear him tell everyone to evacuate the building!  I must've been really absorbed in my work!!  Also, I was the only person in my aisle at the time, so I didn't see anyone else leaving their desks...maybe that's another reason I was oblivious to the whole evacuation thing.  I can't believe I was left at my desk to burn!!  It's sorta like the Salem witch trials, instead of tying me to a stake they just left the &quot;pagan girl who likes to visit graveyards and listen to evil music&quot; alone at her desk to burn!  How absolutely terrible!  Jeff, the blackbelt, said that he'll have to make a note to personally stop by my desk the next time we have to leave the building to make sure I'm not working so hard I'm oblivious to my surroundings :)  <br /><br />I went to dinner with Chrissie after work tonight.  We went to Don Pablos, our usual dinner place!  Mmmmmmm, we had frozen margaritas swirled with sangria...those are awesome after a day at work!  I had fun talking with her, it was nice to catch up on all of the gossip.  <br /><br />OK, that's about it for tonight.  Time for some Benadryl!!!  My sinuses or allergies or something has been acting up tonight, my eyes itch and I can hardly breathe.  They said on the news that all of the storms have caused people with sinus problems to have all sorts of issues, and they said that allergy sufferers also have it bad right now.  Yes, we've had lots of rain which should wash the pollen out of the air, but the storms have also had bad wind that stirs up all of the pollen.  I'm just having all sorts of <strike>issues</strike> fun!<br><br>

My friend <a href="oldblue.html">Mark</a>, who also works at Nationwide, just called a few minutes ago to ask if there was a fire on my floor...I guess there was a firetruck outside when he got to work, and someone told him there was a fire on the 5th floor.  I told him no one told us anything about it, so maybe it was on the opposite side of the floor?  <br /><br />When he called I also thanked him for helping me with a minor truck problem yesterday.  Sometimes after I get the truck's oil changed the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL" warning light in the message center still keeps turning on when I start it.  It doesn't stay on for more than 20-30 seconds, but it still annoys me.  Well, a few months ago Mark bought a 1999 Monte Carlo, which is the same year as Chuck (the truck).  Mark had the same oil light problem with his car, so being more proactive than me, he read the manual and found out how to reset it.  Since he knew his Chevy was the same year as mine, he gave me a call yesterday and asked if I'd like him to show me how to reset it.  So around 2 yesterday afternoon we took a field trip to the parking lot. Turns out I didn't need to pop the hood or anything...all you have to do to reset it is turn the truck on (not start it) and press the accelerator to the floor three times in a row.  Then when you start it, the light shouldn't turn on.  Well, when he started the truck yesterday the light blinked five times, then turned off.  We tried it again, and the same thing happened.  Well, when I left yesterday, the light didn't come on at all...it didn't even blink.  The light didn't come on this morning either.  So it worked!  Mark is a genius when it comes to cars (and Excel spreadsheets)!!!  <br /><br />Anyway, back to today's phone conversation.  After I thanked Mark and told him what a car genius he is, he said &quot;Well, like Vanilla Ice always says: If there was a problem, yo I'll solve it!&quot;....I couldn't help but laugh!  It's not everyday that someone quotes Vanilla Ice!!! :)  And I really didn't expect that from Mark, too funny!  <br><br>

Here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="_blank">This-or-That</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Strawberries or blueberries?</b><br>I like both, but I think I'd choose strawberries over blueberries.  I like eating strawberries &quot;plain&quot;, but I really only like blueberries as part of a recipe.<br /><li><b>"Legally Blonde 2" or "Terminator 3"?</b><br>I guess <i>Terminator 3</i>, even though I don't plan on watching either.<br /><li><b>Hamburgers or hot dogs?</b><br>Cheeseburgers<br /><li><b>Boating or hiking?</b><br>Definitely hiking<br /><li><b>Suntan lotion or sunblock?</b><br>Sunblock, I burn easily.<br /><li><b>"Big Brother" or "The Amazing Race"?</b><br>I'm assuming these are TV reality shows since I think I remember hearing my coworkers mention <i>Big Brother</i>.  I know I've said it before, but I rarely watch TV, and when I do it's usually the news.<br /><li><b>Beach Boys or Jimmy Buffett?</b><br>Beach Boys, just because I can't stand Jimmy Buffett<br /><li><b>Grow your own produce or buy from supermarket/greengrocer/farm stand?</b><br>I like growing my own, especially hot peppers!<br /><li><b>Drive with car windows/top down, or with air-conditioning on?</b><br>Drive with the truck windows down and the radio loud!!<br /><li><b>Go away for vacation, or stay at home?</b><br>It really depends...sometimes I like going away and seeing new places, but other times it's nice to stay at home and get housework done (or just lay around and do nothing!).<br /></ol><br><br>

My first day back to work after my shorter-than-everyone-else's holiday weekend actually went by rather fast.  Hopefully tomorrow will go by just as fast!  <br /><br />We've had a lot of rain here lately.  This afternoon's first storm hit just as I was leaving work.  The wind and rain were so bad that I waited inside for a few minutes until it slowed down.  I was still drenched by the time I made it to the car though.  But I was out of my cubicle so being drenched was a small price to pay :)  It stopped and started raining again shortly after I got home.  My plants are loving this!<br /><br />I think I talked my friend Chrissie into starting a blog.  I think everyone I know should have one, it's a much better than e-mail when it comes to keeping your friends and even family updated on everything that's going on.  And my mom is going to be helping my sister's cat Splotches with her own kitty blog.  I've finished the template, now all I have to do is pass it on to my mom/Splotches.  I'll DEFINITELY post a link to that one when she starts blogging!  I'm a little nervous to read what Splotch will say about me though, that cat HATES me (unless I'm giving her treats or scratching her face/ears).  I'm sure she'll mention past events, so I won't spoil it by writing about some of the terrible things Splotch has done to me over the past 8, almost 9, years.<br /><br />Well, I can't think of anything else tonight, so I'll blog more tomorrow!!<br><br>

I think the worst part of our quarterly QC process is that it totally messes up my sleep pattern.  This quarter we were estimating a start time of 5-6PM on 7/2 for QC.  Then it got pushed back to midnight...then 3AM on 7/3....then 6AM....then 9AM....then eventually it was decided that it would be sometime between 12-3AM on 7/4.  I left around 11AM on 7/2, I decided that I better go home and get some sleep in case I had to be back to work by midnight.  However, when I read my e-mails and saw that the estimated QC time kept changing I decided to stay up.  Since I was checking my e-mails almost every hour, I probably only got somewhere between 2-4 hours of sleep between 5:30AM Wednesday morning and 6AM Friday morning!!!   I got a call from Judy, one of the statements/confirms testers, at 8:45PM Thursday evening.  She said that we would have the statements to QC in about an hour.  Since I knew I'd run into lots of Red, White, and Boom (Columbus' fireworks) I left shortly after her call and got to my desk at 9:30PM.  It was 11:30-ish before Judy got back with the statements...the greenbar printer at Grove City was broken!  Anyway, we finally finished the QC process at 6AM Friday morning.  I was relieved that it was finally over so I could get some sleep!!!  I went to bed immediately when I got home, and slept until 2PM.  Then I drove down to my aunt and uncle's house in Baltimore for the family cookout.  When I got home around 11PM I tried to sleep, but since I had only been awake for 9 hours I wasn't tired!!!  I finally fell asleep around 4AM.  Anyway, I think my sleep pattern may almost be back to normal.  I hope so, if not I'm going to start taking Valerian root capsules or excederin PM!<br /><br />Other than the bad QC experience, the rest of my holiday weekend was fun.  I didn't do too much...just the cookout on Friday and volunteering at Picnic with the Pops on Saturday.  I did change the Grave Addiction <a href="index.html">index page</a>.  I just put all of the links in a table instead of having images to click on.  Should make the page load faster.  I also added a few new cemeteries to the site, <a href="newstuff.html">click here</a> to see the links to the new pages.<br /><br />I'll try to blog again tonight, going back to work has me depressed right now and I can't think of much to blog about.<br><br>

I'm not in the mood to post a "real" entry....let's just say this quarter end at work hasn't gone too well.  We still haven't received any output to QC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'll write all about my so called holiday weekend once this nightmare is all over.  For now, here's a link to a cool quiz Chrissie sent:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.colorgenics.com/index.cfm?pc=pythoncg2" target="blank">Archetype Test - http://www.colorgenics.com/index.cfm?pc=pythoncg2</a><br /><br />My results to the test:<br /><br /><b>The Spyglass</b><br /><br />Often concerned with right and wrong, and punctilious in expressing it, the Spyglass is best represented by the Customs Agent or the IRS inspector. This personality believes above all in the smooth and ordered flow of life. Initially seen by others as cold or uncaring, this personality is difficult for those more spontaneous members of society to understand. They appreciate plans and the best plan is one that has been used many times before.<br /><br />Similarly, this personality is extremely stable, responsible and dependable. They manifest an amazing ability to concentrate on the issue at hand, and are difficult to distract from issues that are important. They tend to be excellent and devoted employees and are often detail-oriented workhorses.<br><br>

The presentation went great!!  Actually, I probably could have made it a little scarier, all of the kids there seemed to like gory stuff.  One of the younger kids was telling me all about a ghost of someone who was killed by her father, so I doubt the &quot;ghosts in your own backyard&quot; issue I wrote about in my last post bothered that kid :)  Not if he was talking about people being killed!  Anyway, I didn't have any problem using up the whole hour, in fact, I probably could have talked longer.  Stefanie mentioned having me back to do another presenation this fall, this time for teenagers.  She even told me I should bring the Ouija board!!   That would be lots of fun.<br /><br />Speaking of ouija boards, Stefanie told me that her parents live in a really old farm house, and a long, long time ago a person died in their laundry room and another person was killed back by the creek behind their house!  She said I could come and visit sometime, maybe even bring the ouija board....I told her I'll definitely take her up on that offer!<br /><br />I just realized that I haven't blogged about my most exciting news from last weekend...I now have a digital camera!!  I finally decided to break down and buy one, nothing fancy - just a 2 megapixel for the websites photos.  It'll definitely save me tons of money as far as buying film and developing cemetery photos!  I've been having lots of fun taking pictures with it, here are a couple favorites:<br /><br /><center><br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/fish1.jpg"><br /><br />A photo of a few of my cichlids<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/osserorbs.jpg"><br /><br />A photo of my parents' dog Oscar, with orbs!!!!!<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/pvine.jpg"><br /><br />One of the blooms on my passion vine<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/lampfixed.jpg"><br /><br />A photo of the lamp from my great uncle's house, with the new lampshade<br /><br /></center><br /><br />And finally, here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="blank">This-or-That</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Lemonade or Ice Cold Beer?</b><br>If I had to choose one, I'd have to pick ice cold beer...I'm not a big fan of lemonade.  If I could choose something else though, I'd definitely pick iced tea or water!<br /><li><b>Swimming pool or beach?</b><br>The beach - at the pool all you can do is swim or lay out in the sun.  At the beach you can at least take a walk along the shore.<br /><li><b>Long weekends here & there, or a 2-week vacation?</b><br>Long weekends here or there...with a two week vacatation, once it's over that's it.  Long weekends here or there seem like more time away from work :)<br /><li><b>Destination: Acapulco or Hawaii?</b><br>I haven't been to either, so it's a tie...I'd like to see both!<br /><li><b>Destination: Mountains or Beach?</b><br>Definitely the mountains.  I'd rather do outdoorsy things than lay around on a beach.<br /><li><b>Hotel/motel/B&B or camping?</b><br>I love camping, but all of my friends and family hate it :(<br /><li><b>Carefully planned vacation, or play it by ear?</b><br>I kind of like an in between...I like planning things to a certain extent, but leaving some free time to play it by ear.<br /><li><b>Sneakers or sandals?</b><br>Sneakers, or closed-toe sandals.  I have awful toes, they're really short and if I wear open toes sandals it looks like I only have two or three toes...it looks strange!<br /><li><b>Air-conditioning or fans?</b><br>I'm going to have to agree with <a href="http://brendoman.com/houseofslug/" target="blank">Luis</a> on this one...definitely air conditioning!!!  It is nice to use fans with the air conditioning on though, it helps circulate the cool air.<br /><li><b>Concerts in the park or baseball games?</b><br>Concerts in the park, baseball bores me!<br /></ol><br><br>
