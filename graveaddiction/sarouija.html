On February 26, 2006 I received an e-mail from Sarah about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Okay, now I USED to be very skeptical about the ouija board...I've used them before, but they never made any sense. Since I don't know anyone who would ever want to play with me, I always play by myself.
<br><br>
The other night I was bored, so I decided to bring out my ouija board. First I asked if anyone was there.  It took awhile, but eventually it pointed to yes. Then I asked if they were a male or female, and how old they were when they died.  It said it was a female and she was 71. I asked if I knew her, and she said no.
<br><br>
This is where it gets interesting...my mom was working that night.  She usually works until 11:00, and always gets home around 11:30.  I asked the board what time she would get home, and it said 10:21.  This confused me. A couple of minutes after I finished using the board, my mom called and said she was leaving early.  She walked in the door at exactly 10:21.
<br><br>
I did a science test for school that day, so I asked if I passed.  It said yes, 84.  The very next day I got my test back and guess what?  I got an 84%!
<br><br>
At the time I was playing, I was still skeptical so I asked if it would give me a sign that someone was actually there.  At first it said yes, then it said no.  When I asked when I would get my sign it said TN.  I think TN meant tonight. I had my computer on, and when I was watching TV my computer just started to play my music.  I never touched it, so I think that was the sign.
<br><br>
Could this just all be wierd coincidences? I somehow don't think so.  I am no longer skeptical and believe that it actually does work.&quot;
