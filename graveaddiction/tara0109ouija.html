On January 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Tara about some interesting ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>

One night there were just a few girls and I playing at my best friend's house. Her parents didn't want her to have anything to do with the board, but they were going out that night to dinner with another couple. We were in her basement with only a few candles lit. Her computer was beside us, but the screen was turned off. After playing for a while, we asked what time it was.  It said 9:14, so I turned the screen on and it was 9:13.  Just then it turned to 9:14.  REALLY freaked us out. Anyway, we thought that was really cool, so we asked what time her parents would be home. The board said 12:09. My best friend thought that was ridiculous because her parents are NEVER out that late at all. Eventually, when we were still in the basement, we heard them unlocking the door...it was in fact 12:09. That was insane!!!
<br><br>
One night we were playing and asking it just random questions. My parents had been trying to sell their boat for a lonnnng time, maybe close to a year. Then it spelled out &quot;boat,&quot; so I asked if our boat would be sold soon.  It replied &quot;tomorrow.&quot; We asked to who, and it said &quot;B.B.&quot; I didn't think anything of it since it had been so long. Anyway, in the morning my mom woke me and the girls up and said, &quot;Guess what! We sold the boat!&quot; We asked to who, and she said &quot;Barry&quot; (last name started with B as well, just don't remember it!) Crazy!
<br><br>
My sister and I had been playing with the board for a while after my Grandmother had passed away to see if we could contact her. It said a few things that had really freaked us out that we believed in...stuff no one else would understand, so I wont bother to write it. My sister had become very very scared of the board and didn't know what to think of it. We went to play again one night after she asked me to play, and it would always talk to us except for this one time. I didn't understand what was going on, why it wasn't working. Turns out my sister had went to a priest and got a cross blessed that day and had it hidden in her lap at the table while we were trying to play...we believe that's why it wouldn't work.
