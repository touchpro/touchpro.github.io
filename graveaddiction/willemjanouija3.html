On May 30, 2007 I received an e-mail from Willemjan Kieffer about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I work at a supermarket in my village, and last week we where done early so we had to wait until 10 o'clock before we could leave. After work I planned to go my girlfriend's house to play with the ouija board, so I had it with me. I
suggested that we could play with the ouija board for half an hour, until we could leave. I was there with about ten people, and five of us, including my boss, decided to try it. The others went outside to smoke.
<br><br>
The five of us went to the cafeteria and prepared the board. For about 15 minutes nothing happened. Then we made contact with a spirit named Tony. He said he died in an accident at his old job. We asked where he worked. He said he worked at a slaughterhouse.  We then asked how he died. He told us that he tripped and fell into a meat slicing device.  He explained that back then there were no safety stop buttons or things like that, so when his coworkers finally turned off the machine he had died a horrible death.
<br><br>
We then asked him where the slaughterhouse was located. He said it was located &quot;here.&quot; My boss did know that there was something here before it became a supermarket, but he didn't know what. Then we asked Tony if he could show us something supernatural. He didn't answer. But then some of the kids who went outside to smoke said that the machines at the meat department all turned on. Our boss asked if somebody did that as a joke, but everybody said no. We thought it was a mechanical failure or something, so we went home. But about a week later our boss said there was a slaughterhouse there, and that there really was a kid named Tony who died there...
