&quot;If there's anything I can do for a veteran, I'll be there,&quot; said Neil Morgan. 
<br><br>
That's if they are living or dead. Morgan joined dozens of volunteers associated with veterans organizations the last couple of weeks to place new flags at all the graves of veterans before Memorial Day. 
<br><br>
The flags are provided each year through the Veterans Service Office. 
<br><br>
Morgan is one of the dedicated volunteers who handles the remote cemeteries down in the area south of Lancaster. 
<br><br>
&quot;A lot of people help out each year when we do this,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;I'm just one of many.&quot; 
<br><br>
But Morgan admits he put out at least 300 flags in the last couple of weeks, and some of them in some remote locations. 
<br><br>
&quot;Down at Pine Creek Estates there is a cemetery with only three graves in it. You have to park your car and walk 1/2 mile up a hill to get to it,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;One of the gravestones has just a last name, the date he died in 1880s and GAR on it. Nothing else is on it. But I go up each year, clean off the graves and put a new flag up.&quot; 
<br><br>
GAR stands for the Grand Army of the Republic from the Civil War. 
<br><br>
Morgan said he does it each year because he feels he owes something to the veterans who have passed away before him. 
<br><br>
&quot;We all owe the veterans something,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have anything.&quot; 
<br><br>
Morgan is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in the Marines from 1957 to 1960. 
<br><br>
Terry Whitehead, post commander for Lancaster's AMVETS, said recognizing the veterans on Memorial Day is very important. 
<br><br>
The AMVETS post had between 20 to 25 volunteers from the post, the Sons of AMVETS and the Auxiliary help go out and check on veteran graves. 
<br><br>
&quot;We were able to replace 2,000 flags,&quot; Whitehead said. 
<br><br>
In addition to AMVETS, the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars provided volunteers to go out and check on the graves and replace the flags before Memorial Day. 
<br><br>
In Fairfield County, approximately 11,500 veteran's graves are visited each year before the Memorial Day holiday. 
<br><br>
While the Memorial Day weekend is the traditional start of summer with backyard barbecues and family get-togethers, Morgan said he remembers the people who served with him and takes time out to honor those who have passed away before him. 
<br><br>
&quot;It's not much, but the flags are a sign we know what sacrifices they went through and we appreciate it,&quot; Morgan said. 
<br><br>
And it's not just Memorial Day and Veteran's Day when you see Morgan out at the cemeteries. Morgan carries a supply of flags in his car along with conflict flag holders. 
<br><br>
&quot;Whenever I go to the funeral of a veteran, I look around the cemetery and straighten out the flags and replace those needing replaced,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;It's just a sign of respect.&quot;
