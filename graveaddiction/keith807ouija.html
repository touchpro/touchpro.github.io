On August 23, 2007 I received an e-mail from Keith about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have spent my entire life since this incident trying to convince myself that it did not happen this way and that I was just remembering a sensational adolescent story.  As much as I try to remember it differently, I just cannot.
<br><br>
My friend Mike and I were about 13 years old, and we had recently been playing with a Ouija board.  We started out at his house, which was out in the Walnut and Almond Orchard area of California's Central valley.  There were a few stories of spirits that roamed the Orchards, three in particular in a place that everyone came to know as &quot;The Haunted Orchard&quot; which was less than a mile from Mike's house.  As the story goes, there were three men who were wrongly hanged for crimes they did not commit, actually being framed by a wealthy land owner who pinned some murders on them because of their vagabond nature.  That is all I remember about the story.
<br><br>
We first started out asking the Ouija board if there were any spirits from the Haunted Orchard, and aside from two child spirits, there was only one other that we seemed to make contact with.  Skilled Heir was the name of a local Indian who apparently witnessed the murders, and his spirit made itself known to us.  We spent a week asking him all sorts of questions, and finally one night it turned very ugly.  Skilled Heir was nowhere to be heard from, there was a spirit named Bael that had taken over the airwaves and the pointer never moved so fast as it did with him.  It was very precise in its answers and told us that it would not allow us to speak to Skilled Heir anymore.  So the next morning we tried for Skilled Heir again, and we got him.  I guess Bael was on lunch break LOL.  So here is where it gets unbelieveable.
<br><br>
It was a Saturday Morning and the sun was bright.  Mike and I were watching cartoons, and every now and then we would switch to the college basketball game - I think it was Syracuse and someone.  I remember Syracuse because of the orange jerseys they have.  All of a sudden the T.V. goes out.  The screen is full of snow.  So we ask Skilled Heir if he can tell us the score of the game and he replies &quot;yes.&quot;  Ok so what is it?  He said 62-58.  I remember the look in Mike's eyes, like he was thinking holy crap how cool is this gonna be if it's true?  But since the T.V. was out there was no way to tell the score.  Now we asked when the game would come back on.  The pointer then moved to 5...4...3...2...1, and this is where I get confused.  The score of the game was 62-58. Syracuse was winning, and that was the last time I ever touched a Ouija Board.
<br><br>
I still do not want to believe it.
