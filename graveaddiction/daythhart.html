Judy King has a manner that's almost casual for someone in her surroundings.  She's relaxed and comfortable as she relates story after story.  
<br><br>
Getting up from her chair, she stirs a large pot of just-picked beans simmering on the stove.
<br><br>
Trouble is, there's other stirring and simmering in King's home that would make most people uncomfortable.
<br><br>
&quot;The spirits haven't really done anything mischievous,&quot; she said.
<br><br>
She and husband Steven King - you have to let that name sink in for a moment - say they share their circa 1792 farmhouse with at least five ghosts: three little girls, a man and a pregnant woman.
<br><br>
At least is the operative phrase here.
<br><br>
They say their German Twp. home, tucked well back on a rocky lane, has also been home to the phalanx of spirits for many years, perhaps centuries.
<br><br>
Before buying the home in 1987, it belonged to Judy's parents - George and Pearl Gentry - for 35 years.
<br><br>
They also reported plenty of experiences with spirits.
<br><br>
Asked to pick a story, Judy King said, &quot;Everyone remembers this one: My mother had gone across the field toward the woods looking for a cow close to delivering a calf.
<br><br>
&quot;There was a storm approaching and the sky was getting dark.  The dogs had followed her.
<br><br>
&quot;She noticed the sky was getting darker and she decided to return to the house before the storm hit.&quot;
<br><br>
That's when the dogs ran off &quot;and my mother noticed a shadowlike figure beside her.  The figure was wearing a cape and top hat and terrified my mother.&quot;
<br><br>
King said her mother literally ran out of one shoe, which her brother retrieved the next day.
<br><br>
One time, when no one was home, King's mother was working outside when she noticed something in the front windows.  
<br><br>
&quot;Upon looking close, she noticed books being picked up from the windowsill and being paged through and then put back down,&quot; King said.
<br><br>
Her mother sat down on a rock near the driveway and waited for the family to return home.  
<br><br>
King said the strange happenings didn't stop when she and her husband moved in.
<br><br>
&quot;When we first moved in, our bedroom was the room back here,&quot; she said.
<br><br>
&quot;That was the original room of the house and there's an old road that used to go down in front of the house.&quot;
<br><br>
The outline of the road is still visible.
<br><br>
King said she used to hear carriage doors opening and closing.
<br><br>
There is also a young pregnant woman who cries all the time, yearning perhaps for a husband gone to war.  King said the legend is that she grieved herself to death in an upstairs bedroom.
<br><br>
Just a month ago, Steve came into the house, sat down in his favorite chair and &quot;saw somebody standing by the fireplace.&quot;
<br><br>
The figure was just as quickly gone.
<br><br>
In a room where wakes were once held, Judy said, &quot;Out of the corner of your eye, you can see people passing by.&quot;
<br><br>
Records as long ago as 1894 list 20 owners of the house, showing few were willing to stay very long in the house, which is featured in <i>Haunted Ohio IV</i> written by Greene County resident Chris Woodyard.
<br><br>
But now the place is for sale.
<br><br>
Judy, 64, a retired medical transcriptionist at Middletown Regional Hospital, and Steve, 58, retired from the Mound in Miamisburg as a chemical engineer, want something a little easier to care for, even though they rent the 66 acres for farming.
<br><br>
King said anyone interested in buying the place will get an unusual disclaimer.
<br><br>
&quot;We have to tell them,&quot; she said.
<br><br>
&quot;They get all the spirits wih it.&quot;
