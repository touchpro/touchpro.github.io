On December 5, 2009 I received an e-mail from April about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A few months ago, I was trying to use the ouija board with my friend, Sabrina. It's worked on some occasions, other times, it hasn't. This particular time we decided to try use it in my backyard, at 1 in the morning. It was very cold, and we sat on the grass near the door to my house.<br><br>
I remember feeling extremely cold, and feeling a cold draft flowing through our fingers and around the board.  When I used my other hand to compare the temperature near and away from the board, it was quite apparent that something, some kind of presence was with us, what felt like a cold breeze.<br><br>
We focused so hard on the planchette. We used a homemade board with a plastic cup as a planchette, and eventually the board moved to &quot;Q.&quot; I started having a shaking fit, I kid you not. I couldn't handle it, so we went inside and gave up.<br><br>
Last night, I had Sabrina over again, and another friend of mine, Tilly. At about 12 AM we begun playing, my parents were still up and everything. We lit two candles, placed them on my bookshelf to light up the room, sat on my bed, and used a homemade board with a silver coin as a planchette.<br><br>
This is how it went, from memory, as we didn't write it down.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: -moves around, not to any letters-<br>
<br>
This went on for ages. Just twitching, until Tilly took her finger off and sat and watched.<br>
<br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: (I think it went to yes, or just letters)<br>
<br>
Me: Who is this?<br>
Board: -tries to go off board, we pull it back to the middle-<br>
<br>
Tilly suggested asking if it was a good spirit.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you good?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Are you evil?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Sabrina began to freak out.<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you after?<br>
Board: (it spelled out &quot;April,&quot; and then tried my last name but spelled it wrong)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you after anyone else?<br>
Board: s z s h<br>
<br>
Sabrina started crying. These are her initials. She has a really weird middle name, it's &quot;Zara&quot; I think.  I told her not to cry, as that would make matters worse.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you attatched to this house?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
The conversation was feeble. Although it was a strong force, it kept trying to go through the alphabet and also tried to go through the numbers.<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you from?<br>
Board: hell<br>
<br>
Me: Does Satan exist?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Not once, may I add, did the demon attempt to say &quot;666&quot; or &quot;616&quot; at all.<br>
<br>
I had previously spoken to what I think was my spirit guide with my psychic friend, Lauren. I called for it on the board.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Heart? (my angel's name)<br>
Board: (goes to yes)<br>
<br>
I began crying.<br>
<br>
Me: What is your message?<br>
Board: b e o p h i s (something or other)<br>
<br>
It then started saying something else.<br>
<br>
Board: s i s i s i<br>
<br>
I was like, wtf? We didn't get this at all.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Heart?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
I was pissed off beyond belief that it had lied to me.<br>
<br>
Me: (wanting answers) Are you a demon?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you from hell?<br>
board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is it possible to befriend a demon?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
I had no intention on doing this at all.<br>
<br>
Sabrina: We're not befriending you. Ever.<br>
<br>
Me: Does heaven exist?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you love Jesus?<br>
Board: -no movement-<br>
<br>
Me: Are you banned from speaking of God?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Whenever the board made no motion, we beleived it meant yes, it just couldn't say.<br>
<br>
Such as, does Jesus exist?<br>
Does God love me?<br>
Can we get rid of you?<br>
Can we purify ourselves?<br>
<br>
We eventually got used to the demon being there. Apparently, it had been following us ever since the session we did in our backyard, and had appeared in a dream Sabrina had of a black shadow standing by her bed, which said &quot;I wouldn't come in here if I were you.&quot;  At the time she was standing in the doorway of her room.
<br><br>
I have witnessed this demon. I see it in the corner of my eye, I see it standing as a black figure and look up to see it gone. It moves, I see it, but when I look at it, it is gone.
<br><br>
Tilly pointed out that there was a Bible on my floor, which I hurriedly grabbed.<br>
<br>
I said a psalm that was supposed to be said when needing God's protection. I then asked Tilly to read it while we did the ouija, except for her to modify it so it said &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; instead of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;I.&quot;
<br><br>
We opened the session, and held the coin planchette in the middle of the board. Tilly spoke the verse about three times. When she had finished, I used quick thinking and made up my own verse, saying things such as:
<br><br>
May god protect our innocent souls,<br>
May his overhelming love purify us all,<br>
And may he forgive us our sins,<br>
And the sins of this umpire creature,<br>
May his heartwarming presence fill our hearts with purity...<br>
<br>
Something like that.<br>
<br>
While saying that, it tried moving to &quot;s z s h&quot; very slowly, almost like it was weak.
<br><br>
I then proceeded to close my eyes and chant &quot;I now call upon a higher source,&quot; over and over again.
<br><br>
The second I began saying it, the planchette began moving to goodbye. It got to goodbye and we turned it over.
<br><br>
I felt like we had prevented it for now.
<br><br>
We go to a Catholic school, so I plan on asking my priest to purify us tomorrow.
