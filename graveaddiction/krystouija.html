On March 14, 2005 I received an e-mail from Krystal Coulter about her experience with the ouija board.  While I don't agree that the ouija board is as dangerous as she does, it's a very interesting story!
<br><br><br>
&quot;I never used to believe in the Ouija board.  Like many others I heard stories from my older cousins growing up and I just thought they wanted to scare me.  It wasn't til two friends and I sat down the weekend of Labor Day 2004 that my opinion was drastically changed.  
<br><br>
A couple of days prior I was at my friend Jamie's watching TV when she started pestering me about playing the Ouija board.  I kept telling her no, that my mom always said that you shouldn't play with black magic, but she wouldn't leave me alone so I finally gave in.  We started by asking stupid questions like most people.  Though Jamie and I were good friends there were things that I never talked about with her such as my late grandparents.  I didn't believe so I asked what my grandma's real name was and it spelled out Constance.  Even if I had mentioned my grandmother to Jamie I would have called her Grammy or Grandma Connie never by Constance.  It knew other things about me such as my grandpappy's name and how he died, my mom's birthday and my social security number.  Jamie started asking the board about if ghosts haunted my house and it said yes that two reside in my home.  Of course I didn't want to know about these things, I have to live there alone for Christ's sake.  It said that one of the ghosts names was Theresa and that she died in the bath tub in the apartment above mine and that she enjoyed being in my bathtub.  
<br><br>
The next day I was talking to my neighbor lady who told me that a lady had in fact died in her bath tub, and before I could even ask if her name was Theresa she told me that was her name.  I was wigged out but still thought that Jamie was messing with me even though I always leave my porch light on when I leave for the day and make sure the TV is shut off. Ever since Jamie and I played with the Ouija board they would be reversed when I got home and none of the alarm clocks in my house would work.   
<br><br>
So when Labor Day weekend rolled around Jamie and my other friend Heather were at my house enjoying a girls's night when Jamie suggested we play the Ouija board. I knew it was a bad idea.  At first we just goofed off but eventually the oracle was moving so quickly that we could barely keep our fingers on it.  Heather and I have been best friends our whole lives but she and Jamie were merely minor friends - this will be important later.  While we were playing, the board contacted a ghost that was just down right mean.  He started saying things about Heather's mom who passed away when we were 14.  Jamie thought I was doing it but Heather's mom was just like my own mother and I would never do that to Heather.  It just kept going on and on about her mom to the point that Heather became very upset and refused to play.  No matter where she sat in the room the oracle followed her.  The board would only work if Jamie's fingers were on it.  The board told us it was because it couldn't use Heather because her soul belonged to the devil and was no good, and that my soul wasn't strong enough to pull a force but if need be it could go through me. 
<br><br>
Knowing that we had crossed a line we tried to say goodbye just like the rules tell you but the oracle kept going to six, it made it there twice before Heather threw it off the board.  I demanded that we say goodbye because I didn't want the evil spirt left in my home.  The minute we placed the oracle back on the board it started back towards six.  It may seem impossible but it took all three of us pulling hard to get to goodbye.  By the time we placed it back in the box we were all very terrified.  We left the house with the board and threw it in the river after placing a phone call to Heather's sister who had her own terrifing experiences with a Ouija board that included the oracle moving on it's own.  She told us that we had to wipe olive oil on all the doors and windows while saying &quot;we bless this house, all spirts be gone&quot;.  We were standing at my porch door, the last door before we had completed the task when Jamie became hysterical and ran into the living room.  By the time we caught up with her she could barely breathe and Heather was screaming to just get it done so we could leave.  Once we were in the car Heather asked if anyone else saw what she had.  Jamie said that she saw a man that was so evil looking and that's when Heather finished her sentence and said then he turned into a cloud of black smoke.  See, that's why Jamie ran into the living room and Heather was screaming.  Once we left my house we looked for a church but they were all closed.  None of us are very religous but to this day we all wear crosses as a reminder why we'll never touch an oracle again.&quot;
