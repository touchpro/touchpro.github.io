On January 4, 2009 I received an e-mail from Krystal about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My cousin, Nick, and I, Krystal, made our own Ouija board after reading some stories online about other people's experiences. We lit candles and incense, and turned out the light.
<br><br>
Krystal: Are there any spirits here who wish to speak with us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: What's your name?<br>
Board: Jasper<br>
<br>
Nick: Is your name Jasper?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(At this point I was so afraid that I was teary eyed and shaking. It was my first time, so it was a little scary to me.)
<br><br>
Krystal: How old are you?<br>
Board: (tried to move to the numbers, but the planchette budged up against some cardboard that stuck up from the side.)<br>
<br>
Then Nick and I took it into his sister's room, Kristen, because we wanted to prove to her that it was real.  She's all sciency and still refuses to believe, even after what happened next.
<br><br>
Krystal: Is there anyone else here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: What's your name?<br>
Board: An<br>
<br>
Krystal: Your name is An?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: Do you want Kristen to believe in you?<br>
Board: No movement<br>
<br>
Krystal: Do you think Nick is stupid?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(then Kristen put her hands behind her back and asked me to ask the board how many fingers she has up)<br>
<br>
Krystal: How many fingers is she holding up?<br>
Board:4<br>
<br>
(It was right, and everyone was amazed. So she tried again, because she thought her brother told me how many she had up.)
<br>
Krystal: How many fingers is she holding up now An?<br>
Board: No games.<br>
<br>
(She help up 0, to try to fool my &quot;sub conscience&quot;)<br>
<br>
Krystal: Are you mad that Kristen tried to trick you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(we took a break)<br>
<br>
Krystal: Is there anyone here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Nick: Do you think Krystal is hot?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Nick: Is this An?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: Can we talk to Jasper?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: Hello Jasper, can you move something in the room for Kristen?<br>
Board: no response<br>
<br>
Krystal: Can you move something?<br>
Board: no response<br>
<br>
Krystal: Are there any evil spirits in the house?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Krystal: Are you evil, Jasper?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Krystal: Can you guys hurt us?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
(At that time, it moved my hand close to a candle we had by the board)<br>
<br>
Krystal: did you just burn me on purpose?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Krystal: Do you want to hurt us?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Nick: Are you going to hurt us?<br>
Board: no response<br>
<br>
Krystal: What's the name of the evil spirit?<br>
Board: Pao<br>
<br>
Nick: Is he a pyro?<br>
Kristen: Why do you have to automatically think it's a guy?<br>
Krystal: Nick! Don't ask stupid questions!<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Krystal: We would like to thank you for your time and information, Jasper and An. Goodbye for now.<br>
Board: Goodbye
