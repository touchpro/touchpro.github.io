On November 30, 2005 I received an e-mail from Jesse Oliver about his very interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br><br>
It all began a little into our grade nine year. Evan, after we had told him to do so for many weeks, finally brought his Ouija board that he claims came from an old woman at a garage sale. We decided, to add to the mystical powers, that we would burn a pentagram into the bottom, and we found a whole bunch of cool looking symbols from my Necronomicon and drew them around the pentagram. So with our new weapon in hand, we made our way into the forest.
<br><br>
The trees are really wide in the forest, reaching far up into the sky. The Kwantlen Indians supposedly used to practice Tree Burial, meaning that they would put a person in a tree and burn them when they died. Or for torture.
<br><br>
As of now, though, we didn't know any of this, and we would not have believed it even if we had known. All we saw were many trees and a prime spot to summon some spirits.
<br><br>
We made our way into a clearing, and Evan explained the rules: that at least two people had to have their hands on the cursor at all times and you couldn't release it without saying goodbye properly. At first, it was Chris
and Conor that had their hands on it. I had previously, with Evan, met a ghost named Gustav on a tree stump, but this was deeper in the forest, and therefore seemed more appropriate for such a dark ritual.
<br><br>
Chris and Conor appeared to know what they were doing. Conor was actually the reason why we were doing this. He had supposedly summoned a strange, rat-like creature on a Ouija board that he had owned, and his friend had
apparently been demonically possessed. We later found out that the spirit within his friend had been Zisi, the silencer of arguments and a relatively peaceful demon, the 19th in the list of names of the elder god Marduk.
<br><br>
Now, however, we were playing in the woods by our school at lunch. Some older students saw us and laughed, and the principal came by with an alleged report of violence, but he did not seem to care about us performing
ritualistic rites on his grounds. He just smiled and went on his way, confident that we weren't up to mischief.
<br><br>
After the spirits assured us that they were there, Chris accidentally moved his hand from the cursor, leaving only Conor's hand on it. Evan punched Chris, and Michael and I joined our hands onto the board and said goodbye.
The cursor moved to the engraved GOODBYE.  We were terrified, but then we calmed down and found it silly that we believed in such a thing.
<br><br>
Over the next couple of days, we came into the forest just to hang out. It was I believe a week later when we saw the first odd sign: a huge slash across a tree, burned black and at least twenty feet up. We saw many 4:20's
carved into trees, but when we could find no relevant passage in the Bible, we delved deeper and found out that that was national marijuana day.
<br><br>
But the burns continued. A near-identical burn was found on a different tree on the other side of the woods. Some days, the bases of all of the trees were blackened. We thought it might just be water, but we managed to
pick ash off of these burns. The next day, they would all have disappeared.
<br><br>
Orange ooze appeared on some of the trees. Then pink ooze. Then green ooze. A rock had a vein in it that looked like The Blair Witch. But the burns were what was truly unnerving. An entire tree became black, and another was
hollowed out and singed all the way up, with what appeared to be a suicidal poem written on the side, though it had been burned out of recognition.  Several un-burnt slashes appeared in the trees, though not enough to yet be
alarming.
<br><br>
The first time that the forest tried to hurt us occurred near the end of the school year. Michael and I had found an image of a skull in the ground, so we naturally decided to dig. We found nothing. We knew lunch was over, but we felt a strange presence in the forest that day. It felt hostile. We decided to explore some more.
<br><br>
We went off the beaten path and saw a stump which had been chopped like a crucifix. As I examined this closer, Michael went off into the brush. That is when I heard the buzzing. I looked up as he asked what was crawling on
his back. It was a horde of wasps, buzzing like mad. I ran towards him, swatting, and one stung me mere centimeters from my eye, and one on my neck and shoulder. Michael was not so fortunate. He got stung over twelve times.
<br><br>
Over the summer we didn't think much of any of this. Then we went back to the school in grade ten, and decided to see if the burns had come back in our absence. They had.
<br><br>
We started going to the forest every lunch: Adam, Michael, Nathan, occasionally Evan, and myself.  We saw more and more burns. Then we saw it. A black shape move across the path, in the shape of a three in the air. But it
was too quick. This was on a particularly rainy day, and small streams were starting in the cold BC autumn.
<br><br>
Over the next couple of days, we saw more and more of these black shapes.  Evan told us that he had seen it once as a child, in the form of an enormous black dog. That is when the black shape took form.
<br><br>
Sometimes it was a blob, other times it was a man, and occasionally it was a giant lizard climbing up the trees. We never saw it for more than a few seconds, but we knew it was there. I swear that I saw it. Purple specks also
dotted some areas, and in front of a large tree that our Wiccan friends had previously performed a ceremony in front of, which we called Wicca Point, we were all different sizes. The tallest would be shorter, and the shortest a behemoth. When we got away from the tree, where they claim they summoned the Sky Goddess, who is vehement, we were all our normal sizes once again.
<br><br>
We all saw these things. But the one who saw them the most was Adam.
<br><br>
I then saw the girl. She was crawling across the floor, and I only caught a glimpse of her, but she was wearing all white and her skin was sallow. We dubbed her &quot;the crawler&quot; and continued our investigations. We soon noticed that these spirits only appeared when Adam was in the woods. Adam claims he had a vivid vision of the girl falling into the brush, dead. We looked up police records, and saw one picture that still haunts me to this day.
<br><br>
The dead face of a beautiful young girl with scared eyes and long black hair.
<br><br>
We had seen enough. We decided to bring the Ouija board back in.
<br><br>
We asked if the spirits were there. They were. We asked if they wanted to wish us harm. They said yes. We asked if they were all the spirits. They said no. We asked to talk to the little girl, and they agreed. We all got
the feeling of dread in our stomachs, as if the spirit of the girl was frightened. We asked her what her name was and she answered PETOS. We said we would help her.
<br><br>
The black shape apparently loomed behind me at that point. Soon, Michael felt a tap on his shoulder and there was a wet mark. Skeptics claim that it was just rain, but Michael swears that it was a human finger tapping him. He later went on to scribble absent-mindedly on a piece of paper, and looking down saw a picture of a girl in a white dress. It was clear that Petos had grown some sort of attachment for him.
<br><br>
Adam and I often had the same visions of Petos, either turning in a bush or just standing on water. When we went up to the water, there were footprints under it, though there were none on the soft ground around the puddle, and
they began halfway through the pond. And I swear that I saw Petos turn and look at me on a path outside the forest. She then faded behind a tree. That was the clearest I ever saw her. She had black hair and sad eyes. She was a beautiful young girl.
<br><br>
It was then that we wanted to see these spirits. When we said aloud that we meant them no harm but wanted to see them beyond a doubt, there was no answer. So we brought back the Necronomicon and did an incarnation for the
great serpent.
<br><br>
Nothing appeared for several weeks. Just as we were beginning to think that it was all in our minds, the rains came back in the dead of winter. We didn't care, and made our way across the soggy grass as soon as lunch began.
In the forest, Adam would not cross the running water, or only did so with support from us. We all heard bells, but Adam swore that mixed with the chimes there was angelic singing. There was also a tap-tap-tap. It turned
out to be a woodpecker.
<br><br>
The trees twisted, or so it had seemed. All of the branches looked like a Tim Burton movie, and crows flocked. One day when we said that it was too quiet, as if on cue, a deafening roar came from the distance, like an Ent
out of The Lord of the Rings. Evan claimed that it was just a plane changing mock speeds, but we looked that sound up and it was not even close. The roar we had heard sounded like a huge beast. And Evan had claimed that earlier, he had heard an overpoweringly loud hissing, like a giant snake. He didn't know that we had tried to summon spirits, or said the incantation for a big snake.
<br><br>
One day Adam was a bit skeptical about crossing a small stream which ran from a big hole in the ground, which had filled up with rain. As I was inspecting a seagull, which had been torn to shreds, I heard a noise like a
radio changing channels quickly. It had been Adam. He then did it again, and he did not remember doing it.
<br><br>
That seagull had not been the only casualty. There were many squirrels in the forest, and one day we found one dead. We also found a decapitated owl. There was a rogue and rather friendly coyote in the woods, and I still
believe that was the culprit to the birds. The squirrel, I think, died of natural causes. But that does not make it any less unnerving.
<br><br>
There was also a man in the forest who swept the paths with a broom made of twigs tied to a large stick. We called him The Sweeper, and he was a kindly old man who spoke in a what we think was Deutsche accent. We only heard him talk once when we asked him the time, and he had a knack for being there whenever we felt truly afraid. There was another man who sometimes chopped wood, but he is of no significance.
<br><br>
It was right before spring break when it got truly terrifying. It was Michael, Nathan, and I in the woods. Most of the school was at home, already enjoying their break, but we had to stay one more day to try to catch up on
work, along with a few handfuls of other students, one being Adam. I had been fruitlessly trying to tutor him in math all morning, but his inability to grasp the concepts angered me so I led the other two to the forest
without him. About twenty minutes later, he showed up.
<br><br>
Stumbling out of the brush, we knew something was wrong with Adam. He had stumbled several times before on odd roots, as if the twisting limbs had been mocking him. But this time he was more or less slowly charging. He
looked us all deeply in the eye, encircling us, before he let out an inhuman roar and Michael darted off, being the fastest.
<br><br>
At this point, Adam was still overweight. He has since slimmed down considerably, but a man of his size at that time should not have been able to run as fast as he did that day. Especially when he had a knee condition and was wearing untied bowling shoes.
<br><br>
Nathan and I ran down the other path, and then realized that we had to go back for Michael. Adam was running towards us as we had retraced our steps, roaring furiously. I had never truly ran for my life before, but this time I was. Nathan took a path to the right, and Adam continued straight after me. I didn't know if Michael was okay or not. I looked back, and Adam stopped, roaring at the sky. I ran to the opposite side of the forest, and thankfully saw Nathan and Michael. We all sat down on a log to think, but then Adam was mere feet away. That was the single most terrifying event of my entire life.
<br><br>
We ran out of the forest, and Adam dropped to the floor. Flat onto his face. We took a large stick, but just as we were about to prod him awake, he got up, shaking. I suggested that we should take him back in to see if it
happens again. When we were in there, he started listing things that we had done in the forest on days that he had not been with us. At one point, he gracefully climbed a tree the same way a friend of ours had weeks earlier,
unbeknownst to him. When he started growling again, we quickly escorted him out. When he fell down again, we roused him and he said that the last thing he remembered was walking from the classroom and exiting the school.
<br><br>
Adam then reported seeing the black shape everywhere, and seeing faces in windows. We never saw the black shape again, but we saw Petos occasionally, looking scared.
<br><br>
It was in February that the event happened that, unfortunately, I and my friends will never forget. Ever.
<br><br>
Adam was in the forest again. Then he started strangling Michael. I chucked a rock at him, and our friend Mark, a religious man, ran out of nowhere and helped us pry Adam off of him. I took a side exit, and Adam pursued Nathan, Mark, and Michael down the path. I went back in and yelled to get Adam's attention, helping my friends escape.
<br><br>
When we were out of the forest, and after Adam had roused himself from the collapse, he was still shaky. He occasionally let out a guttural growl, and he drew a snake with his foot in the gravel. He bowed to an invisible God and when he arose there were claw prints where his hands should have been. We were talking to him all the while, asking, pleading, begging him to come back to us, reminding him how great of a friend he was. Then he let out an inhuman noise and fell to the ground. Nathan and Michael sat on him, and I held his feet. We knew what we had to do, and Mark began the impromptu exorcism.
<br><br>
We knew a lot about it. I had studied it. Michael and Adam were the only non-Christians there that day. For an hour and a half we endured spitting, biting, cursing, pushing and complaining from the demons within. He spat up
globs of yellow, which apparently beckoned to worms to arise, and a crow cawed at us from atop a lamppost. After half an hour of threats in three different demonic voices that when asked later Adam could not reenact, Michael ran down the street to an ancient church. Adam warned us that the &quot;one in black&quot; would die on the way. When Michael came back a horrendous twenty minutes later, in which Adam had told me he was saving the darkest
corner of Hell for me, bitten Nathan's finger nearly to the point of drawing blood, tried to suffocate himself, and gotten three light gashes on his forehead from supposedly holy water, we asked him if he was alright. He said
that besides a car nearly hitting him, he was fine.
<br><br>
Mark and I decided to try another church, since the first one had no priest therein. This one was right across the street, so we knocked on all of the doors. Nothing. I found some wood, and brought it back. Hundreds of
feet away, the screams of the demons in agony could be heard. All of our voices were raw from yelling over the tormented wails, yet Adam showed no sign of letting up. I told him the cross had been from a crucifix. He
laughed his guttural laugh and spat on me. He then told Michael that he wanted to commit sexual acts with a girl that none of us knew about. When we asked Michael who she was, he said it was a girl he had been talking to,
unbeknownst to us.
<br><br>
He then began speaking in other languages and quoting Bible scriptures that, when we asked him later, he had never read. He then said he would leave Adam if we brought him another person to enter. We said to go into a
worm he had brought forth. He replied, &quot;Fool! I AM the worm!&quot;
<br><br>
After many minutes of pain for us, he agreed that he would give Adam temporary rest but would return tomorrow at lunch. Adam stopped moving, and then awoke and started crying, claiming that he was confused and that he
thought it was his first day of grade seven. Desperately hoping the demons hadn't been in him that long, we took him back to the school.
<br><br>
The vice principal, since we would not tell her what had happened to him, thought we were on drugs. We told her we were not. But she would soon see what had happened.
<br><br>
The next day I was aghast that Adam's parents had let him come to school. Apparently he had been screaming in his sleep for some time now. In the morning he shoved our friends around. And at lunch it came out again.
<br><br>
But it was different this time. In the school he appeared to be in pain and spoke as an old man, saying that it was blessed. The Kwantlen Indians had blessed the school as soon as it had been opened from the spirits of their
burial ground in and around the forest.
<br><br>
Outside, Adam growled and hissed once more. But he also broke into his old self, begging for help. Mark and I took him to the church. Michael and Nathan kept everyone else calm.
<br><br>
At the church, the priest was not in. It had been very difficult getting the complaining demons there. He yelled at traffic, and I was afraid he was going to get hit. He took a swing at a couple of kids, and even picked up a
large stick at one point, but then this conversation ensued to himself:
<br><br>
&quot;Do it you worthless slime!&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;No!&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;You must listen to me, fool! I am legion of many and I own you!&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;No!&quot;
<br><br>
With tears in my eyes, I saw Adam triumph and throw the stick away. But at the church he was his possessed self once more. We took him back across the street to the school, to which several people told me that my friends were
in the woods, looking for me. My heart stopped. Michael ran out, and Adam grabbed him, but he just took off his sweater and darted to the woods. Mark went to get the teachers.
<br><br>
Our friends were in the forest, wondering where we were. The trees were calm. But when we went over the hill to the school, we heard screaming as Adam was walking, hunched over, large rock in hand, around the portables,
following small kids. I helped the teachers get everyone inside, and within minutes police officers arrested Adam.
<br><br>
He woke up halfway to the station.
<br><br>
Adam was not at school for the next month, but the rumors were. We managed to silence them all. When he got back, he was not allowed in the forest until the next school year, and at lunch he had to be supervised in the office. He told me that in the office he felt like killing people. Only once more did he get into the dreamy state that he got before he became possessed, but he took himself to the office, not letting it win.
<br><br>
The doctors claim it was a rare type of epilepsy where your brain can not distinguish between fiction and reality. I have other thoughts. But I do not believe that we will ever do.
<br><br>
Over the summer, Michael walked back to the forest. He sat down where we had done the first Ouija board, and all burns were gone. The hole that had appeared out of nowhere and filled with water was filled up as if it had
never been there at all. Michael stood up after an hour or so of deep contemplation and said aloud, &quot;Goodbye, Petos.&quot;  At that point, a wind went through the leaves and a baby rabbit hopped out of the ferns.
<br><br>
Adam went back into the forest this year, and nothing happened except us having a great time like we used to. I think that the reason we had initially believed it was because it was an opportunity for four or five friends to have a great time. It evolved into something else. But I would not take it back. Evan has become calmer, I have become more religious, Mark has become more confident, Michael more aware and open-minded, and Nathaniel more thoughtful. And Adam has become a much better person. We never saw the shadow again.
<br><br>
Just a month or two ago, Nathan and I went into the forest one last time, and found some rocks. With a marker, we wrote names on each one: MARK, MICHAEL, EVAN, ADAM, JESSE, NATHANIEL and PETOS. We placed them on the main
path.
<br><br>
It was a list of people who were changed or saved by our experience. Our experience that proves that nothing can break friendship like we have. On the surface, we are great friends. But on the inside we are people who stood
by each other, and will always stand beside each other, as we did and will do the incredible. We are people who saved the girl in the forest.
