On August 23, 2009 I received an e-mail from Angel about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Ashley and I decided to make a ouija board one night. We played with it for a little while, then got tired and decided to play with it the next day.
<br><br>
When we woke up, we went straight to the board. We said our prayer and began.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits who want to talk with us right now?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Anote<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have anything to tell us, Anote?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What would you like to tell us?<br>
Board: BEADEVUPDE<br>
<br>
We got really confused and decided to say goodbye. We went on google and tried to figure out what she meant, and we figured out it was a German word. We decided to go back to the board.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits who want to talk with us?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Anote?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What country are you from?<br>
Board: Germany<br>
<br>
Me: When did you die?<br>
Board: 1824<br>
<br>
Me: How old were you?<br>
Board: 68<br>
<br>
Us: I'm sorry<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: C<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die of cancer?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Did you live a happy life?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Then the board moved to goodbye.<br>
<br>
Then Ashley thought about the family tree her mom had put together, and about how her family had came over from Germany around the 1830s. We decided to open the board again.<br>
<br>
Me: Are there any spirits who want talk to us?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Anote?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know one of us?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know me?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know her?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: How do you know her?<br>
Board: G<br>
<br>
Me: Grandma?<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
Me: Is there anyone who wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Anote?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: How is she related to you?<br>
Board: booi<br>
<br>
Then we quickly looked up booi and it turned out to be a family tree resource site.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know her name?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is it?<br>
Board: Ashley<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want to talk to Ashley?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Ashley then asked questions about herself, which were all answered correctly.<br>
<br>
Later...<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been following Ashley?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Ashley: Are you my guardian angel?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Immediately, Ashley started crying.<br>
<br>
Ashley: Can you see me?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Ashley: Where are you?<br>
Board: bed<br>
<br>
Ashley: So you are related to me?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Ashley: What's your last name?<br>
Board: booi<br>
<br>
Ashley: Are you on my family tree book?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
We sat there thinking of more questions to ask, then suddenly the planchette started to spell something out...<br>
<br>
Board: Anote is dead.<br>
<br>
Too afraid to ask who was there, we closed the board.
