On October 21, 2007 I received an e-mail from Alex Burton about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Alex Burton, and I live in Florida.  One day I was over at my friend's house, and when we get bored we play with her Ouija board.  We were in the middle of a conversation with a spirit we had never talked to, named Xevier, when all of a sudden he said, &quot;Alex Im Sorry.&quot;  I asked what he was sorry about, and he spelled out a word that was very close to my dog's name.  I asked if he was talking about my dog, Guinness, and he said yes, and that she was going to die of cancer.  Now, right before that, my dog had gotten sick, but when we took her to the vet, he said it was just
a stomach virus.  So we were giving her medicine and she was getting better.  Later on that week, she got sick again...when we took her to the vet once more, they gave her an X-ray and found an inoperable tumor on her heart.  I miss my dog like crazy.
<br><br>
But now I have my own Ouija board, and I still talk to Xevier, who turned out to be my spirit guide.  He tells me that he takes care of her, and that she is still in my house...sometimes she's in the room when I'm talking to him, sleeping on the bed or something.  I can tell she's there...there's this presence in the room.  But from now on, I take Ouija boards very seriously.
