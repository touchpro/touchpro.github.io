On January 11, 2005 I received an e-mail from my friend Mark Jordan about a really eerie ouija board story concerning his birth:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Back in the 1960's my mom had a very difficult time giving birth to her second child, my older brother. She almost bled to death before they could stop the bleeding. For her health's sake, they recommended that she get her tubes tied, and she did. This should have made it impossible for her to have any more children. A couple of years later, she was at a friend's house where some people were playing with a ouija board. They told her to ask it something, but she was skeptical, so she decided she'd ask a &quot;trick&quot; question. She asked the board how many children she would have. The answer came back: &quot;3&quot;. She laughed and said, &quot;Well, that proves it's phony: I had my tubes tied after my second. I can't have any more kids.&quot; Everyone was surprised to see the board get caught up in an outright mistake. A couple of years later, though, the board must have had the last laugh. Mom's stomach suddenly began swelling and the doctor was afraid it was a tumor. He did an X-ray and was very shaken to find instead that she was pregnant-- with me. Either the tubal operation had failed after 7 years, or I just had my own ideas. Whatever the case, she ended up with three kids instead of two. The board was right!&quot;
