<b>UPDATE</b>
<br><br>
In August 2006 I received an e-mail from Michael Williams regarding this story:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I was reading the Ouija stories, and I read the one titled &quot;Spirit in Love.&quot; I don't know if the submitter knew it, but the spirit talked in Japanese:
<br><br>
Fred, I like you.......so far....as well.....<br>
Board: ARIGATOU
<br><br>
That means &quot;Thank You&quot; in Japanese, so they could have been talking to a Japanese spirit. Just thought it was some good trivia for your site or something the person should know.</i></blockquote>
