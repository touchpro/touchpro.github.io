On August 15, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kylie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Kylie, and I am 14 years old. You have recently put <a href="nic0709ouija.html">me and my brother's story</a> on your site. His name is Nic, as you already know.   I want to thank you for getting our story out there! ;D
<br><br>
In my brother's email to you, we told you about Sam! Unfortunately, Sam was a demon and we had to call on Michael the Archangel to drag him back where he belongs. The reason for the incident was one of the prayers on your site! In the second prayer it says &quot;Dear Spirit, as I sit with you now, I open my heart.&quot; When you say that, apparently you are opening your heart to everyone, including demons. Just be careful!
<br><br>
After that , we continued to use the board. We have still been having nothing but good experiences! We have been talking to all good spirits.
<br><br>
I decided to email you right away so my story happened about five minutes ago!
<br><br>

My friend Meghan and I decided to use the board for the second time in one day. It is okay to do so! We talked to many spirits, and got to a spirit named Sayde! She is so sweet! Here's how the session turned out:
<br><br>

Me: Hi Sayde!<br>
Board: Hi!<br>
<br>
Strange noise coming from inside the room.<br>
<br>
Me: Guys, only use the board please!<br>
Board: Sorry<br>
<br>
There was a noise coming from the closet.<br>
<br>
Me: Guys!!!!!!!<br>
Board: So sorry!<br>
<br>
The door handle on the closet door started to jiggle! I was so scared and my heart started to pound.<br>
<br>
Me: STOP!!!!!<br>
Board: SO SORRY!!!<br>
<br>
We then ended the session, said the ending prayer, and fled the room!<br>
<br>
This was one of the scariest moments in my life!!! I will admit, I started not to believe in the ouija anymore, but the spirits proved me wrong! So now, this is living proof to me and anyone who reads my story and believes me! Thank you again!
