On June 14, 2009 I received an e-mail from Alexis about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So it all began June 14, 2009. A few friends and I had gathered, just to spend time together. We had been reading over many Ouija board stories for the past few weeks and we were very scared, yet determined to try the board for ourselves. It was myself (Alexis), Michelle, Karina, and Jorge. We all decided to hang out and go over the Jorge's house. We stalled, laughed about some things from the past as we took advantage of the empty house. We watched t.v. for a little bit, then around 8:00 PM we decided to pull out our homemade Ouija board. We all decided to find a few prayers to say before and after completing the session...just to be on the safe side. We then all gathered in Jorge's room in a circle, lit a few candles, and touched knees. As I read the prayer, I had everyone repeat after me. They began to laugh because they said I was reading too fast. I was getting frustrated because I wanted to get right to it, I was excited to talk to ghosts!
<br><br>
Well, they decided they would be serious and insisted I say the prayer again. We all said it, and decided to begin. We, (Me, Karina, and Jorge) all placed both our index fingers on the planchette, while Michelle decided to record what happened. Karina decided to ask a question: &quot;Is anyone here who would like to speak to us?&quot; There was no response. She decided to ask again, this time with a much louder voice: &quot;Is there anyone here who would like to speak to us!?&quot; Again...no reply. Then Jorge stepped in and decided to ask, and being he was a boy, his voice was much louder and much more demanding. We all sat still. The planchette slowly started moving. We all looked at each other in shock. Jorge assumed we were moving it, and he was getting mad at Karina and I. Michelle sat to herself, shaking, afraid. We put less and less pressure on the planchette, and it continuted to move until it reached &quot;Yes.&quot; We decided to ask another question, but we got no response. We continuously asked questions, but the planchette no longer moved. We eventually went to goodbye and took up the board and put it away.
<br><br>
The rest of they day went by, and I returned home. We all were upset because it didn't work, and we figured it was all a waste of time. As I was in my room, I closed the door and turned my stereo on very low. I could've sworn that I heard my grandma calling me in the next room. Occasionally, she would get cramps in her legs being that she was diabetic and she was unable to walk. She would cry desperately and would always ask for my help. Well, that night when I was in my room, as I mentioned earlier, I heard my grandma, crying, basically screaming for my help, yelling in Spanish &quot;Please Alexis! Please come help me, I can't get up!&quot; So I got up as fast as lighting and ran to her room, shaken from her cry. As I peeked in her room, I realized she was sitting on her bed watching t.v., not the slightest bit in pain. She looked at me confused, and asked &quot;What?&quot; I asked &quot;Are you ok?&quot; She said &quot;Yes, why?&quot; Then I said &quot;Oh nothing, I guess I'm just hearing things.&quot;  I returned to my room. I was absolutely positive that I heard her, without a doubt, but I decided to put it aside and go to bed.
<br><br>
Throughout the night I couldn't sleep, the incident with my grandmother replayed over and over in my dreams. The next day, I remember I was laying on my bed talking on the phone, alone in my house. I noticed a funny smell but I didn't pay any attention to it. I heard a noise, as if someone was walking towards my room and my door opened slowly. I expected to see my little cousin Mica walk in my room because she always opened my door slowly in order to be sneaky, but the house was empty except for myself. I couldn't explain why my door had opened, but I was terrified. I continue to hear things around my house, I smell certain things that are unexplainable and I'm still scared. The Ouija didn't work, but I'm still experiencing abnormal things? I admit, I'm scared but hopefully it's all just in my head. Don't mess with a Ouija board if you aren't well prepared, even being prepared, you might open a door that could never be closed...
