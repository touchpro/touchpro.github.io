On July 20, 2008 I received an e-mail from Laura about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A few weeks ago a friend and I were interested in trying a ouija board for the first time, just out of curiousity. We have a next door neighbor who knows about spirits and everything that we didn't.  We convinced her to help us, and the only thing we needed to figure out next was where to go. Well, with a little research around our neighborhood we found out that the house across the street is haunted. Apparently, the husband and wife who used to live there both died. The story is that he went crazy, killed his wife, and then killed himself. Knowing this legend, we decided to go over there. And seeing as nobody lives there now and what we did might be criminal, I'm not going to disclose exactly what we did. Basically we got into the house that night, picked a room, and got started right away. Here's where it gets creepy.
<br><br>
We said an opening prayer of protection and warmed up the board. It took awhile to get started, but it told us that yes, someone was with us. It told us that it's name was J.J. and he was 7 years old. This suprised us all since we had only heard about a husband and wife. We asked it if it would like to tell us something. It spelled out H-E-L and we quickly thought it was going to spell HELL.  We heard that if it tries to spell a bad word, we should quickly just end the session. So we TRIED to do that. But I guess we were so creeped out that I accidentally knocked over our cursor, and one of the girls blew out the candle. We knew that was bad in itself, letting out the spirit (good or bad). We got scared and left right away.
<br><br>
After getting inside, we realized that we needed to go back and finish what we started. Most of us were scared to even go back, but we thought it was important enough.  So we took a few men with us, just to sit inside and help us feel safer. We went back...
<br><br>
It started off the same way, and we confirmed with the spirit that it was J.J.  Before we really asked it a question, it started off by trying to spell something: K-I-L-L.  The oldest person with us said she couldn't be inside anymore, and she took off. Nobody else stayed either.  The oldest will not go back with us still to this day, and we still hadn't finished anything that we started. Two of us left, and we went back the other night.
<br><br>
We did not go inside, instead we went into the backyard. A huge homemade shed with the door open was in the backyard, which we investigated.  When we walked up to it, I felt evil. We walked away to get started. We lit one of the same candles, which was white. The second candle was red.
We did not have our original prayer with us, so we made one up. We also warmed up the board...it went nuts from the beginning.
<br><br>
We asked if someone was with us, and it went between E and F. Then it went to G, then F, then towards G again, and back and forth like this. After it stopped, it went to all four corners of the board. Nothing much happened after that, but we said goodbye and still occasionally go back and try to figure out who we were talking to. If anyone knows what we can do or what might help, please contact me.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or information for Laura, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on.
