On October 27, 2007 I received an e-mail from Magda S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Last night on October 27, I was sleeping over at my friend's house with some of my friends. My four friends decided to play with the Ouija board. All of them have played it before, except for me. Even though they played it before, we weren't sure of all the things we should do to keep the game safe...
<br><br>
My friend Ashley asked if there were any spirits in the room, and the pointer moved to &quot;Yes.&quot; We started asking questions, and we learned that the spirit's name was Rich, he was a tourist from Austria but he died in the U.S., nobody knew about his death, and that he wasn't married but he loved someone. He refused to tell us how he died though, and he said that he would talk to us again on November 24th (but only if Becky was with us). Anyway, he told us that the girl's name that he loved was Jena, and that we were associated with her. We found out that she was Becky's English teacher! She was also Polish and had a daughter Frenchesca, just like she told her English classes. We were all &quot;Aww!&quot; and &quot;do you want us to tell her anything?&quot; He answered, &quot;I love you and I will always care for you.&quot; At this point we were seriously convinced that Becky was just messing with us. We decided to say &quot;goodbye&quot;, but the spirit said &quot;No, one more thing.&quot;
<br><br>
We thought that it would be another cute thing, so we waited and he wrote &quot;Kill her husband.&quot;  And we just started panicking. Becky started hyperventilating, and we all just shook... Nikki started telling him that we're teenagers and we can't just MURDER someone. He told us that unless we do &quot;He'll kill her next on Nov. 24th (the day after he said he'd talk to us again)&quot;, and he'd hold it against us. He wasn't making any sense so Becky asked him if it was in her daughter's room and he said yes. We knew for a fact that none of us were moving the pointer because we were all so fucking scared and the candles died out even though the wicks were still long and Ashley's shirt was rolling up in the back. Nikki knew that you shouldn't leave the spirit so we reasoned with him, but he said we couldn't tell the cops. In the end Rich told us that he would be mad if we don't save her. So we said we'd try to, and we said &quot;goodbye&quot; before anything else came up.
<br><br>
We took picture of the basement, and we saw orbs and tubes in every picture...
<br><br>
So the question is: what should we do? Could it be a prank or something? But we decided we weren't going to take chances...
