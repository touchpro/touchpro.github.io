The following people have gone over and above in helping me find many of the places featured on the site: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>My Parents</b> - My parents are always willing to stop at a few cemeteries whenever we travel, and they don't even complain!!  I'm sure they're thinking &quot;whatever did we do to get such a strange daughter&quot; :) I really do appreciate all the help they've given me with the site (and countless other things!)<br><br>

<li><b>Katy</b> - Although my sister isn't a big fan of ghost hunting or cemetery exploring, she still joins me on some of the outings so I have company.  She also took photos of the Alamo for me when she visited San Antonio.  I really appreciate all the help she has given me.<br><br>   

<li><b>Mike Hill</b> - Mike has sent me very detailed directions to many old, interesting cemeteries around Ross and Highland counties, as well as interesting information about these cemeteries.  Since I'm an expert at getting lost, I always appreciate great directions!  And I'm still overwhelmed by all the cemeteries he told me about...I can't wait to visit them!  We've already met up for one cemetery crusade, hopefully we'll meet up for more soon!  Mike is also the best unofficial site editor I have...he's always catching my typos and e-mailing me so I can correct them :)<br><br>     

<li><b>Mike McMaster</b> - Mike has been extremely helpful with helping me find Wood and Henry County cemeteries.  Not only did he drive me to twenty-one cemeteries, but he also shared a lot of information about the cemeteries and the area.  As if the high number of cemeteries wasn't enough, he also gave me a night tour of the Wood County Historical Center and Museum, which is located in the former (and very haunted) Wood County Home!  Mike was a fantastic guide, and I had a great time exploring cemeteries and the County Home with him and his wife!<br><br>

<li><b>Andy Greenlese</b> - Andy spent an entire day visiting cemeteries in Lucas County with me.  He is great at giving directions, and he also shared many stories and lots of information about the cemeteries with me.  We ended up visiting 18 cemeteries, even though it was extremely hot and humid.  And he got bonus points for not laughing too much when I got my foot caught in a fence, and fell flat on my face as a result! :)<br><br>

<li><b>Mark Stout</b> - Mark was the first person to tell me about the Mothman...in fact, that was the first discussion I ever had with Mark.  Mark is always willing to ride down to Southeastern Ohio with me to be a &quot;tour guide&quot;, and he is the only friend I can always count on to explore some of the more risky locations (areas where trespassing is involved!) with me.  Like I always say, Mark is the best!<br><br>    

<li><b>Greg Wells</b> - Greg and I met up on August 20, 2005 to visit several haunted places and cemeteries around Coshocton and Tuscarawas counties.  We had been e-mailing back and forth for about two years, so it was nice to finally meet him!  He was a great tour guide, he helped me find several interesting locations!  I can't wait until our next ghosthunting/cemetery trip!<br><br>

<li><b>T.C. Jeffreys</b> - T.C. shared some beautiful photos from Alcatraz with me to post on the site, including a few of the outside playground that I didn't have photos of.  I really appreciate her generosity!  Also, she spent several hours using the ouija board with me.  And if all this wasn't enough - in April 2006 she showed me around several Michigan cemeteries! I'm looking forward to future ghost hunting/cemetery trips with her.<br><br>

<li><b>Fred Vobbe</b> - Fred has helped me find several interesting cemeteries around Lima, Ohio...I am not very familiar with the area, so I really appreciate his kindness!  He also invited me to speak about ghost hunting at the Lima Host Lions Club meeting in October 2005...I had a blast!  I always enjoy talking about ghost hunting.  And as if all of that wasn't enough, Fred also put me in contact with Mike Carpenter at WLIO, Lima's NBC affiliate station, for a TV interview.  I look forward to working with Fred on EVP recordings in the future, he is a huge help to the site!<br><br>

<li><b>Marty Myers</b> - Marty sent me several great photos from cemeteries in Licking and Knox counties.  In addition, he has also shared many photos he has taken at abandoned buildings.  I really appreciate him sharing these photos with me!!  In addition to sharing all these photos with me, he also met up with me in June 2006 to go exploring...I'm looking forward to future cemetery and abandoned building explorations!<br><br>

<li><b>Chad Porter</b> - Chad sent me many great photos from the House of Nightmares.  The photos are terrific, and I really do appreciate him sharing them with me!!  In addition to sharing all these photos with me, he also met up with me in June 2006 to go exploring...I'm looking forward to future cemetery and abandoned building explorations!<br><br>

<li><b><a href="http://www.midwestlost.com" target="_blank">Tim Fox</a></b> - Tim has shared LOTS of information about Belmont County hauntings and history with me.  He's also an active message board member who has participated in group outings.  And if that wasn't enough, he has also shared some cool website code with me that I hope to use to improve my site.<br><br>

<li><b>Rob Philabaum</b> - Rob has shared lots of information about Western Pennsylvania hauntings with me.  He's also an active message board member who has shared lots of ghost hunting results with the group.  In addition, Rob has also participated in message board outings!  He has many great ideas, and I'm very glad that I met him!<br><br>

<li><b>Justin Huntsman</b> - Justin has been extremely helpful with tracking down and finding information about cemeteries in Belmont County.  He's an active message board member, and has participated in a group outing.  Hopefully he'll join us on many more investigations/explorations!<br><br>

<li><b>Matt Roberts</b> - Matt and I met up in August 2005 for some ghosthunting in Cincinnati.  He was a FANTASTIC guide, it's always nice to visit cemeteries and other places with someone who is familiar with the area.  Matt also shared a very interesting ouija board story with me to post on the site.  I really appreciate him taking the time to share it with me, I know he's busy working on his own terrific <a href="http://www.tmghosthunters.com" target="_blank">ghosthunting site</a>!<br><br>

<li><b>Doug Speer</b> - Doug is always sharing LOTS of photos and information with me about haunted places and cemeteries in South Carolina and Georgia.  I've visited some of the places he's told me about, but he's also sent me photos of many cemeteries I may never have a chance to visit.  I really appreciate all the help he has given me with locations listed on the site!<br><br>

<li><b>Tammy Ankrom</b> - Tammy is a very kind website visitor who met up with me at Maple Grove Cemetery in Mechanicsburg to show me around the cemetery's interesting gravestones.  She was a great tour guide, and I really appreciate her telling me about the cemetery!  I look forward to more cemetery adventures with her!<br><br>

<li><b>Mike Holmak</b> - Mike mailed me a CD full of terrific cemetery photos from New Jersey.  In addition, he sent me information about each cemetery.  I really appreciate him taking the time to send me all these great photos!<br><br>

<li><b>Adam Jones</b> - Adam is my #1 resource for finding information about haunted locations around Ross County.  He's been visiting my site since it was created, and he's one of the earliest site visitors that I still keep in touch with.  I have a ton of places written down on my &quot;places to explore&quot; list that are a result of my discussions with him.  One of these days  promise that I'll meet up with him to explore some of those places!! <br><br>

<li><b>Kari Brown</b> - Kari visited my site and suggested a few cemeteries that I should visit in Muskingum County.  She sent me <b>FANTASTIC</b> directions to the Carr-Ebenezer and Crooked Creek Cemeteries, and also told me about other places (like the Salt Creek Covered Bridge) that I should visit on my way to the cemeteries.  She's always sharing new directions with me, and one of these days I'll visit each and every place she's told me about.  She was also one of my first website visitors, and hopefully we'll keep in touch as long as the site is in existence!<br><br>

<li><b>Mark Jordan</b> - Mark told me stories about his haunting experiences at Malabar Farm while rehearsing the <i>Ceely</i> play.  He also took me to Olivet Cemetery...I really appreciate him giving up his afternoon to share these stories and visit the cemetery with me!  Mark has kept in touch with me since our Malabar Farm meeting in March 2004, and he's told me about lots of other haunted places to explore.  I'll definitely be meeting up with him for more haunting discussions!<br><br>

<li><b>Darin Wilson</b> - Darin sent me some beautiful photos of his ancestors' gravestones in Adair, Iowa.  He is the first person to send me cemetery photos from Iowa...I really appreciate it!<br><br> 

<li><b>Wes Flinn</b> - Wes explored Spring Grove Cemetery with me, and he also took me to the Harrison Tomb.  He was a great Cincinnati tour guide, and I can't wait to meet up with him for more cemetery explorations!  He gave up an entire Saturday to go cemetery exploring with me, a person he hardly knew.  He didn't even complain about all the time I spent trying to find at least one Indiana cemetery to include on the site :)<br><br>  

<li><b><a href="http://www.jkroninger.i8.com" target="_blank">Jon Kroninger</a></b> - Jon told me about the Cole-Stratford Cemetery outside Delaware County.  Had he not told me about this cemetery (and shared his interesting story about his experience there) I probably would have given up on finding this cemetery.  I appreciate his help, Cole-Stratford Cemetery has been one of the most interesting cemeteries I have visited!!  In addition to telling me about the cemetery, he sent lots of other interesting historical information about the town of Stratford.  This was definitely going over and above!<br><br>   

<li><b>Rob (and Max!)</b> - I was very fortunate to run into Rob while trying to find Cole-Stratford Cemetery.  This cemetery is VERY well hidden, and had he not helped us we would have probably never found it.  Plus, Rob and his beautiful dog Max were great company!  He told me about several interesting (and even a few haunted) cemeteries in Tuscarawas County that I hope to check out soon!  He gave up a good chunk of his evening helping two girls that he found wandering around an abandoned field...not everyone would do that!  In fact, some people would have just called the police!<br><br>

<li><b>The &quot;Spooks&quot; - Marilyn B, Jamie B, Cassie M, Derek Davis, Cassie P, and Carrie A.</b> - I met up with this group from the message board in October 2006 to go ghost hunting around Dresden.  I had a blast!  We visited a couple haunted cemeteries, as well as the Roseville Prison.  They're a great group of people to hunt with :)<br><br>

<li><b>Anthony, Paul, Parker, Alice, Lynne, and Jessalee</b> - This group visited Elisabeth's Grave with me at night AND helped me accomplish one of my goals - to use the ouija board in a haunted cemetery!  I really appreciate them ghost hunting with me, and I'm looking forward to many more hunts with them!<br><br>

<li><b>Kitty and Amy Goodburn</b> - Kitty, one of my friends from work, and her daughter, Amy, contributed many beautiful cemetery photos from their trip to Ireland.  And if that wasn't enough, they also took photos of a cool, old jail that they let me post on the site.  I really appreciate them sharing the photos with me :)<br><br>

<li><b>Karen Smith</b> - Karen, one of my friends from work, took several terrific photos at Reynolds Cemetery in Addison, Ohio for me to post on the site.  This was especially generous since Karen finds my cemetery fascination a tiny bit creepy :)  I'm going to turn her into a cemetery addict yet!  I really do appreciate her sharing these photos with me.<br><br>

<li><b>Heather Theado</b> - Heather told me about Job's Cemetery outside Pickerington, Ohio.  Since there's a housing development going up around this cemetery and Amanda-Northern Road is closed before getting to the cemetery, I wouldn't have found this cemetery without her help.  Heather has also told me about several other cemeteries in the Pickerington area, and she always keeps an eye out for other cemeteries I'd enjoy visiting whenever she travels.  I should also thank her for all the digital camera advice she gave me while we worked together, her advice has really come in handy for the development of this site :) <br><br>    

<li><b><a href="http://www.osborneonline.net/gallery2/main.php" target="_blank">Brian</a></b> - Brian e-mailed me about one of my Elisabeth's Grave photos that appears to have a face in it.  I'm terrible at noticing weird stuff in photos, so I'm glad he highlighted the suspicious area in the photo and sent it to me!  Also, Brian sent me a death certificate for one of the inmates buried at Whitegate Cemetery.  I really appreciate all of his help!<br><br>

<li><b>Kristin Stein</b> - Kristin sent me an old article about Mary Jane's Grave, which I was thrilled to add to the site.

She has also sent me many great cemetery photos from Tennessee, and has offered to send more for me to post on the site.<br><br>

<li><b>Denise Klipstein</b> - Denise has mailed me tons of great ghost photos from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area.  Her photos are some of the best ghost photos I've ever seen.

I really appreciate her kindness :)<br><br>     

<li><b>Tony Stokes</b> - Tony has sent me several photos from cemeteries and historical buildings around Fairfield County.
