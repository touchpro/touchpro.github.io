Hope you all had a great Christmas!<br /><br />I had a fun Christmas, it was a very busy weekend.  I spent Christmas day with my family.  We did the normal stuff - opened presents, ate roast beef for dinner, and went to the annual family get together with my mom's side of the family.  My parents got me a lot cool gifts.  I'd have to say my favorite though would have to be the &quot;Jackass&quot; calendar my mom found at Tractor Supply (they just love shopping there for stuff for their barn).  It's a calendar with jackass (donkey) photos.  The photos have captions like &quot;when I grow up I want to be an asstronaut&quot;, etc.  Mom thought it would be fun for me to hang up at work as a sort of statement :)  I'll be sure to hang it up ASAP on January 2 when I get back to work after New Year's.  <br /><br />Friday I went to a few cemeteries around Lancaster and Sugar Grove in Fairfield County.  I added the new photos to the site last night, you can see them by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>.  It was a gorgeous day, it was really bright and sunny.  In fact, the whole weekend was like that, and the temperatures were much warmer than they had been.<br /><br />Saturday my parents came up to my place to visit.  We had lunch and went to see <i>The Return of the King</i>.  It was awesome!!  I loved all three <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies, I don't think I could pick a favorite.  <br /><br />Saturday night/Sunday morning I took down the Christmas tree and all the other decorations.  It's nice to have my apartment back to normal, I'm not a big fan of Christmas decorations.  <br /><br />Yesterday afternoon/evening I went to a couple cemeteries in Delaware County (outside Bellepoint).  Both were really beautiful.  The first one, Mill Creek Cemetery, was back a quiet country road.  The cemetery had a low stone wall around it, and it was surrounded by lots of trees.  Mill Creek runs behind the cemetery, down a small hill.  The second cemetery I went to was Oller Cemetery.  It's on Riverside Drive, across the road from the Scioto River.  The cemetery is on a hill beside the church.  There are plenty of old trees, and the road kind of curves around the top of the cemetery.  When I saw this cemetery I had a strong feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  I know I had never driven by this cemetery or seen any photos of it, but it was EXACTLY like a cemetery I was wandering around in a dream I had a few weeks ago.  Too weird.  I think Oller Cemetery is the most beautiful cemetery I've been to so far.  I'm sure the gorgeous weather had something to do with it, but standing under the trees in the shade, looking at the sun's reflection on the river was breathtaking.  The photos I took don't do it justice, but I'll be adding them to the site later this week or the beginning of next week.<br /><br />But now my long weekend is over, and it's time to go back to work :(  Hopefully the week will go fast, at least it's only a 4 day week due to New Year's Day being a company holiday.  I'm guessing I'll probably hear about the job in Life Systems next week, my fingers are still crossed...I really hope I get it!<br><br>

Let me tell you, I am sooooooo glad I got my Christmas shopping done before today!  All the stores are crazy, I ran into the grocery store to pick up a few things and I was so stressed by the time I was done (remember, I'm not a big shopping fan even when it's not the holiday season...unless it's a flea market or antique store!).  Some last minute shoppers can be so rude and pushy!  I'm glad I went to the store tonight though, I can't even imagine what it will be like tomorrow!<br /><br />I was hoping to go to a few local cemeteries tonight, but that didn't happen since I ended up staying at work late...and because it was raining.  Right now it's snowing, those really big fluffy flakes.  Hopefully it won't snow too much though, I'd like to have a nice drive into work tomorrow - one without cars sliding all over the road.<br /><br />Ugh, I need to wrap a few Christmas presents either tonight or tomorrow.  My sister is always willing to wrap them for me each year, but I had a few items from eBay that I just got in the mail.  I won't have a chance to get them to her before Christmas so looks like I'll have to wrap them.  Oh well, I can take the jokes about my presents looking like they were wrapped by a three year old.  Yeah, I'm that bad at wrapping :) <br /><br />I got a newsletter tonight from the PA Travel & Tourism site I signed up for before this past September's trip to Uniontown, PA (my dad grew up there).  Reading through it made me realize that I'd really like to make another trip up there sometime next year.  Maybe next fall.  There's just so much history in PA and other East Coast states, I love that stuff.  Sure, Ohio has plenty of historical places too, but it's just more fun to travel to other states!    I can't wait until spring - that's the New Orleans trip.  Well, I'm really going down there for a cousin's wedding but my family and I are turning it into a vacation.  I can't wait to visit some of their cemeteries!  I was down there back in spring of 1997 for an open house when I was thinking about going to Loyola University, it just ended up being too expensive even with scholarships.  Anyway, I went to a cemetery then, but didn't take any photos.  Believe me, this time I'm going to take TONS!<br /><br />Well, I think I've rambled for long enough tonight :)<br><br>

You can tell it's the last few days before Christmas,  no one is at work and the few of us who are here don't feel like working.  Actually, I have a ton of stuff to work on, but it's really boring stuff...I'm still working on setting up our automated test bed.  I've processed 152 payments, 21 fund exchanges, and 63 withdrawals.  I have plenty more transactions to process, but my eyes are already dried out from staring at  the same screens for hours.  I can't wait until I'm finished with this stuff, maybe then the days will go by faster.<br /><br />I've had my headphones on today, listening to evil music of course (at least that's what a few of my coworkers call it!), and I must have had the volume turned up too loud because I noticed the little red voicemail light was lit up.  I checked it, and it was one of my coworkers who is out this week calling to see how the interview went yesterday.  I have no idea why she cares so much, it's not like we're friends.  This is the girl who is always giving me a hard time about the music I listen to, about my religious beliefs (or I guess my lack thereof), about using the ouija board, etc.  The same person who made me angry by putting on my walking shoes that I had laying under my side chair while we were still working downtown (I hated walking to work in my dress shoes) and walking up and down the aisles saying &quot;wow, look how big Beth's feet are&quot;.  Yeah, I know people usually accuse me of being too nice, but believe me...I've made it clear to this person that she gets on my last nerve.  So why would she call to ask about the interview????  I haven't really talked to her for a few weeks.  I just can't help but think she's trying to get me to say something bad about this area or our manager so she can run and tell him a distorted version of what I said.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I'm really not a paranoid person. <br /><br />Well, time for me to get back to work :(<br><br>

I just finished cleaning.  I should have finished earlier, but I took a break to check my e-mail/read blogs, then another break to talk to my dad about the interview, another break when my mom called (just because my dad told her I called while she was gone and she thought I called for her), and a final break to pull a splinter out of my food.  I tell ya, I'm cursed when it comes to splinters in my feet (this is probably the third or fourth time I've blogged about it!).   I suppose I could end that curse by wearing shoes when I go outside :)  Yeah, I know it's winter and not all that warm outside (it did make it into the 40's today) so I should definitely wear shoes.  But I was just running out on the patio for a few seconds to give the squirrels more corn so I didn't feel it was necessary to waste time putting on shoes.  At least this splinter wasn't very hard to get out, and it was a worthwhile sacrifice because the squirrels just love the corn.  <br /><br />Well, I think I'm going to go feed the frogs now.  I'll blog again tomorrow!<br><br>

I managed to get myself really worked up before the interview.  I got back from lunch at noon, and let me tell you...the hour wait until it was time for the interview was one of the longest hours ever!  Even the walk from the fifth floor to the second floor seemed to last forever.  And I got myself all worked up for no good reason - it was a pretty informal interview.  Both Rob and Jeff were there, they explained the job duties and the team's structure.  They also asked me a little about my experience with Mercury's QuickTest Pro automated testing software.  Neither had any questions for me since I had worked with both of them in the past.  I think the biggest concern was about how my current area would react about me being offered the job, if they do indeed offer it to me.  I'm not concerned about them putting up a fight....Honestly, I think they should just let me go without a fight, obviously I'm looking for something new, why hold me back?  But we'll see what happens, I should know in a week or so (they can't give me a definite time frame since the holidays have everyone's schedules messed up).  I really do hope I get it, I can tell this next week is going to be a long one! :)<br><br>

So tomorrow's the big day...the interview!  I honestly am nervous about it.  On my other interviews I sort of knew what to expect...the normal interview questions.  But this time I know the person interviewing me, so I'm not really sure if it will be formal, informal, etc.  Here's hoping it goes OK!<br /><br />I really didn't do much at all today.  I did a little cleaning, but I should have done more.  Oh well, I'll just finish it up tomorrow night.<br /><br />When I was looking for the preschool graduation photo that I posted last night I also found a couple funny Christmas photos of my sister and I.  They really cracked me up, so I'm going to post them:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/xmas82.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./miscpic/xmas83.jpg"></center><br /><br />The first one is from 1982.  The look on Santa's face is just too funny.  I HATED getting my picture taken so I'm crying in most pictures taken from 1-4 years old.  The second picture is from 1983, at least I'm not crying in that one!  Actually, I still hate having my picture taken, but now I just complain about it instead of crying :)  I'm sure Katy (my sister) will be just thrilled that I posted these on the site :)  Maybe I'll get lucky and she won't read my blog this week...if she does read it I'm sure I'll hear about this!<br><br>

I went down to my parents' house to help make cookies today.  But my sister and her boyfriend were there and were pretty much taking care of the baking, so I didn't end up helping as much with the cookies as I had planned to.  I ended up driving into town to wash the truck, it was covered in salt.  Usually I don't care if it's dirty, but there was so much salt on the side windows that I could hardly see out of them when the sun was shining.  There were a million people waiting to wash their vehicles and I ended up waiting for a long time.  Well, it seemed like a long time, guess I was really only there for half an hour though.<br /><br />I saw a really bad accident on the way back to Columbus tonight.  They had all three lanes of I-70 eastbound closed, and part of the left lane westbound was closed.  I tried not to look, but since I was pretty much stopped (even though I was headed west) my morbid curiousity got the best of me and I glanced over.  I wish I hadn't, the car I saw didn't even look like a car anymore, it was all smashed up.  And even worse, I saw a body covered up with a white sheet on the side of the road.  That has been enough to depress me for the rest of the night, I hate seeing things like that.  It always makes me feel so bad for the person's family who will be seeing the photos of the wreck for days and days afterwards, it would have to be awful.  The story is already out on the local news sites, it looks like at least two people died according to <a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com/news/2718814/detail.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.  It's just too sad.<br /><br />That's about all I can think of to write about this evening.  I'll try to blog again tomorrow.<br><br>

I just couldn't stand my old template anymore, so I decided to change it.  I'm not sure what I think of this new template yet...it doesn't fit in with the rest of the site, that's for sure.  It's a white background!  But in a way, I would like to have the blog look totally different.  I don't know, maybe I'll play around with it some more.  But not tonight - I took NyQuil an hour or so ago for my cold, and I'm starting to feel very sleepy :)<br><br>

It's been a super quiet day at work today...a lot of people took today off.  Even more people have vacation scheduled next week, that will be <i>really</i> nice!  All of our managers are gone right now, our division manager took the unit managers out to lunch.  I think the rest of us should just go home :)   Really, it's nice to have a day where I can write about work in my blog without complaining (even if it is just because everyone is on vacation)!<br /><br />I'm not looking forward to the drive home tonight.  The roads aren't too bad right now....but wait - there's snow on the ground so therefore we must drive like complete idiots!  I swear, all it takes is one drop of rain or one snowflake for people to start driving like total morons around here.  The drive into work was crazy this morning.  Some of the side streets and back roads were snow covered and slick, but the main roads were fine.  Ugh, I'm already complaining about the drive and winter is just beginning :(  I tell ya, I really miss working downtown and just being able to walk the mile to work.  <br><br>

This morning we had our quarterly department meeting.  It seemed to last for an eternity, but in reality it was only two hours.  I was relieved before the meeting...a few months ago our Systems Officer suggested that Shawn and I do a presentation on the new automated testing software we're using.  Luckily, he already had too many agenda items or something and we weren't asked to do a presentation.  I'm a pretty shy person in front of groups, so I had no worries before going to the meeting.  Towards the end of the meeting Mike, the Systems Officer, did a little ceremony of sorts to congratulate people on their accomplishments - like getting certified, etc.  He also presented the top four &quot;I Got Caught&quot; award winners.  I'm sure I've mentioned &quot;I Got Caught&quot; awards before so I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself - those are awards our managers give out when the &quot;catch&quot; us doing something good.  Since I just printed all of mine out to put in my portfolio, I knew I had received fourteen this year.  I figured that was about average.  Well, Mike announced the fourth place winner first...he had ten IGC awards.  That's when I knew I was in trouble, I was going to be &quot;singled out&quot; in front of the group.  Honestly, I hate being recognized at work like that, I'm not exactly sure why.  Turns out I was in second place, but yeah, I had to go up and accept the gift certificate in front of everyone.  Oh well, it was pretty painless...it's not like I had to speak in front of the group or anything!  Guess I'm just one of those people who like to remain anonymous and not have attention drawn to them.  But I'm not willing to do a bad job just to avoid the attention, I can stand a little attention if it gets me raises :)<br /><br />OK, on to my other issue of the day.  When I came back to my desk after getting ice this morning, I noticed a little card that said &quot;I Love Thee, Lord Jesus&quot; with a little gold manager pin on my desk.  I wasn't sure who put it there, but later found out that a certain person was giving them to people he worked with as a sort of Christmas card.  OK, before I even start, let it be known that I have nothing against Christian religions, afterall, I was raised Catholic.  However, as I got older I began to question the religion, and today I've rejected those beliefs...I'm not sure what I believe in.  All I know is that it's important to live a good life and to be decent to everyone.  So when I saw this card/pin on my desk I was a little...I can't think of the word I'm looking for.  Not really offended, just displeased.  Is it fair for this person who knows nothing about my beliefs to give this to me?  Shawn got one too, and like he said - what if he was Muslim or Jewish?  That card really might be offensive to someone of another religion.  I really don't care what people believe in, but I don't think it's right to give coworkers something like that unless you know they won't be offended.  And I don't think I'm overreacting since several coworkers agreed with me.  My area is pretty bad about stuff like that.  At last year's Thanksgiving potluck a coworker suggested saying grace as a group before we ate.  One of the managers said that probably wasn't a good thing to do, someone could go to Ethics if they were offended.  Another coworker than piped in and said &quot;We ARE going to say grace, I don't think anyone in here will care, and if they did care too bad!&quot;.  That statement really made me laugh!  Come on, what's wrong with saying grace on your own, why must the whole group participate.  It's a GOOD thing I'm not easily offended, I've had numerous religious comments directed at me personally that I could have easily used to get someone in trouble if I had ever gone to ethics - like the time someone told me I really needed to get to church for listening to &quot;evil&quot; music...whatever! <br /><br />On to some lighter stuff.  I updated the site with five new cemeteries today!  You can see the list of new pages by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>.  The <a href="frazeysb.html">Frazeysburg Cemetery</a> page contains a few photos of the coolest weeping woman statue I've seen so far:<br /><br /><center><img src="./frazeysb/frazeysb22.jpg"></center><br /><br />I'm not sure how many cemeteries, if any, I'll be able to make it to this weekend...remember, it's cookie baking weekend!  Maybe making cookies will help get me into the holiday spirit.  Like <a href="http://www.bluethrill.net/blog" target="_blank">Dave</a>, I'm feeling a little bah humbug-ish this year.  I'm sure I'll have a lot of fun Christmas day though, it's always fun to watch the wiener dogs play with their new toys (as you can tell, we don't have any young children in our family, so we have to give the dogs toys!).  My sister always gets her <a href="ratty.html">cat</a> toys, but she usually doesn't play with them - she's too busy giving the dogs evil glances and roasting by the fire.  And the annual family get together my mom's side of the family has that night is always fun too!<br><br>

I think I'm almost finished with my portfolio.  All I have left to do is copy some of my training certificates (I forgot just how many Nationwide Training classes I had taken within the past 3 and a half years) and my latest PE.  Oh, and I also need to copy a letter from our electronic new business manager thanking me for staying until 11PM one night to work on their stuff and the copy of the last (and only) peer review I've ever had.  I honestly thought it would take me a lot longer to throw everything together, I was a little worried about having it ready for Monday...but now I can give it to him before the interview!<br /><br />I remembered something that I forgot to write about this morning.  Yesterday afternoon my friend/coworker Michelle told me that Linkin Park will be coming to Columbus sometime early next year.  She wanted to know if I'd go with her, her oldest son (I think he's a freshman in high school, but I could be mistaken...he's around that age anyway!), and some of his friends.  She kind of wanted someone to go with her so she wouldn't be bored, and I guess I met the approval of her son and his friends...I guess one of Ronnie's friends refers to me as &quot;your mom's friend with the creepy website&quot;!!  That totally cracked me up :)  If she ends up taking them, I'd definitely go...Linkin Park is awesome, and Michelle is a lot of fun!<br /><br />Tonight I had to put gas in the truck again.  $1.32/gallon, not <i>too</i> bad.  I finished pumping my gas and was getting ready to get into the truck when I heard the short older lady at the pump across from me ask me for help.  I turned around, and she asked if I could get the cap off her gas tank...guess her husband or whoever filled the tank up last turned the cap too tight.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to help since I have mild carpal tunnel syndrome (my mom doesn't agree with me on the mild part).  However, I was able to get the cap off, it felt really good to help her out!  She pulled up to the pump shortly after I started pumping my fifteen gallons of gas (having a 28 gallon tank sucks!), I just wish she would have asked for my help sooner, it was really cold and windy out today.<br /><br />Well, I think I'm going to sign off and work on some website updates...I'm hoping to add five new cemeteries to the site this week.  I doubt I get them finished tonight, but hopefully I'll get them added tomorrow night.<br><br>

I meant to blog last night, but I didn't get a chance...I was too busy working on updating my portfolio :)  I have an interview this coming Monday!!!!!!!!!!  I can't remember if I wrote about it before Thanksgiving (I think I did), but a manager I used to work with approached me about an opening in his area.  So I think I actually stand a chance of getting an offer, but we'll have to wait and see.  I really hope I get this job though, I <i>really</i> need to get away from my current area.  I'm sure more positions will open up in other areas after the first of the year, I'm bound to find a new job eventually.<br /><br />Updating my portfolio as been kind of fun.  I had a bunch of e-mails and PE's that I hadn't read for years.  It was fun to go through them and read all of the nice things people said.  It brought back a lot of memories!<br /><br />Only two more days of work after today.  Saturday I'm helping my mom make Christmas cookies, that is always fun.  See, my mom doesn't quite fit the stereotype of a nice lady wearing an apron, measuring out all of her ingredients neatly.  Cooking at my mom's house consists of <b>lots</b> of swearing (mainly about their three dachshunds getting under her feet and tripping her!), and it's definitely not neat...in fact, it's very cluttered.  We make 7457943948 different cookies at once (OK, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit!), and it gets quite hectic.  But it's always fun, and it's not Christmas if I don't get to help.  I'm not sure what kind of cookies we're making yet...usually we make butter cookies, peanut butter blossoms, gingerbread wiener dogs (it used to be gingerbread men, but then mom found the new cookie cutter!), soft orange cookies, Mexican wedding cookies, buckeyes (everyone who lives in Columbus HAS to make these!), 3 kinds of fudge, and coconut bon-bons.  It feels like I'm forgetting something.  We already made the hard tac candy and cinnamon almonds.  Maybe that is it...but that's MORE than enough!<br><br>

Well, I've been sick.  I went to bed last Wednesday night feeling a little sick, but still thinking I'd make it into work the next day for the Christmas party.  However, I knew the Christmas party was out of the question when I woke up super early Thursday morning, I felt awful! I ended up calling in sick both Friday and today as well.  I'm feeling better now though, so I should be able to make it to work tomorrow.<br /><br />As if being sick wasn't enough, Sunday my dad noticed that I had a flat tire.  I had to get that fixed this afternoon, my parents were nice and went to the tire place with me.  So now Chuck (the truck) is all fixed.  Figures it had to happen so close to Christmas, I really needed more stress right now (and yes, I'm being super sarcastic!).<br /><br />Hopefully tomorrow will be a halfway decent day at work, it'll be weird to go back after being out sick for so long.<br><br>

The hurt foot that I was whining about yesterday is feeling much better tonight.  It's still a little sore, but it's MUCH better than yesterday, and it's even significantly better than it was this morning.  The bad news is that I'm still feeling pretty bad, worse than yesterday.  There's been a virus going around at work.  Hopefully that's not what I have.  I'll be upset if I miss work tomorrow because of it, even though I'm not super excited about the Christmas outing I hate missing work when I'm basically only working a half day.  Who knows, maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and feel better.<br /><br />Nothing too eventful happened today.  I worked on setting up the test bed for the automated regression test plan Shawn and I will be doing soon.  I don't mind setting up test beds because it's pretty easy work.  It does get a bit repetitive though and that makes for a rather boring day...and I've been doing it all week.  Last night I even dreamed about processing payments, exchanges, and withdrawals.  Talk about a nightmare!!!<br><br>

It's been awhile since I've blogged, hasn't it?!  These last few days have been pretty busy for me.<br /><br />Let's see...guess I'll start with last Thursday.  Having a half day off work was fabulous!  I had a great time exploring cemeteries in Dresden.  <a href="http://www.ohioghosthunt.com" target="_blank">Randy</a> took me to two really old cemeteries out in the middle of nowhere!!  Once we turned onto the gravel/dirt road we only passed one house on the way to the cemeteries.  I honestly would have never found these cemeteries on my own, I really am grateful that he showed them to me.  You can see the photos by clicking on these links: <a href="stmatt.html">Saint Matthew Episcopal (Old Stone Church) Cemetery</a> and <a href="stanley.html">Stanley Cemetery</a>.<br /><br />Friday was a half way decent day at work...the managers were at an offsite meeting all day, and the people who have a tendency to drive me crazy were either working from home or out on vacation.  Not too bad at all!<br /><br />Saturday I helped my sister set up her new computer (which we ordered from Dell before my old one crashed).  I think she was pretty excited about it, but not as excited as I was when I got mine.  She's not an internet junkie like me, she bought one so she could type reports and other class assignments, and to do research for those assignments on the web.  We all went to dinner later that night, it was a fun day.<br /><br />Sunday wasn't too exciting at all.  I cleaned house, and that's pretty much it.<br /><br />Yesterday and today weren't very great days at work.  Nothing really happened, just seems like this is one of those weeks for me to be terribly depressed about being at work.  It doesn't help that I'm not feeling so great right now, hope I'm not coming down with the flu or something.  <br /><br />I somehow managed to hurt my foot.  And with all foot/ankle injuries I get, it's my left foot.  I'm not sure what I did to it, but the whole left side of my left foot (the side of my pinkie toe) feels really sore, kind of like I broke or twisted something.  Can you even twist a foot?  Maybe I pulled a muscle?  I hope I didn't break anything!  When I got home from work yesterday it felt fine.  I had to run to the grocery store last night to pick up some bottled water for work (the water out of the fountains doesn't taste too great), and when I got back from the store I noticed it hurt  REALLY bad.  It doesn't really look bruised though...well, maybe a little.  I'm not sure what to do for it, it's not like they make foot braces (not that I know of anyway).  Yeah, I suppose I should go to the doctor and get it checked out.  I think I'll wait a few more days though to see if it gets any better :)<br><br>

I was reading my <strike>mom's</strike> <a href="ratty.html">sister's cat's blog</a> tonight, and noticed that Splotch said I always &quot;check her bowel&quot; when I'm visiting.   Hahaha, I think she meant to type the word &quot;bowl&quot;, that typo changes the whole meaning...I laughed so hard I cried!! :)<br /><br />I'm so thankful tomorrow is only a half day for me.  I know it's bad since I just came back from a four day weekend, but I really need this vacation time!  Both today and yesterday went extremely slow.  And today wasn't all that great, everything/everyone kept annoying me for some reason.  First thing that annoyed me:  if you want to ask me a question, don't just come over to my desk and stand there.  Knock, say &quot;excuse me&quot; or &quot;hello&quot;, etc.  I just hate it when people stand there and stare until I turn around.  Second thing:  if you know the meeting is going to last at least an hour, don't schedule a half hour meeting.  I have this weekly status meeting that's only scheduled for a half hour, but each week it lasts longer than an hour!  So update the meeting to an hour, that way people looking at my calendar will know where I am.  The third thing that annoyed me is related:  if we're meeting about a particular subject, don't bring up EVERYTHING that's going on in the area...if it's not related even a little bit, bring it up in a different meeting.  Especially if the meeting is only scheduled for a half hour :)  What am I on, the fourth thing?  Don't ask me &quot;What's wrong, you've seemed so glum and unfriendly the past few weeks&quot;.  Yes, I probably have...that's because my job is driving me crazy!  And no, it's not automated testing that's made me so &quot;glum&quot;...I love automated testing.  It's other stuff that goes on in the area that's causing my morale problem.  And like I always say, I'm not sure who reads this, so I'm not going to elaborate any further!!<br /><br />Here's hoping the first half of tomorrow goes by really fast!<br><br>

This "Columbus Sniper" stuff is pretty scary...and it's getting a lot of attention.  I saw <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/1000459.asp" target="_blank">this article</a> on MSN tonight.  I don't go over to that side of town too often.  However, my parents drive that stretch of I-270 every morning on their way to work.  Hopefully they catch this sniper soon, I'm sure it won't be easy though.  <br /><br />Today was just a so-so day at work.  The day went by really slow, I never thought it would end.  Last week I was approached by someone I used to work with in Life and Health Systems, turns out he has an open testing position in his area.  He encouraged me to apply for it, he even sent me the HR Req. number.  Here's hoping I get an interview.  I never thought I'd want to leave IAS and go back to LHS, but I think this could possibly be a good move.  I'll just have to wait and see what happens. <br /><br />I have to thank my coworker Karen for the best part of my day...she made homemade candy over the weekend, and today she brought in a bunch of it to share.  She makes the <i>best</i> coconut bon-bons.  Mmmmm, coconut and white chocolate, two of my favorite things! :)  <br /><br />I can't believe next week is our work Christmas outing...I need to go shopping to get a gift for the exchange.  This will be our second year to do the exchange.  You draw a name, then you have to buy a child's gift that reminds you of that person.  Then we donate the gifts to charity.  The person I got is pretty easy to buy for, but I should probably go shopping this week instead of waiting until the night before the exchange!<br /><br />Thursday I'm taking a half day off work to go to Dresden, OH.  No, not to tour the Longaberger Basket factory...I'm going cemetery exploring with Randy, the lead ghost hunter at the Friday night Prospect Place ghost hunts.  He sent me photos from the old cemeteries he's going to show me, they look really cool.  I'll be able to add at least three more cemeteries to the Muskingum County page, that will be really nice.   And now that I'm on the topic of site updates, I REALLY need to plan another ouija get together.  Maybe I'll invite everyone over to my place next week...I haven't updated that section of the site since the end of August!<br /><br />Tonight while I was sitting on the couch in the living room reading I kept hearing rocks hit the glass inside the aquarium.  I looked and noticed one of the cichlids (the big orange one) picking rocks up in it's mouth and then spitting them out.  I took a closer look and noticed that there is hardly any gravel behind the cave ornament now.  Wonder why it moved all the gravel???  There was plenty of room for them to swim behind it.  I think they just wanted to make the aquarium look bad, what horrible, mean, vile fish!<br /><br />Well, here's hoping for at least another halfway decent day at work tomorrow! <br><br>

First, a few photos:<br /><center><br /><img src="./miscpic/compaq1.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="./miscpic/compaq2.jpg"><br /><i>Photos of the new computer, which I have been spending a ton of time playing with :)</i><br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/xmas2003a.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="./miscpic/xmas2003b.jpg"><br /><i>Photos of the new Christmas tree, which is still standing...yay!  A tree that doesn't fall over!!  I still want to put icicles on it, but then it's finished.</i><br /></center><br />I managed to get the Fisher Catholic Alumni Association newsletter put together last night.  I sent it for review, I'm still waiting to see what they think, and to find out if I need to make any changes.<br /><br />I also cleaned the fish tank last night.  The cichlids, who used to be so tiny, are gigantic now.  I hate it when they move against my hand while I'm cleaning the tank.  Of course, it's worse when Mark and Kathy run into it, they're still much bigger than the cichlids.<br /><br />That's about it for now.  Maybe today will be more exciting than yesterday...if so, I'll blog again tonight!<br><br>
