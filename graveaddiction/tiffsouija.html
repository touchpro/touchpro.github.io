On April 23, 2007 I received an e-mail from Tiffany Smith about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I've used the ouija board a few times with my friends. I got it for my birthday last year. The first time we used it the pointer moved slowly and spelled out a lot of things that didn't make sense.  The weekend after, the spirit we were supposedly talking to was a boy my friend used to know who was shot.
<br><br>
Another weekend we used the board and my friend Charles talked to us (he died a few years before that).  We went to go show his sister...I don't remember much because it was a long time ago.
<br><br>
We started playing and we asked if he had a message for any of us.
<br><br>
Board: Christina (his sister's name)<br>
<br>
Us:  What do you want to tell Christina?<br>
Board: That I love and miss her.<br>
<br><br>
Later...
<br><br>
Us:  Do you still live with Christina?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Christina:  Where do you sleep?<br>
Board: Sometimes next to you.<br>
<br>
Other times we played and a boy who had died recently (Anson) talked to us often.  He once said that my boyfriend would call at 1 AM.  It was 1:08.
<br><br>
When Anson asked to talk to some of his old frineds, we brought them over and he answered questions that only one kid knew, and his hands weren't on the pointer.
<br><br>
My friend Melissa and I played, and the pointer kept going off the board...why is this?
<br><br>
I've had a few other weird experiences with the ouija board, but I don't remember many of them because I haven't played in a while. I lost the pointer somehow at my friend's house, and am waiting to get a new one.
