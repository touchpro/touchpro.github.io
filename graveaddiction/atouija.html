On November 28, 2005 I received an e-mail from Amanda Taylor about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br><br>
My friend Lynn and I were playing with her glow-in-the-dark board at my house. We knew my house was haunted, because besides the fact that it's over fifty years old and a couple people have died in it, things move themselves around. We started the session at approximately 11:00, and it lasted about two hours. We aren't very experienced with the board, both having used it only a few times.
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: [no movment]<br>
<br>
Lynn: We call any spirits dwelling within this house to the board.<br>
Board: [No movement]<br>
<br>
We got bored sitting there, staring at the board, and Lynn got a little distracted. There is a duck marionette hanging in my closet, and Lynn was staring at it. Then, she says &quot;Amanda, your chicken is funny looking.&quot; I replied,&quot;Lynn, that's a duck.&quot;
<br><br>
Right then the board started spelling. It spelt &quot;quack,&quot; so we knew we made contact.
<br><br>
Lynn: What's your name?<br>
Board: 666<br>
<br>
Lynn: Satan doesn't have time for us, tell us your name.<br>
Board: 666666666666666 [repeatedly until we moved the planchette]<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: Satan<br>
<br>
Me: I don't believe you, tell me your real name.<br>
Board: Dug<br>
<br>
Me: Your name is Doug?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you Doug?<br>
Board: 10<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: Mum<br>
<br>
Me: Did your mom kill you Doug?<br>
Board: Numyourkv
<br>
Lynn: It's ok if you don't want to tell us.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
The planchette began making a giant circle around the board and moving inward, like a spiral, and Lynn was staring at the flame (on the candle) and she started humming a really eerie song. After a couple minutes of the planchette moving in a circle and Lynn humming, I began to get annoyed.
<br>
Me: Lynn, stop it.<br>
Lynn: [looks up at me smiling and stops humming]<br>
<br>
Me: Lynn, what are you doing?<br>
Lynn: [eyes start rolling back in her head and her smile starts fading]<br>
<br>
Me: [realizing what is happening] Oh my gosh, LYNN! [I started to go toward her so I could smack her to try to get her to snap out of it, but... I guess whatever it was didn't want trouble.... Soooo.... Lynn's eyes returned to normal and she looked at the board.<br>
<br>
Lynn: Oh. It stopped moving.<br>
Me: Lynn, what were you just doing?<br>
Lynn: I was sitting here and watching the board....<br>
Me: What were you doing Lynn??<br>
<br>
Lynn looked at me, as though I were the crazy one, and says, &quot;What was I doing?&quot; In an extremely sincere tone of voice.
<br><br>
We touched the planchette again and started speaking with the board.
<br><br>
Me: Doug, did you do that?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: That was not funny Doug!<br>
Board: Yesv
<br>
Then I thought that Lynn was just messing with me... So I devised a question she didn't know the answer to.
<br><br>
Me: Doug, what is my password to myspace?<br>
Board: [spelt out my password]<br>
<br>

Well, the rest of the night we were just talking with him, and then he let us talk to Jade (The one we were trying to talk with the entire night)
