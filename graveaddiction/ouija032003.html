On March 19, 2003 I planned a &quot;contact the dead&quot; party with Amanda, John, and Ryan.  This was our first time using the antique 1920's Ouija board.  
<br><br>
We used the board for about one hour and thirty-three minutes, and during that time we talked with several spirits.  I left my digital recorder on while we were using the board, so I have the exact questions we asked.  Here are the answers we received:
<br><br>
Beth: Is anyone in the room with us?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Ryan: Who are you?<br>
Board: Harold (<i>Harold is my great uncle's name...he just died in September, 2002</i>)

<br><br>

Beth: Is it OK for us to talk to you?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Ryan: Is there anything you want to tell us Harold?<br>
Board: Yes 

<br><br>

Beth: What do you want to tell us?<br>
Board: Rest

<br><br>

Ryan: Are you resting where you are?<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

Ryan: Why aren't you resting?<br>
Board: Farm

<br><br>

Beth: Are you worried about the house?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Ryan: Why didn't you talk to anyone when you were alive?<br>
Board: Dale (<i>Dale is my grandfather, Harold's brother</i>)


<br><br>

Beth: Is it because of the fight you had with your brother?<br>
Board: Yes


<br><br>

Beth: What was the fight about?<br>
Board: Land and mom


<br><br>

Beth: What about your mom?<br>
Board: I took care


<br><br>

Ryan: Did you take care of your mom?<br>
Board: Yes


<br><br>

Beth: You thought the land should be yours because you took care of her?<br>
Board: Yes


<br><br>

Amanda: Is Beth moving this?<br>
Board: No


<br><br>

Ryan: Should we be talking to you, is this dangerous?<br>
Board: Yes


<br><br>

<br><br>

Ryan: What's your last name?<br>
