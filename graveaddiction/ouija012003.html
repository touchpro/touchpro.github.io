John and Ryan came over to drop off John's carpet cleaner. We talked for awhile, and as they were getting ready to leave they spotted the Ouija board that was still laying on my table from the time Chrissie and Susan came over. So we decided to try it out. John played with Ouija boards a lot while he was in school, and he has experienced some pretty strange things. Ryan had never played with one, and my only experience wasn't too exciting.  I really wasn't expecting anything interesting to happen, but I was wrong!
<br><br>
The first few questions we asked didn't get any response. We were going to give up, but John and I decided to try one more time...and nothing happened. Then Ryan joined in again, and this time the message indicator moved. Here are the answers we received:
<br><br>
Q: Is the person (spirit) who has been moving things around the apartment in the room?<br>
A: Yes

<br><br>
Q: What is your name?<br>
A: Maude

<br><br>
Q: Why are you here?<br>
A: Tableskirt

<br><br>
Q: Why is the tableskirt special?<br>
A: We made it

<br><br>
Q: Who did you make it with?<br>
A: Carrie (<i>note:  I'm still not sure who Carrie is, but from looking through cemetery records she could be either my great grandma's sister or cousin</i>)


<br><br>
Q: Do you like us using the Ouija board?<br>
A: No


<br><br>
Q: Will you harm us?<br>
A: No

<br><br>
Q: Are you afraid someone else will harm or deceive us?<br>
A: Yes

<br><br>
Q: Is your spirit at peace?<br>
A: No

<br><br>
Q: Why not - do we need to find something?<br>
A: Yes

<br><br>
Q: What do we need to find?<br>
A: Ring and letter

<br><br>
Q: Where are they?<br>
A: Porch and upstairs

<br><br>
Q: Is the letter about a forgotten relative?<br>
A: Yes (<i>note: there was a bit more detail, but since it's about family stuff I'm going to keep it vague!</i>)

<br><br>
Q: Will your spirit be at peace when we find these items?<br>
A: Yes

<br><br>
Q: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?<br>
A: Thanks (then it spelled out the word &quot;bye&quot;)

<br><br>

I thought my mom may have told John and/or Ryan my great grandmother's name and the forgotten family member, etc but they swear she never did (she works in the same area they work in). We called her and she also said that she didn't tell them. All of us swear that we weren't moving the indicator. And unlike the <a href="ouija122002.html">last time</a>, the message indicator moved quite fast. I will be honest and admit that I did have a little trouble sleeping that night!

<br><br>
My parents did find a letter a few days later that was in some file cabinets that came from the upstairs room of my great uncle's house.  It did contain some information about the family member, which really freaked me out!  Maybe we really were talking to my great grandmother!
