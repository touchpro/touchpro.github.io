On May 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Willemjan Kieffer about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Since my last incident with an ouija bord (Inferno and Ice) I hadn't touched it again.  But a few weeks back, I went out with another group of friends and some of them slept at my place.
<br><br>
The next day we sobered up (we all drank a little to much :-) ) and we decided it would be nice to go to a lake a few kilometers from my house with some tents. The following week myself, two other guys, and three girls (including my
girlfriend) went to the lake with three tents. Well, you can imagine what we did...we started drinking. I, for some reason, had the strange idea to take the ouija board with me.
<br><br>
So I said &quot;let's play with the ouija board.&quot; So we did. We started at 23:30, and at about 00:30 we still hadn't made any contact.  The other boys and girls stopped and went drinking, but my girlfriend (Alexandra) and I continued playing, saying that if we didn't make any contact at 01:00 we would stop too.
<br><br>
At about 00:50 we finally made contact with a ghost. We asked for his name, and he said his name was Yuri. We asked if he was from East Europe or something, and he said yes, that he was from Ukraine. We asked if he had anything to say. He said yes, do not go swimming tonight. When we wanted to ask anymore, he would awnser. So we stopped and we went back to our tent ;-)  But then we heard screams. When we went to check it out, the others went swimming and one of them was drowning!  We managed to get him to the shore, and he survived but he still has nightmares about that moment. Alexandra and I didn't talk about this experience with anyone.
