On March 1, 2006 I received another e-mail from Anton about his second interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I was with two other people and we used letters and numbers arranged in a circle this time.  There was Me (Anton), Jason, and Erica.  I didn't record or make notes of this seance but I remember it well...
<br><br>
So, we were at Erica's house and we were totally bored.  Erica's parents had the alphabet and numbers on little squares of paper for when they did seances.  No opening prayer of protection this time...The spirit was named Adrian and he came because he knew Erica.  I felt really uneasy with his energy, but it wouldn't move fast without me touching it.  <i>He had died about 6 months before in a motorcycle accident, I remember him because he lived around the corner from me.</i>  Anyway he and Erica were talking the usual ouija chatter and I asked, &quot;Adrian, do you have a message for me?  You know I used to see you around a lot.&quot;  Adrian immediately spelled &quot;F**KOFFU&quot;  I was shocked and asked why!  The glass started flying around so fast, I could feel that it wasn't good.  He then spelled &quot;HATEHATEHATE&quot;  And I'm like &quot;Whaaat?&quot;  The message continued: &quot;IKILLUF*CKR.&quot;  Jason, who was very quiet during the seance (<i>He was really scared as he had absolutely no belief in God or anything spiritual prior to this</i>), asked &quot;Why are you being so mean to him?&quot;  Thankfully that stopped the horrible message and Adrian spelled &quot;HELOVESJESUS.&quot;  At this I took my hands off the glass and sat back in the couch and said &quot;I am not doing anymore.&quot;  Erica and Jason decided to finish up too as they were a bit shaken by the sudden outburst from the spirit.
<br><br>
Now here comes the scary part.
<br><br>
I was roomies with Jason, and we left Erica's house about 1pm in the morning and went down the road to our house.  I felt really strange like psychosis, and I felt like I was not in control of my body like disassociation.  I got home and immediately sat on my sofa in my bedroom and for some reason put my hand under the cushion...there was this really ancient knife with a gnarled wooden handle, I had never seen it before, never.  I was horrified that involuntarily I started slicing huge lines into my arms and I couldnt stop it or control it...I was possessed or something.  Jason knocked on my door as he was worried about me after the seance.  Anyway he came in and was like &quot;what the f*ck&quot; and snatched the knife off me, and at that point I came to my senses and burst out crying and tried to explain what was happening to me.
<br><br>
That night after I went to bed I couldn't sleep.  The spirit was in my room and I could feel it moving around and touching me, and it's energy was strong and sickly.  Eventually exhausted, I fell asleep and felt fine in the morning except for my sore arms and a deep fear of ouija.  I didn't do another seance for 11 months after that...I should have learned my lesson, but no!&quot;
