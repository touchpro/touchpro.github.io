On October 20, 2007 I received an e-mail from Stephanie H. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me and about seven of my friends went to the park and played the Ouija board.  I talked to my Grandpa, whom I was very close to! Here is the story.
<br><br>
Us: Is there anyone who is with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is my Grandpa here with us?<br>
Board: Yes ( I started to get very excited, yet emotional)<br>
<br>
Me: May I please talk to him?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, Papa is this you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Just to make sure this is you, what was the nickname you used to call me?<br>
Board: S-T-E-P-A-N-I-E (Ste-P-anie in stead of Ste-PH-anie...It WAS my nickname, and I started crying and my friends asked if that was it and it was.)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you happy now? Are you With Aunt Roslin (my mom's sister who died when my mom was 16) and Luck and Tigger (our Dogs)?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Did you hear everyone when they were talking to you when you were in a coma before you died?<br>
Board: Yes (at this point I was sobbing)<br>
<br>
Me: Did you hear my speech at your service? (I was the only grandchild out of 16 grandchildren to read a speech, and the last to see him)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
My friend's little 10 year old cousin said: And is the meteor in 2021 gonna hit earth and wipe out the entire human race?!?! (We all stood silent looking at him funny, which gave me a good laugh).<br>
Board: (It even took my grandpa some time to respond cause I think he was laughing too)  No<br>
<br>
Me: I just want to let you know that everyone loves you and misses you, so if you can, could you enter in Grandma's, mom's, and my dreams to tell us you're ok?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: And could I ask you to make sure...what was the song I used to sing to you?<br>
Board: BaBa Black Sheep (Which made me cry even more!)<br>
<br>
Me: OK Papa, I just want to let you know I love you and miss you, but I'm happy you're ok.  I got to go now, and maybe my next Ouija board session we could talk, ok?<br>
Board: ok<br>
<br>
Me: I love you and miss you, talk to you later.<br>
Papa: I LOVE YOU<br>
<br>
Me: Bye<br>
Papa: GOOD BYE<br>
<br>
It made me sad, but it felt good to know that he was ok, and that night I didn't dream about him...but my mom and grandma sure did. I love and miss my papa, and I know I will talk to him again! I LOVE YOU PAPA!!
