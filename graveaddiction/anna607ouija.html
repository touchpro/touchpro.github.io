On June 16, 2007 I received an e-mail from Anna about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ellie and I were using the ouija board and the spirit said its name was Kassidy. She was 14.
<br><br>
Us: Is there anything you want to tell us, Kassidy?<br>
Board: Always get cum<br>
<br>
Us: *laughing in disbelief* Are you joking or, like, are you serious?<br>
Board: Yes (joking)<br>
<br>
Us: Oh yeah, we were going to ask for a number to call. Do you want to give us a number to call?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Okay, give us the number.<br>
The board gives us a number with I think way too many 2's...<br>
<br>
Us: Whose number is this?<br>
Board: Me<br>
<br>
Us: This was your number?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Was this your cell phone number?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Was this your home phone number?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Does your family still live there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Does your mom?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Does your dad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: So when we call this number, who should we ask for?<br>
Board: *starts spelling Kassidy*<br>
<br>
Ellie and I are really scared of what's going to happen at this point, but we call the number. It doesn't work. It's not a real number.<br>
<br>
Us: Was that the right number?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Did it have too many 2's?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do you want to try again?<br>
Board: Yes *gives us a new number*<br>
<br>
Us: Do you want us to put it on speaker?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We call the new number and a recording says that the number has been disconnected.<br>
<br>
Us: Is that all you needed to hear?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: We're sorry. We really would have talked to them for you...<br>
Board: Yeah, thx<br>
<br>
I wish it had worked. I think it would have been really cool if someone actually answered and we were able to talk to the father of a 14 year old girl name Kassidy who had died. Would have really made a believer out of me!!
