On May 16, 2003 Christian, Don, John, Karen, Mike, Nancy, Ryan, and myself used the Ouija board outside of my great grandparents'/great uncle's old abandoned house.  Jim built us a small fire, so we used the ouija board by firelight!  Obviously not all of our hands were on the planchette at the same time.  Jim and Katy watched.  The session ended a little after 51 minutes and 53 seconds when the planchette stopped moving.  This session marked the third appearance of Dug Hole...he even gave us his &quot;real&quot; name this time ;)
