On June 30, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kirstee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I stumbled on your ouija site and I thought I'd send you the story of what happened to me and three other people when we played the board in an old block of flats.
<br><br>
I was with my friend Missy, her cousin Roxy, and a guy called Brendon.
<br><br>
Us: Is any one there, can someone contact us?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Us: What's your name?<br>
Board: Jack, you (it actually just pointed to the letter u, we gave it our names)<br>
<br>
Us: How old are you, Jack?<br>
Board: Sixteen<br>
<br>
(We told the board how old we all were: 14, 14, 15, 14)<br>
<br>
Board: Good, Close the door<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Door<br>
<br>
(Missy was just recording the messages, so she got up and closed the door, as she did all the blinds slammed down)<br>
<br>
Us: What was that for?<br>
Board: See Inside<br>
<br>
(We thought he meant people passing by could look in at us and he didn't like that)<br>
<br>
Us: So how did you die?<br>
Board: Bang<br>
<br>
Us: With a gun?<br>
Board: tniop knalb  (we worked it out - it meant point blank)<br>
<br>
Missy: How old were you when it happened? (I don't know why she asked this)<br>
Board: 18................16<br>
<br>
(We all got scared then because it had changed it's story)<br>
<br>
Us: Goodbye<br>
Board: Hello (the pointer started spinning back and forth)<br>
<br>
(Missy and tried to open the door, but we couldn't...it was jammed shut.  Then she tried to raise the blinds, but they wouldn't move either)<br>
<br>
Board: We're friends right?<br>
Brendon: We need to go now.<br>
<br>
Board: Hush, Jack loves you<br>
Brendon: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Board: Don't tell, I didn't tell when you smashed the doll's house<br>
<br>
(There was a long pause, in which Missy and I calmed down a bit...we were the cowards of the group)<br>
<br>
Board: Poor ole Ray, bang 25<br>
<br>
(there was another pause)<br>
<br>
Roxy started coughing and scrathing her throat.<br>
<br>
Board: Drown her. (Roxy seemed ok again) I did.<br>
<br>
At that point the door opened and we ran like hell.  We went back to get the board the next week, and found it balanced on top of a door as we came in - in the same way people balance buckets of water they want to tip over. I haven't played since.
