On December 18, 2005 I received an e-mail from Aaron Arnett about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
When I was a teenager (about 20 years ago) we played with the ouija board for awhile.
<br><br>
On time we took the board to a cemetery around 1 AM and played around with it, sitting on gravestones. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until we headed for home. I was driving, my friend Brian was in the passenger seat next to me, and my best friend Pete was in the back seat holding the board in his lap - the board was sitting on top of the box. Right after we left the cemetery it started to rain pretty hard. Pete got a bad headache and just wanted to get home.  It's funny, the last time we messed around with the board Pete got a bad headache.  So he was starting to rethink his association with this thing.  Not even 5 minutes down the road I heard a snapping sound come from the back seat and Pete started freaking out and yelling.  He was yelling &quot;Holy Shit, Oh my god!&quot;  He was like &quot;Roll down the window, roll down the window!&quot; So Brian rolled it down (in my 2 door '76 camaro), and Pete threw the board
and the box out the window. He said the board snapped in half while he was holding it in his lap.
<br><br>
Now on another occasion, while I was staying the night at another friend's house, we were playing with the board
and the spirit we were talking to started to insult us so we broke the board. Well, the board didn't just snap in half, we had to bend it back and forth, back and forth until it finally  tore in half. I haven't seen a current board in a long time, I don't know what they're making them of now, but this one was just heavy cardboard like any other board game.  Anyway, so when I heard the snapping sound and Pete swore that's what happened, we knew something else made that board snap.
<br><br>
I dropped Pete and Brian off at Pete's house, Brian lived right behind Pete with his mom. It was still raining pretty hard. I went home.  The next morning I had to get up at around 7 AM to be at work by 8:00, it was Sunday. I worked at a restaurant, in the bakery every Sunday.  Around 10 or 11 in the morning Pete came in to see me (Pete also worked at the same restaurant - we were 16, didn't every 16 year old in 1986 work in a friggin' restaurant???). Anyway here's
the best part of the story. He's like &quot;Hey what's up?&quot, blah, blah, blah.  Then he asked me if I noticed
anything strange at my house in the morning before I left for work. I said &quot;No, I just jumped in my car (half asleep) and came here.  Why?&quot;  He said &quot;Dude, you're not gonna believe this shit...but when I came out to get
in my car today, the top part of the ouija board box was sitting on the hood of my car, and it was all rainsoaked!&quot;  I'm like, &quot;No way! You're messing with me, right?&quot; He was pretty freaked out.  We figured Brian, who was with us, would have been the only person able to do it since he was with us. But if you knew Brian, you would know like we did there's no way.  Even if he knew the exact spot where the board was thrown out of the car, it was raining like a bitch. Brian wouldn't have gone to that much trouble to get that wet (Brian spent a half hour every Saturday night doing his hair, like a girl).
<br><br>
So I finished my shift and went home. By the time I got home I wasn't even thinking about the ouija board.  As I pulled into the driveway my mom was pulling the garbage can out to the curb for the morning garbage pickup. Right before I went into the house, my mom called out to me. She asked me if I needed this, and held up the bottom part of the ouija board box. She found it laying by the mailbox. It was still wet from the night before, I must have left for work that morning and not noticed it laying there.  Mine and Pete's houses were both about 5 miles from where Pete
threw the board out of the window. I'm like, &quot;No, just throw it away!&quot;
