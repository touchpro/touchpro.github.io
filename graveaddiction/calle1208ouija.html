On December 31, 2008 I received an e-mail from Calle about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Calle, and I am 14 years old. My ouija experience happened on February 3, 2007 when I was 12.
<br><br>
My dad had been telling me about the ouija board for a long while, saying that we should buy one. I didn't know much about them, except what I had heard on ghost shows and on Coast to Coast radio. So I started talking to my friends about them. They are very Christian, and they told me that the ouija board is a sin and witchcraft, which is said to be bad in the Bible. I didn't care.
<br><br>
One day while my dad and I were in Wal-Mart, I just happened to see a Ouija Board in the game section. I started laughing, seeing this board in the family game section, but I got my dad to but it anyway. We just happened to run in to my very Christian friends at the store, who started telling me not to buy it. Being so stubborn, I didn't listen and went home with the board.
<br><br>
My dad and I waited until 10:45 PM, and then at that time we lit a fire in the fireplace, a few candles, and sat down at a table.
<br><br>
The first couple of minutes, we both couldn't stop laughing at what we were doing. After we got a grip on ourselves, we were able to sit there quietly and ask a question without laughing. The whole story went like this, exactly.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits in our house?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(I was slightly confused)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do we know who you are?<br>
Board: Yes/No<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: Tim<br>
<br>
(I was confused, but at that time my dad was a little shaken)<br>
<br>
Dad: Are you Time Seadon?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(The story is that Tim was a friend of my dad's, years before I was even born. Tim had come to my dad's house one day asking if he could live there with my dad. Tim was a huge druggie, and my dad said no. The next day my dad happened to see an article in the paper that said a guy named Tim Seadon had shot himself in the head while driving his car. My dad had been so shaken, he didn't go to his funeral, thinking he was the reason Tim had killed himself)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you happy?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Dad: Are you mad at me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you miss your life?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you wandering the Earth?<br>
Board: Lost<br>
<br>
Me: Can you go to Heaven?<br>
Board: Lost<br>
<br>
Dad: Can we help you?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Board: God<br>
<br>
Dad: Do you want us to pray for you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(The next question has to do with our old clock that we have in the living room. It hasn't been wound up for 6 years, but sometimes it gongs at random times, like 6:12)<br>
<br>
Dad: Are you the one who makes the clock gong?<br>
Board: Yes/No Bye<br>
<br>
During the experience, the fire would get higher at some points and the cats freaked out and ran out of the room. To make sure the other one wasn't moving the oracle, we both actually lifted out hands off it and it still went. I have tried it once more with a friend not long ago, but sadly nothing happened.
