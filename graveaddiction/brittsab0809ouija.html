On August 11, 2009 I received an e-mail from Brittany and Sabrina about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Sabrina and I wanted to play the ouija board one day because we were bored.
<br><br>
Brittany: Are there any spirits in this room?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Britt: What is your name?<br>
Board: sue<br>
<br>
Britt: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Then we continued on playing to find out how she died. She told us to never drink and drive = smart spirit. We asked her where Sabrina's necklace is, that she lost 9 months ago. She told us where it was. We found it.
<br><br>
~new game~
<br><br>
Sabrina: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Britt: Then leave. Goodbye.<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Britt: You have to leave.<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Do you have to tell us something?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Spell it out.<br>
Board: i am satan.<br>
<br>
At this point we are really freaked out. We had lit candles before we played, and they all blew out. The only thing you could see was the glow in the dark board. Britt (me) turned on the lights and went back to the board. The lights flickered, and a red lava lamp turned on. We heard the phone ring, so we picked it up to hear nothing. Then we heard breathing. We said goodbye to the board about 50 times, and the &quot;mystifing oracle&quot; moved by our touch to no. We flipped the pointer over and rushed into my kitchen. I was drinking water to calm myself down, and I started choking and couldn't breathe. No lie. Sabrina slept over that night, and it was the first night she slept-walked. I followed her all the way downstairs. She turned on a light and started to get down on her knees. It was almost like she was bowing down to someone. I shook her to wake her. We went back upstairs and barely slept the whole night. We are so freaked out that we never want to play again.
