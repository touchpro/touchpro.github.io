On January 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kayleigh about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I am writing to you about an experience I have had with a Ouija board. Actually, several experiences and with several different boards.  My friends and I often use the board, and it has successfully predicted events as well as spoken about past events.  I am writing to contribute to your list of stories, but I have a very important question.  Every time I play the board and anything about my on-again-off-again boyfriend Glenn is mentioned, it tells me he will die.  When we first began playing, it would just spell out &quot;DEAD&quot; when there was anything asked about him.  The more and more we use the board, more details are revealed.  It has told me that we would be married and have a child, that it would be a boy, and that in 2012 he would be killed in a car accident.  It explained that it is because he is a bad driver (which is true, he almost died in an accident several months ago) and would hit someone and be killed.  It also said the baby will be in the car, but will live. We have talked to several spirits and used several boards, and they all tell me he will die.  So, my question is: how much should I believe about this? Are spirits telling me he will die so that we get the relationship fixed, or will he really die? I am very scared of this and would like an expert's opinion.

If you have any advice for Kayleigh, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it to her.
