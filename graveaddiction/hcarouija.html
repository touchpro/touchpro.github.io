On July 29, 2006 I received an e-mail from Hayley Carmichael about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Today, at 3:30 PM, my friend and I decided to use my old homemade ouija board. We were in luck, or so we thought. As we browsed your site we read some of the ouija stories and didn't believe them when we read that a figure
of eight means the board was being controlled by evil!!! But I swear this is true.
<br><br>
(Lauren and Hayley's encounter with the board)
<br><br>
*Both of us* : Open the gates to heaven.
<br><br>
*Hayley* : Is there a spirit there?<br>
*Board* : Yes.<br>
<br>
*Lauren* : What's your name?<br>
*Board* : DW<br>
<br>
*Hayley* Are those your initials?<br>
*Board* : Yes<br>
<br>
*Hayley* : What's your first name?<br>
*Board* : Dave<br>
<br>
**(the planchette moved randomly to the letter H, then E .. then eventually was followed by a double L. we soon realized this spelled Hell)**
<br><br>
*Lauren* : Are you evil?<br>
**(the planchette started moving in a strange manner.  I (Hayley) soon realized it was moving in a figure 8 repeatedly)**
<br><br>
*Hayley* : What are you doing?<br>
*Board* : 8..8..8..8 EVIL<br>
<br>
*Lauren* : Are you an evil spirit?<br>
*Board* : Yes<br>
<br>
*Hayley* : Are you going to hurt us?<br>
*Board* : Yes<br>
<br>
*Lauren* : What are you going to do to us?<br>
*Board* : Rape..tonight...two<br>
<br>
*Both of us* : What does two mean?<br>
*Board* : Lauren and hayley<br>
<br><br>
**(We closed the gates in astonishment...after this I (Hayley) was to scared to sleep in my attic alone...I went downstairs and asked my mother if Lauren could stay tonight luckily she said yes)**
<br><br>
**Lauren collapsed in agony, writhing about the floor, eyes bloodshot, white as a sheet...I held her down trying to calm her.  That's when I realized she had a scratch in an eight shape on her neck. She stopped stuggling and looked at me worredly.  She pointed to my neck.  I looked in the mirror and was devasted to realize that I also had a figure 8 on my neck. It has not become clear to us if this was a symbol of rape, but we shall never cross paths with the OUIJA BOARD AGAIN!!!!!!!!
