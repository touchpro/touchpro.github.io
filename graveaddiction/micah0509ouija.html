On May 9, 2009 I received an e-mail from Micah B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I'd like to share a story about my first encounter with the ouija board.  Well, I'm 11 years old, and I played it with my 13 year old cousin, Zoya, and my Aunt Nicole.  We are all Christian, and I live with my grandparents.  That's where we were playing it, at my grandparent's house.  The board was on the dining room table where we were playing, and we started off just asking simple questions like how old am I, when was I born etc, etc.  Then I thought of a question in my head, well not on purpose.  I was thinking of a question to ask, then the planchette started moving to M-I-C-A-H.  That REALLY creeped me out, considering the fact that I never said anything. Then (I know your not supposed to do this) I asked it when was I going to die.  It said 7 years :( I'm not going to let this freak me out or anything, considering the fact that we might have been talking to a demon, which you will soon find out why.
<br><br>
Well...I know that this was a REALLY, REALLY, REALLY stupid idiotic, bozo head move, but we all got up to go make something to eat,and we left the board sitting open on the table with planchette sitting on the board.  All of a sudden I looked over at the table and the planchette started moving off the board, and then off the table.  And it didn't just fall down...no, it slammed down on the ground HARD, and it made almost like a booming sound.  I was scared shitless!  We put the board back in the box, took it outside, and put it in the trunk of my aunt's car.  We were going to go return it.  That is also a way of getting rid of an ouija board people, haha, just return it.  I don't know what we did to make it mad, we kept the questions simple and easy.  Well...it's someone else's problem now.  Did I mention that we had all the lights on?
