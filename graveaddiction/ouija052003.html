On May 2, 2003 Amanda and I drove down to my parents' house to have an Ouija session at my grandma's old house.  My mom agreed to try the Ouija board with us, and my dad and sister watched.  I had the digital recorder with me again so I was able to record our exact questions and the answers.  Here's what the board told us:


<br><br>
Beth: Are there any spirits in the room with us?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>
Beth: Who's here?<br>
Board: Estella (<i>Estella is my grandma, we were in her old house!</i>)

<br><br>
Karen: Are you happy?<br>
Board: Yes, dammit

<br><br>
Karen: Are you happy that I have your cedar chest?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>
Karen: Sharon took the picture in the front room, did you want her to have it?<br>
Board: Not really

<br><br>
Karen: Who should have had it?<br>
Board: You know

<br><br>
Karen: But I don't know.<br>
Board: Dumbass, you should've had it

<br><br>
Karen: Is grandma Smeck with you?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>
Karen: She's been trying to tell us where something is hidden, can you help?<br>
