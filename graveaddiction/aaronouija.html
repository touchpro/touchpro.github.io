On October 28, 2004 I received an e-mail from Aaron Park from Arizona.  He shared a very interesting ouija experience that he had with his friends Robert and Jacob:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This particular ouija session was one of the first experiences I had with the board. I can remember the night my two friends, Robert, Jacob, and I played with the board in hope of contacting our recently deceased friend, Shae, who was age 16 when he died. So, we went outside (it was raining) and up into our fort, which was built high above the ground. When we were all inside we lit a large, white candle and set it aside from the board. First I was asking the questions while my friend, Jacob was just playing.&quot;
<br><br>
Aaron: Can we contact Shae?<br>
Board:(moved slowly to S, then stopped)
<br><br>
Aaron: Is this Shae?<br>
Board: no.
<br><br>
Aaron: Who is this?<br>
Board: Z-A-Y
<br><br>
Aaron: Zay? Who are you? When did you die?<br> 
Board: E-V-I-L......1756.
<br><br>
<i>Realizing we couldn't contact who we wanted to, we decided to continue talking with Zay...</i>
<br><br>
Aaron:So, you're an evil spirit?<br>
Board: yes
<br><br>
Aaron: Why are you evil?<br>
Board: M-U-R-D-E-R.
<br><br>
Aaron: you murdered someone?<br>
Board: M-Y  T-W-O  C-H-I-L-D-R-E-N.
<br><br>
Aaron: Why?<br>
Board: A-N-D W-I-F-E.
<br><br>
Jacob:  Are you going to hurt us?<br>
Board: <i>starts moving very fast in an infinite symbol.
...(I remember someone telling me if the planchette
does that or in a circle, the spirit is laughing)
then the planchette stopped dead on the bottom left
picture indicating the spirit is there.</i>
<br><br>
Calming down, I asked: How did you die?<br>
Board: me
<br><br>
Aaron: you killed yourself after you killed your family?<br>
Board: yes
<br><br>
Aaron: So, you aren't going to hurt us, right?<br>
Board: moves fast again in infinite symbol then quickly spells out D-E-A-T-H.
<br><br>
<i>(Freaked out, we put the board aside. And I remember you're not supposed to take your fingers off the planchette until you end the session with goodbye)</i>
<br><br>
Minutes later we ask if ZAY was still there, it says
yes. 
<br><br>
I had to just ask:  You're not going to hurt us?<br>
Board: goes to NO but spells out M-E-S-S W-I-T-H
<br><br>
Aaron: You'll mess with us?<br>
Board: yes...we finally ended the session.
<br><br>
ZAY, although scary to talk to, is now one of our regulars. We just keep him in line!  Weeks after we continued to contact him in my basement, our stairwell light bulb went out once a week for like a month straight!&quot;
