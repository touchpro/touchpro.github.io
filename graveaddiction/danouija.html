On November 13, 2005 I received an e-mail from Dan Chong about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Now this is an account I had after I played with an Ouija Board. I was at my aunt's house with a few friends because I had to house sit for her. We were just snooping around a random closet and we found an Ouija Board! We were all really excited to play it so we just set it on the coffee table and crowded around it. One of my friends asked a question like &quot;Hello? Is anyone out there?&quot; and we didn’t get any response at all. We just left the board on the table and stuffed the planchette back into the box, and went out for food. Afterwards we tried again. None of us are religious and none of us believed in ghosts or spirits or anything like that. So we tried again and after asking a question, the planchette just kept wanting to move over to the dark moon on one side of the board. I thought someone was forcing it over but everyone seemed to be pretty surprised.
<br><br>
We asked who was there, and the planchette started moving to the edge of my side of the board. I heard it was bad luck or something to drop the planchette so I forced it to the middle again. I got fed up with the amount of time this was taking to start, so I just yelled, &quot;Damn it, if you're out there give us a sign.&quot;  A few minutes later the power went out. Probably a coincidence. My friend lit a candle and set it on the table for light. The planchette started to move over to the moon again. I looked into the mirror because I was bored from staring at the board for so long. I freaked out, I could have sworn I saw someone standing over me. I told my friends about it immediately and they all started to glance into the mirror but they couldn't see anything, and neither could I anymore. We started hearing banging on the walls, and the room got really cold, which I thought was pretty normal since it was winter. The wax that was falling off of the candle was black, and it was a totally white candle, and that creeped me out. I blew it out as fast as I could. We all thought it was really creepy so we all just got up and sat on the couch by the coffee table, watching the board. We all sat as close together as
possible, and we were all really cold. The power was out, there wasn't any light other than the moonlight, and it gave a completely cold atmosphere. We all saw the figure of a man shining in from the moonlight and we all got creeped out, huddling closer. The activity died down after that and we just left everything how it was and didn't clean up. The lights came back on and we all just went to sleep in the same room because we were creeped out.
<br><br>
The next day, I woke up first and went to the main room where we played with the board. I looked out the window, and it reflected the kitchen. I saw a really creepy looking old guy in the kitchen and I was like &quot;What the hell...&quot; I woke up my friends and we left the house, and cleaned up the board. My aunt returned to the house and died soon after, but we were never really close. People found her dead in the house while she was laying on the sofa by the coffee table due to a heart attack on the next full moon. I don’t think I’m ever going to go back to that house.
