		<div class="content">Mommy left me last night to stay with Beth the Brutal.  She explained that she had a late class and would be better for her to stay with Beth the Brutal than drive home.  Better for who, not me!!  Doesn't she know that it is fall and the windows are open and it gets COLD in the house for an old ratter like me.  Her mommy just told me to go curl up on the bed and get warm, I got no sympathy or understanding from her when I yowled.  She would not even give me a bite of cheese or ham off her sandwich.  Mommy should not leave me alone to fend for myself, to beg for food and warmth, to have to run from the elongated dogs rather than have her there to yell at them so I can flaunt myself in front of those idiot creatures from the underworld, and the worst thing, mommy's mommy is not generous with Pounces.  Oh Mommy, why did you leave me?<br /><br />Everyone was in a good mood this morning...the weekend is coming quickly.  Makes me glad I am Queen of My Universe, everyday is a weekend day to me.  But if my family did not work they could not buy me food and treats so it is a good thing that I have serfs to care for me.  Queen Splotches of Basil Rd.  Life is good.  Titles are good.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy is hoping for a bonfire tonight...yuck, mommy will probably think I want to attend and drag me into the great outdoors.  I really do not enjoy socializing with the inferior cats and bugs are NOT fun to play with.  Short-legged, long-backed, fuzzy debris catching dogs are not fun in the great outdoors either.  They seem to think I am a badger or something and try to hunt me.  Dumbasses, I am the Ruler, the Queen, do not snuffle me with that stupid snovel you stick everywhere and thank you very much, I do not appreciate your nose up my ass....those dogs are strange.  I do not smell everyone's butt, why do they think that is their duty in life.  Dogs in general are strange creatures and the spoiled rotten things I live with are the lowest of the low, in more ways than just their physical stature.<br /><br />Oh well, I suppose I have ranted long enough.  Sometimes a girl just has to vent, I mean this world is one fucked up place.<br /><br />Talk more later,<br /> the Ratty, the Ruler, Most Wonderful Cat Ever.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Ahhh, yes, I know it has been a while again.  Well, I am a busy girl, I am not here just to entertain the masses you know!<br />I love fall.  Cooler weather and open windows.  I can run from one end of the house to the next, leaping into and out of the window sills, startling people and mutant creatures alike, charging between their feet on my quest for a better window seat and feeling the pleasure that only making someone trip can provide.  Ahhh yes, fall is here.<br />The "boys" or those debris gathering, long-haired dust mops of the world, have been getting to go outside in the other world for long evening walks.  They group together by the door and whine, then take off running, snarling and biting, putting their noses to the ground all in the guise of being interested in the great outdoors.  I know the truth, those shit-eating creatures are looking for a fresh morsel of poop provided by the inferior cats or perhaps they are just looking for some other poop to roll in, doesn't matter, they are pretending to be mighty hunters of the groundhog or rabbit when really all they want is something that stinks to eat or roll in.  Gross creatures, why do the people in this house love them so?  I hear the family say the "doggers" make them laugh, that is their job...hell, I really work, I catch mice, well three in the nine years I have been here and there would be more but the mouse community has heard of my hunting prowess and stays away (the inferior cats think it is their doing because they catch lots of moles, voles, outside mice, birds and the occassional squirrel and they think that is why the house remains pest free but they are dumbasses, it is my doing alone).  I am a mighty hunter, no one is better, certainly not those rodents that call themselves dogs.  I am the only animal here that earns her keep.<br />Since I am a mighty hunter mommy thinks I can withstand torture and periodically she puts this to the test.  The other day I was holding my ear funny and shaking my head because, well because I wanted to do that.  She thinks I have ear mites so she grabs me and holds me in this vice-like grip and her mommy sticks a tube in my ear and puts this wet stuff in.  It tickles and trickles down my throat, it makes me want to run and hide, and the treatment definitely makes me growl and grumble.  Why does mommy do this to me and why do I think she will do it again.  For retaliation I have decided to keep her awake.  One morning I purred and cuddled around her head starting a 4 A.M. and last night I decided to start around 2 A.M.  So much fun, jumping on and off the bed, stomping all over the bed, purring or yowling in someone's ear.  She will regret messing with my ears.  She does it again and she will wake up with cat butt right in her face.  I know she really dislikes closeups of my butt first thing in the morning.  Perhaps a small fart would add just the right amount of payback.....will let you know.<br />Mommy's mommy was sick with a virus for a couple weeks.  She has not been her usual feisty self.  I mean she hasn't even been swearing much.  Hope she feels better soon, we need some excitment.<br />Well, got a few things to do, will check in again soon.</div><br>

		<div class="content">I've been bad about blogging.  Just seems my time is taken up by so many other duties.  Harrassing the mutuant dogs, belittling the lesser outside cats, stomping around my house to show my displeasure at being ignored when I want attention, yowling to let anyone within earshot know that once again they managed to forget to feed me, give me POUNCES, give me fresh water or clean my toilet.  I can see this week will be more of the same, mommy went out with Mike last night and did not clean my litter box.  I will be forced to have attitude, to glare at her and last but certainly not least, I will have to poop on the basement floor which means mommy's mommy will have a fit.  I love mommy's mommy, she gets so angry and screams and cusses, no one can cuss better than she can when angered.  Sometimes I enjoy joining in and stand beside her and yell as loudly as I can...which just pisses her off more and she launches into a whole new session.  What fun, think I will put planting poops land mines on the basement floor on the top of my list of things to accomplish today!<br />Mommy's mommy was sick last week and says she still doesn't feel good.  She gets really angry after going to the doctor, says it costs her $30 for someone to tell her she is sick and it will take time to get over the virus she seems to have picked up.  Mommy's mommy seems to think that for $30 they should say more than that...she also yells about her time being important too, waiting in an office when feeling bad shows no respect for the sick person....I think Mommy's mommy could perhaps use a class in anger management.   Still, that might cure her of her cussiing sessions and I certainly would hate to see that pass us by, those sessions are some of the more interesting times around the house.  Mommy's mommy also needs a goddamned blood test....not sure what that really means...but I do know it is something else that keeps her in rare form.  She was yelling that those "people" must be trying to miss, that she is not a pin cushion or a voodoo doll and she will give them one more chance to find a vein and get blood and then she quits!  Hmmm, all I know is the past two Saturdays mommy's mommy has gotten up to go somewhere, comes home with bandages on both arms and is grumbling about them sticking her and not getting a vein.  Sounds painful and makes her angry...more cussing, what fun!<br />Sounds like a party is coming to the house.  The 3rd annual Halloween party.  Mommy's mommy has been full of anger lately and the party has her complaining too.  Something about the damned OSU Buckeyes and their f    n' games, and why don't people get a f    n' life, she is not planning that party around sonofabitchin' OSU games and she doesn't give a shit if it is homecomng the party will be on the 18th and if people don't come she doesn't give a big fat hairy rat's ass, she is having the party anyway with those that do come and the rest can kiss her big fat ass.....  As you can tell, something has her going, I love it.  Those Buckeyes and their games better watch out, mommy's mommy is pissed and will probably swear anytime someone brings it up..heeheeee.  Wish I could make her understand yowling, I would bring it up all the time  :- )<br />Besides cussing something else is happening.  Cooler weather which means open windows.  Last night was particularly wonderful, cool and so many scents on the breeze, a great window sitting night.  Of course those dumbass, longhaired idiots of the dog world got to go out for a walk in the park last night.  Then they come home, dirt, gras and twigs matted in their hair, dragging that shit into my home and chewing on themselves to get it out of their fur.  Why can't they learn to avoid messes, fools, instead of walking into trouble.  Them and their noses, if not up someone's ass the nose is to the ground and they pay no attention to what they are doing.  Idiots, all three of them.<br />Trouble on the homefront.  Seems the "family" thinks one of the inferior outside cats is pretty and they wish she could get along with me so she could move in and become a "house" cat.  No way in hell is "Little Fluff" moving in with me.  This is a one cat house and that tiger striped, poofy tailed little skank can just stay outside where she was born and belongs.  Little tramp will probably get knocked up and have kittens before next spring.  Always fluffing that tail and putting her butt in someone's face, she has not shame.  I have heard rumors of taking her for a ride to the vet's and getting her spayed...not sure what that is but I hope it happens and that it is awful.  I hate her, soft, plush fur, pixie faced, big green eyed bitch!  NEVER I SAY, NEVER WILL SHE LIVE IN MY HOUSE!!!!  I am RATTY, RULER OF MY UNIVERSE.  Let that bitch try it, will kick her ass.<br />Well, time to move on.  Until later</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello loyal subjects, I have neglected you for far too long.  But last week was just fab-u-lous!!!!  Only mommy and I were home.  The butt-sniffing mutuants were boarded at the vets and mommy's mommy and daddy went away on vacation for a few days.  The house was quiet, no one chased me, mommy was scared so sit and petted me lots and had all the lights on in the house....life was perfect.  It is amazing how good "food for mature" cats tastes when not covered in dog drool.  My water bowl was clean, no slimey dog spit in my bowl.  Heaven cannot be any better than last week.<br />The people were talking, seems when they delivered the "boys" to the vet that Oscar threw a fit and thrashed in the arms of the caretaker and snapped at him.  Ha Ha.....didn't even faze the guy and he just plunked Oscar the Ogre right into a cage...a cage with a cement floor.  This was done to the crown prince of dogdom, like I said, last week was my glimpse into heaven.  I heard the other two disgusting creatures were more cooperative and just accepted their fates and were placed into cages as well.  Bet they were miserable.  I know they smelled of disinfectant and poop when they came home.  Vet offices do have a distinctive odor.  Glad I have not had to visit for quite some time.  You see, there are other cats there, inferior to me of course but one that has my coloring really things she is queen and I do not like her at all.  I also heard there are kittens there looking for a home...no way!  This is a one cat household and will remain that way, I am the ONE!<br />Mommy's mommy was sad Sunday, she said she really is looking forward to retirement and vacation just makes it so much harder to go back and face a new week.  Not sure what "work" really is but I know people seem to dread it.  Must be worse than being boarded at the vet's.<br />Glorious September has arrived and some cooler weather.  The air conditioning is turned off and the windows are open.  I love having all the windows open.  First of all, I am a full figured lady and the sills are not quite large enough for me to be totally comfortable and secondly, I can smell the outside smells and hear the sounds more clearly.  I love to dart from window to window chasing those stupid birds.  Someday I might have the opportunity to catch one.  Not sure why I want to do that, just know that it would fulfill a need.  Just like when the occassional mouse invades the house and I get to kill it.  It just makes me feel so invincible.  I am the mighty one, I AM RATTY.  Yes, open windows make me feel all powerful.  People should have that opportunity but sadly I think it is just for us cats.<br />Know this post is not all that exciting but I have just been so mellow that it is difficult for me to be my usual sarcastic, viscious self.  Never fear, the real me will return soon....BEWARE!</div><br>
