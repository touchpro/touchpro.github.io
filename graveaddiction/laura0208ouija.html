On February 28, 2008 I received an e-mail from Laura Hernandez about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have had bad and good experiences, needless to say I still use my board today and will never get rid of it.
<br><br>
First the bad:
<br><br>
Many years ago, my friends and I decided to purchase a ouija board and play with it at my home.  There were five of us playing with it; I was afraid of it so decided to just watch.  My friend's brother was among the five and he started antagonizing the spirit by calling it names, and saying ahhh your dead, blah blah.  The spirit was pissed off and started saying to him that she was going to have sex with him while he is sleeping, and he said you can't you're a spirit, and she said you will see.  So to test out the spirit, he wrote on a piece of paper a phrase that he only would know, didn't show it to any of us, and told the spirit if you have all these magical powers why don't you tell me what I wrote down on this piece of paper.  The spirit wrote out EXACTLY WHAT HE WROTE...they immediately reacted and took their hands off the board, they then started saying &quot;say goodbye, say goodbye&quot; but it wouldn't leave. I had a wall full of mirrors, right behind my kitchen table, and that's where they were all at with the board.  All of a sudden, there was a huge thump sound and the mirrors looked as if they were about to fall out on us!  We all started screaming and ran, and threw the board out...my husband picked up the board and said, no you can't do that, you can't leave that bad spirit here, and we kept on saying say good bye say goodbye until it left...whewww that was scary, and everyone ended up spending the night because I was too scared to sleep alone.
<br><br>
Good story:
<br><br>
So after that ordeal happened, I didn't touch a board for many years after that.  One day I was in Toys R Us and my husband and I just said, oh what the heck...we picked it up and purchased it.  First person to come on the board, my deceased mom.  This was back in 2000, it's now 2008.  I have the same board, and the only person I speak to is my mom and my brother that passed away in 2004.  My mom warns me about things, my brother as well.  They cannot predict the future and cannot tell me anything that pertains to God or heaven, because they say they just cannot do that...they cannot play God and tell me if something bad is going to happen, but what she does is tell me Laura, be careful today at work ok.  Or if I am going on a job interview she prays for me and somehow, someway I get what I want.  Needless to say that to me my ouija board is my connection to my mom that passed away when I was 9 years old.  I don't tell this to anyone because people may think I am crazy.  My husband and I are the only ones she speaks to and I am glad I have my ouija board.
