On April 25, 2008 I received an e-mail from Reid Erickson about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have had a lot of ouija board expirences, but this one is always a crowd pleaser, a fan favorite if you will. I'm a 22 year old gentleman, so I can tell a juicy one if I do say so myself, as opposed to the 12 year old girls who talk about how they asked the board which boy likes who, no offense of course.
<br><br>
A long time ago, I became interested in haunting and et cetera, which led me to become all too interested in the ouija board.
<br><br>
I found that my girlfriend had one, so I borrowed her's. My friend (JD) and I decided to use it.  We used it many times, but with little to no avail. We'd meet spirits every once in awhile. But they never had anything to say. We just had pointless conversation, until one spirit would come on time to time.
<br><br>
It introduced itself as &quot;q,&quot; and wouldn't ever create real words when we asked it questions except for swears and insults, just jibrish otherwise. His visits over time became more frequent until it was only him, and he wouldn't let anyone else on: sort of like Dug.
<br><br>
The difference between Q and Dug is I like Dug; I hate Q.
<br><br>
One night JD and I were using the board, and Q became something a little more than just annoying.
<br><br>
I don't have the conversation scribed, but I can remember enough to adlib. I will describe the conversation in traditional Grave Addiction fashion. The most entertaining/easy way to lay out.
<br><br>
JD and I: Is there anyone who would like to come forth?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Please tell me it's not Q<br>
Board: You wish fucker<br>
<br>
