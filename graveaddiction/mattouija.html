On December 17, 2004 I received an e-mail from Matt Roberts, who runs the EXCELLENT <a href="http://www.tmghosthunters.com" TARGET="_blank">TM Ghost Hunters</a> website.  He shared an interesting ouija story that was posted on his site, and allowed me to post it here on my site too!  Here's the story:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Hey Beth, I wanted to share with you a crazy experience I had with the Ouija. Actually, I didn't have it, but I was... well you'll see. Anyway, I got this posted on my site, so I thought you could use it too!

First let me tell you, I always liked the Ouija, but I was never a firm believer in it. When I was 15 or so a friend of mine and I would play with mine all the time and we'd talk to all kinds of people, but we never really took it seriously as we thought it was just goofy. That and I think we both kind of thought that the other was moving the pointer. But when I was in the 10th grade or so (or whatever the story says) is when I believed.  Here's the story...
<br><br> 
<b>Why I Believe In The Ouija</b>
<br><br>  
Here's a story of why I believe in the powers of the Ouija board. I am not making this up in any way, and it still freaks me out to this day.
<br><br> 
Back in the 3rd grade or so, I can't really remember when it first happened, my step sister was always using the Ouija board. I was young and too scared to mess with it, so I never got involved with it. But she always told me about her experiences which could've been why I was so scared to use it lol.
<br><br> 
But this one particular time she told me about how she was talking to this 16 year old boy, blonde hair, blue eyes, and he said his name was Keith Zeus. He told her that he was burried under my house! And he continuously asked her to be his girlfriend. She kept telling him no and I'm glad she did as it could've been trying to possess her and maybe by her saying yes she would've been allowing him to come into her body and take control of her. Who knows, that's just my opinion.
<br><br> 
But this is where it gets really freaky.
<br><br> 
When I was in the 10th grade, I was talking to a friend of mine who lived on the other side of town from where I had used to live as I didn't live in that house anymore. This girl didn't know my family at all, and I had never told anyone of that happening since it had happened so many years before and I pretty much forgot about it.
<br><br> 
She tells me that she was messing with the Ouija board one night and she started talking to this 16 year old boy... you know where I'm going with this. Blonde hair, blue eyes...
<br><br> 
I asked her if his name was Keith Zeus and she turned pale. I asked her if he kept trying to get her to be his girlfriend and she seriously looked like she had seen a ghost. She then asked me how I knew that and I told her about my step sisters experience so many years before.
<br><br> 
I was freaked out as well, being that two people had talked to the same spirit and basically had the same conversation so many years apart, and in two different locations, though it was the same city. But here's what got me. I asked her if he told her where he was burried, and she said that he told her "Somewhere in NCH". That's where we were... where my old house was... too freaky. Maybe he really is burried under the house. It didn't have a basement, just a crawl space under the house.
<br><br> 
This is also the same house where I had 6 spirits and lived there for 6 years... yeah, he could have been one of the spirits in the house. By the way, that's how we found out about how many spirits were in that house. Keith Zeus had told my step sister that while they were talking. At first and for many years I was skeptical about the whole thing if I actually remembered it. But after talking to the girl in my class, it all came back to me and then I thought that maybe it was all true.
<br><br>
Very strange stuff. I'm going to go to the city hall there and see if I can find anything out about a Keith Zeus in years past and see if I can find out what happened to him. If he was missing and never found, then maybe I can find out if he really is under the house, and maybe... just maybe, he can have a proper burial. Who knows.&quot;
