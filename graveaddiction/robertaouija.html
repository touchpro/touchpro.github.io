On June 29, 2005 I received an e-mail from Roberta about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have used ouija boards many times, and had a lot of the same effects as you and your friends (I got the cold hands and tingling, it also went to goodbye many times one day).  But I have a question. The first time you talked on the 1920's board, and Amanda asked, &quot;How can he follow us?&quot;, and the board said &quot;rotate&quot;, the next question's answer gave me a memory. When the answer was &quot;MIW&quot;, did you ever figure out what that meant?
<br><br>
My reason for wondering is because of something that happened to me and a friend (Serina). We were talking to her spirit guide, Deena. Serina told me to close my eyes so I wouldn't know what Deena was spelling while Serina asked a question in her head. But when Serina waved her hand down my face (without touching it) a picture of a lady appeared and it freaked me out. I opened my eyes immediately and told Serina what happened.  Serina asked ,&quot;Was that you&quot;, and Deena said yes. Then Deena moved to the sun drawn on the board. Well, later we found out she was some sort of sun goddess. She said she had something to tell us. She went to the numbers 6, 7, 8. We asked many questions and the only clue to help us was MIW.  We got frustrated and said we would figure it out some other day. Is this just some weird similarity? What do you think MIW means?
<br><br>   
Jim Copen, a website visitor, had some input on the meaning of MIW:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I can't say for certain, but I think MIW means mother in waiting. The reason I think so is because when my ex was pregnant I used the board I had.  After questions like &quot;where are you&quot;  and &quot;where do I belong&quot; I got the MIW response...If I remember right it was 2 days later my ex told me she was pregnant.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In October 2005 I received an e-mail from Jennifer Feuerstein with her input on the meaning of MIW:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>MIW seemed vaguely familiar, and I suppose it could probably be used for a lot of different things. I've seen old almanacs marked with MIW to mean Moon In Waning... so it could refer to a lunar cycle. But then you could link the lunar cycle to things growing or shrinking just as the moon shrinks and grows (or appears too). It can also be related to motherhood with the sun goddess story because one of the phases of the moon goddess is the Mother and in some stories they're sisters. The numbers 6,7,8 could refer to dates, times, or months. Interesting how they correlate to: summer-june, july, august- morning hours where the sun starts and finally blocks out the moon- or a cycle of days during a waning cycle.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In February 2006 I received an e-mail from Vschwintosky about a possible meaning of MIW: &quot;Maybe I Won't.&quot;  What a great suggestion!
<br><br>
I received another possible meaning from Lesley B. in June 2007:  &quot;MIW--could mean movement in worship?&quot;
<br><br>
Do you have any ideas what MIW might mean?  If so, please send me an e-mail: <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">graveaddiction@gmail.com</a>.
