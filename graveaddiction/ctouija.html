On June 26, 2006 I received an e-mail from Claudia Trevino about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It was my senior year in high school - between January and April 1998. I was with my friends: Vicki, Jessica, Valerie, Angie, and Cindy.  We were having a little get together at Cindy's house. Vicki brought the Ouija Board with her. I decided to give it a try, and Jessica and Valerie tried it with me. There were three different experiences, but I can't remember if it was at the same time.
<br><br>
The first experience was with a spirit named &quot;Jerry.&quot; We asked him if he was with us and he said yes, then we asked him if he was sitting next to one of us and he said yes. I gave him my friend's name, and when I said Angie he said yes and she screamed. That scared her.
<br><br>
The second experience, we were listening to the song &quot;2 Become 1&quot; by the Spice Girls.  We stopped because we didn't know what to ask, but we kept our hands on the board. Then the arrow started moving by itself and neither one of us were moving it. Valerie said the letters outloud that were being picked and it said 'rewind the tape'. We asked rewind what? Then it said '2 B-E-C-O' and before it finished Valerie finished it: &quot;2 Become 1.&quot; I asked it 'You want us to rewind &quot;2 Become 1&quot; and it said 'Yes'. Apparently the spirit liked that song and to this day I don't like to hear that song as a result.
<br><br>
The third experience, I decided to take it home because no one wanted to take it home.  Later that night I heard the little trash can in the restroom fall down. I got a little scared. The next morning when I asked my parents if they heard the trash can fall, they said no. That just freaked me out.
<br><br>
These are my experiences with the Ouija Board. Whether the Ouija Board is real or not, I don't know. Maybe for some people it is and for others it may not...but all I do know is even with these experiences and hearing other people's experiences I still want to play it.
