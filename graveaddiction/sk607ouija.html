On June 4, 2007 I received an e-mail from Sierra and Karrie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

The other day we bought an ouija board and we decided to see if it really worked.  This is basically how it went:
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Who are we talking to?<br>
Board: Fred<br>
<br>
Us: How old are you, Fred?<br>
Board: 46<br>
<br>
Us: Did you live in this house?<br>
Fred: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Did you die in this house?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die?<br>
Fred: h s<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you evil?<br>
Fred: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you going to hurt us?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you playing with us?<br>
Fred: James<br>
<br>
Us: Who is James?<br>
Fred: Dad<br>
<br>
Sierra: Is he my dad?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Karrie: Is he my dad?<br>
Fred: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is he with you?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
(My friend called and we put her on speaker to hear us a few minutes. Later my phone hung up by itself.)
<br><br>
Us:  Fred, is it OK if my friend listens to us?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Us: Did you hang up on my friend?<br>
Fred: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you sorry for hanging up on my friend?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Us: Do you know my friend?<br>
Fred: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Do you know her name?<br>
Fred: No<br>
<br>
Us:  Do you like my friend?<br>
Board: Fuck<br>
<br>
Us:  Is this still Fred?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us:  Who are we talking to?<br>
Board: Kyle<br>
<br>
Us:  How old are you, Kyle?<br>
Kyle: 10<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die?<br>
Kyle: Gun<br>
<br>
Us:  Did someone hurt you with a gun?<br>
Kyle: No<br>
<br>
Us: Was it an accident?<br>
Kyle: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Did someone shoot you on accident?<br>
Kyle: No<br>
<br>
Us:  Did you shoot yourself on accident?<br>
Board:  (no movement)<br>
<br>
Us:  Kyle, did you hurt yourself with a gun on accident?<br>
Kyle: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Kyle, what year did you die?<br>
Kyle: 1984<br>
<br>
Us:  You died in 1984?<br>
Kyle: No<br>
<br>
Us:  What year did you die?<br>
Kyle: 1974<br>
<br>
Us:  You died in 1974?<br>
Kyle: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Was your mom there?<br>
Kyle: No<br>
<br>
Us: Are you OK where you're at?<br>
Kyle: Yes<br>
<br>
(We decided that now was a good time to leave the Ouija board alone because we became very upset with what we were told...but it only lasted a few minutes)<br>
<br>
Us: Can we talk to Phillipe Jesus Vijen?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Popo, are you OK?<br>

Us: Popo, we are with Athena.  Do you remember her nickname?<br>
Popo: Jue<br>
<br>
Us: Popo, what was your last answer?  We didn't get it.<br>
Popo: y s<br>
<br>
(Athena told us her nickname was Jewels)<br>
<br>
Us: Popo, do you want to tell Athena anything?<br>
Popo: Love u Jr<br>
<br>
(We asked Athena if she knew anybody named Jr and she said it was her cousin.)<br>
<br>
Us: Did you want us to tell Jr anything?<br>
Popo: Baby<br>
<br>
Us:  Is the baby OK?<br>
Popo: No<br>
<br>
Us: Popo, do you remember Vassy's nickname?<br>

<br>
(Popo called her Ug, short for Ugly)<br>
<br>

<br>
Us: Who are we talking to?<br>

<br>
Us: Who do we ask for?<br>
Board: BJ<br>
<br>
Us: Do you want us to call that number?<br>
Board: Yes b w<br>

<br>
Us: Is he going to be OK?<br>
Board: D i (it then started to move towards the e and I threw the board)<br>
<br>

<br>
Us: Where is Jarred?<br>
Board: Rape<br>
<br>

<br>
Us:  Are all the spirits here okay if we smoke?<br>
Board: Weed<br>
<br>
(We then got up and went to smoke a cigarette)<br>
<br>
Us: Are there any spirits that want to talk to us?<br>
Board: (very slowly) Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you sure, because your last answer was questionable?<br>
Board: Just James<br>
<br>
Us:  Are we talking to just James?<br>
James: Yes<br>
