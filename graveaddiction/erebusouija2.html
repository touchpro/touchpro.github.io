On April 17, 2007 I received an e-mail from Erebus about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Last night, after midnight on Friday the 13th (technically as it was past midnight), I held an ouija seance with 3 friends. Here's how the story goes.
<br><br>
Us: Is anyone wishing to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes and more<br>
<br>
Us: What do you mean by more?<br>
Board: U will C<br>
<br>
Us: What will we see?<br>
Board: Its a surprise<br>
<br>
Us: Ok what is your name?<br>
Board: Surprise to<br>
<br>
Us: When will we see more, is more your name or your friends?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Are you male or female?<br>
Board: Male<br>
<br>
Us: Are you good or evil?<br>
Board: Bit of both not that evil<br>
<br>
Us: So you do evil things then?<br>
Board: Not evil more naughty ha ha<br>
<br>
Us: So you mean your a bit naughty now and then?<br>
Board: U got it<br>
<br>
Us: How are you naughty?<br>
Board: U will C<br>
<br>
Us: We will see you being naughty?<br>
Board: Surprise is naughty<br>
<br>
Us: Ok, so our surprise will show us how naughty you are?<br>
Board: U got it<br>
<br>
Us: I can't wait for my surprise...I love surprises, I hope it's a good one.<br>
Board: It good<br>
<br>
Us: Can you get on with it please?<br>
Board: The draw under the bed open it<br>
<br>
We open up the drawer, and we hear a crackling sound.  It was my radio. My radio has no batteries in it yet, and it was making a noise. I placed the radio on the board. Then we mananged to hear a faint voice through the crackling sound from the radio. &quot;You dare make fun me of? Ha! You will feel what I feeled,&quot; came from the radio. Then the crackling and voice stopped. I then picked up the radio and got an electric shock from it. It wasn't that strong, but it made the hairs on my head stand up. It sure woke me up, I was charged. I had dropped the radio during the shock. So I picked it up and placed it on the table. We then went back to the board.
<br><br>
Us: Is anyone still with us?<br>
Board: Yes Damien<br>
<br>
Us: So it was you who gave me the shock?<br>
Board: U got it<br>
<br>
Us: So Damien was this your revenge on me? I'm sorry I just say what comes in my mind.<br>
Board: A good quality I like that<br>
<br>
Us: Your surprise was good?<br>
Board: Glad u enjoyed<br>
<br>
Us: So you like playing tricks on people.  Is this what makes you naughty?<br>
Board: Yes I like playing tricks<br>
<br>
Us: What do you like about playing tricks?<br>
Baord. Peoples reactions make me laugh<br>
<br>
Us: So were our reactions funny?<br>
Board: Yes your face was so funny and your hair I wish I had a photo<br>
<br>
Us: Yeah he looked like sonic.<br>
Board: Whos sonic<br>
<br>
Us: A character in a computer game - he's a blue super speedy hedgehog named sonic with spikey hair.<br>
Board: Ok i c<br>
<br>
Us: Nice to speak to you Damien.  Can we speak with you soon?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anyone else present?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Can we speak to them?<br>
Board: Yes Goodbye<br>
<br>
Us: Goodbye.  Is anyone else willing to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Hi, what's your name?<br>
Board: Hi my name is Joanne<br>
<br>
Us: What did you do in life?<br>
Board: Was a witch<br>
<br>
Us: What did you do as a witch?<br>
Board: Practising my witch craft castng spells and ouija boards<br>
<br>
Us: So you were like my friend Ann? ( Ann is a witch, a friend who's present at the seance...her real name isn't Ann)<br>
Board: Yes but not as fascinated on men as she is<br>
<br>
Ann. Hey, I'm not fascinated by men! I just appreciate a fine man.<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Us: So, you did ouija boards like us?  Did you like doing them?<br>
Board: Yeah they are fun but i did not think i would be on the other side of one<br>
<br>
Us: Yeah, I hadn't thought that.  Maybe one day I could be on the other side of one, one day.<br>
Board: I will get in touch soon busy tonite Goodbye<br>
<br>
Us: Yes we'll stay in touch. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Us: Is anyone else there?<br>
Board: I'm freddy I'm going to get you<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Do U know what day it is<br>
<br>
Us: Yeah Friday the 13th.<br>
Board: Have U seen the films<br>
<br>
Us: Yeah, but that was Jason.  You got the wrong film! Ha ha ha, yeah freddy's from Elm Street!<br>
Board: Shit I &amp;$%@ed that 1 up<br>
<br>
Board: Ok Goodbye<br>
Us: Goodbye ha ha ha<br>
<br>
We tried to get on the board but had no answers, so we decided to give up.
