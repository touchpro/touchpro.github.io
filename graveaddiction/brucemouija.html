On January 10, 2007 I received an e-mail from Bruce M. about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I was probably about 8 years old, and I was at a friend's house for a sleepover. We were just a few young boys consumed with video games, comics, and cartoons. We ended up using his ouija board and ultimately we ended speaking to A-l-v-i-n. We asked him for a last name, and we ended up spelling out A-i-l-e-y. At the time I had no clue who Alvin Ailey was. I kept wondering if my friend was messing with me, but he seemed just as spooked as I was. We asked who he was, and the board spelled out D-a-n-c-e-r. That's as far as the ouija that night went. It wasn't until about 2 years later, while being driven around in Brooklyn, NY, that I learned that the person we spoke to in the Ouija session was a real person. I learned this as I drove by the &quot;Alvin Ailey School of Dance.&quot; I had never heard or been taught anything about Alvin Ailey at that point in my life, and since my friend was in the same classes as me, it was unlikely that he had either. Now unless my friend was truly messing with me that night (which he swore up and down that night he wasn't), I definitely believe in the power of the ouija board. But why would Alvin Ailey of all people want to talk to some young kids messing with a Ouija for the first time?
