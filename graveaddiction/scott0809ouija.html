On August 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Scott about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So I live in the Presbyterian Home for Children, and I had really wanted to play with a ouija board for a long time. Well, me and a few friends went to the mall and bought one from Spencers. I really wasn't suppose to have this board, but really had to have it.  So a few kids from a group home started playing with a ouija board.
<br><br>
Our first session was at a picnic pavilion that is recently new on campus. Three of us, me (Scott), Andy, and Chris. We put it in the middle of us, and made our knees touch. We asked the board &quot;Are there any spirits present,&quot; and in a while it went to YES.
<br><br>
Us: Are you a good spirit or a bad spirit?<br>
Board:  Bad<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Jim<br>
<br>
Us: All right. How did you die?<br>
Board: Skotty shot me<br>
<br>
Us: Do you seek any revenge?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: OK, could you give us a sign that you're here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Okay, there are nine fan blades hanging over this gigantic pavilion, and the three in the back started moving. Holy crap. No wind or anything, I swear. They started moving as soon as it hit yes.
<br><br>
Andy then asked, &quot;Okay, give us one more sign if you're here.  Can you make the wind blow?&quot;  The board went to GO, and we thought he was spelling GO to make the wind go, but he kept going GOD IS HERE. And the planchette went to goodbye.
<br><br>
HOLY CRAP!!!! God totally just scared this spirit off. We've had two more converstaions with him down there, and he told us once after we had asked him how he planned to act his revenge.  He wrote:
<br><br>
RUREADY
<br><br>
We then realized it spelled R U READY.
<br><br>
Ready for what, are you mad at us?
<br><br>
HELL IS COMEING
<br><br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>
The next day we asked him if he was mad at us. He said NO. We asked what are you going to do to get revenge. He said KILL.  We asked do we know the person.  He said no. We asked if we could help him pass on, like relive his soul. He said YES. We have to wait until tomorrow to talk to him again.
<br><br>
And that is the story of the orphans and their ouija board.
