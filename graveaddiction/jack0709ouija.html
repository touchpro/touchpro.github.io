On July 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jack about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Jack, from MS.<br>
<br>


My one and only experience was when I was a teenager a long time ago - back in the 1960's.  I was on an overnight church youth trip, of all places, and one of the kids in the group brought an ouija board.  I think most of the other kids were like me, and that was the first ouija board they had ever seen.  We probably had about a dozen boys and girls in our youth group, and we were all out by the pool.  Two of the kids were sitting in chairs using the board, and the rest of us were standing and completely surrounding the two with the board.  Everone was taking turns asking questions, most of which involved, which boy liked which girl, and things like that.  We all had a good time laughing at the answers and the embarassed kids that the board was naming.  I'm sure most of the kids standing and watching the board assumed the two at the board were actually answering the questions, and the board had nothing really to do with it.
<br><br>
Well, when it was my turn again to ask a question, I was drawing a blank.  We had already discovered which boys and girls liked each other, and I couldn't think of a single question.  In the location where I was standing, I was facing the two-lane highway, and remember, the two kids at the board were sitting and they were completely surrounded by the others in the group.  I happened to look toward the highway as a blue, Global Van Lines, 18-wheeler quickly past by.  I thought I would be smart and ask a question there was no way the kids at the board could know.  There was absoultely no way they could have seen that truck speed by, out there on the highway.  I smiled as I asked my question, &quot;What was the name on the truck that just went by?&quot;  I still get chill-bumps some forty years later, as I remember the sight of that board slowly spelling G L O B A L !!!!!
<br><br>
This is a true experience - not necessarily scary - but 100% true.
