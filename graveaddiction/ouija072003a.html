On July 31, 2003 Amanda came over to my place for a &quot;contacting the dead&quot; session.  We ended up using two boards this night.  The strangest thing that happened had to be Amanda's hand...when we decided to switch boards Amanda said her hand was tingling.  Then she asked me if my hands felt cold.  I said no, and then she told me to touch her hand....it was FREEZING!  The hand she used to touch the planchette was the ice cold one, but her other hand felt normal.  Too strange!!
<br><br>
We used the antique board from the 1920's first, this session lasted almost 37 minutes.
