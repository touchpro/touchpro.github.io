On August 12, 2005 I met up with Donna and T.C. at <a href="malabar.html">Malabar Farm State Park</a>.  Later that evening at their campsite, we decided to try and contact some spirits using the 1940's Hasko ouija board.  This was the second of three ouija sessions that took place that night.  It was the second longest at 54 minutes, 35 seconds.  We had a few creepy things happen during this session...
