On February 19, 2005 I received an e-mail from Cristi Smith about a great ouija session she and her friend Whitney had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Cristi and Whitney played on February 18-19 2005 between 11pm-3am.  This was the first time for either of us to play.  We're both sixteen years old.
<br><br> 
I went to a website and copied the format of the Ouija on to a piece of cardboard, and found a circular object with a hole in the middle to use as our planchette.
<br><br> 
We lit a candle, turned off the lights, and recited our opening prayer. We sat for about 5 minutes, discouraged with nothing happening. Until I simply said, &quot;for this to work, the both of us have to really believe it will.&quot; And it hadn't been more than 2 seconds, that the planchette started to move.
<br><br> 
Slowly. Very slowly. Whitney and I kept asking each other if we swore we weren't moving it. And of course, neither of us did.
<br><br> 
The first spirit that we contacted was a twelve year old boy that died in my house, or around it, in 1987. He kept going to &quot;OD&quot; so we assumed he meant from an overdose. When asked if it was accidental, he moved to &quot;yes&quot;. He liked watching TV and playing games. We probably talked to him for 10-15 minutes before he said &quot;I have a message for Whitney.&quot; When we asked him to spell it out, he went to &quot;CFD loves you.&quot;
<br><br> 
Those three initials are those of Whitney's grandpa. (I didn't know that). We asked if he was in the room, and it said &quot;yes, on the bed.&quot; Whitney started crying, and the planchette moved to &quot;Sh&quot; over and over again. We asked some fun questions like &quot;Is Whitney going to be famous&quot; and if he enjoyed listening to her sing. Of course, the planchette went to &quot;yes.&quot; I said, &quot;Well only if she stops being so shy&quot; and the planchette lingered, and then abruptly moved to yes. Then, being dumb, I asked who her best friend was. He spelled out &quot;C-R-I-S-T-I D-A-N-I-E-L-E S-M-I-T&quot; We both laughed that he spelled almost the whole thing. We asked the age in which she'd marry, and he said &quot;23&quot;. We asked if it would be Cody, and he said &quot;No but gl&quot; (goodluck). He kept wanting to go letter by letter in the alphabet trying to be funny to make us laugh. (She was crying, and I was worried about her).  Then we heard a cup fall from the counter to the sink. We asked if he was in the bathroom, and he said &quot;yes.&quot; We asked if he was being mischievious and he said &quot;maybe&quot;. We asked if that drink worked out well, and he went to no. It was pretty funny.
<br><br> 
We asked if this board was safe to play on and he said &quot;maybe.&quot; We asked if that meant sometimes, and he said &quot;yes.&quot; Then we asked how many spirits are with us, and he said 34. It was a crowded Cristi-room last night. We asked if they were all good, and he said &quot;no.&quot; That kind of creeped us out, but we got over it.
<br><br> 
We said goodbye to him, and tried to contact my grandma. Sure enough, I did. I asked her some questions to see if it was really her, and it was. I asked her what she made for me when I was a baby, and it spelled out &quot;B-L-A-N-K-E-T&quot; I asked her what was on it, and she said &quot;B-E-A-R-S&quot;. Absolutely correct. I asked her if I still had it, and she said yes. I asked her if mom made the right decision to take her out of the nursing home and to Alaska. The planchette moved to &quot;yes&quot;. We asked her if she had a message, and she said &quot;yes&quot;. We asked her to spell it out. We realized it was long so we asked her to spell it out again so we could watch more carefully. She wrote, &quot;I never got to say goodbye.&quot; Which is correct. I started crying hard. I asked if she was mad that I didn't go to her funeral, and she said no. Then she said &quot;love you&quot; and went to &quot;goodbye&quot;. I finally feel like I have closure with my grandma.
<br><br> 
We contacted another spirit named Ed, but he was very random throughout the night, and would just spell out random gibberish, and then go to goodbye.
<br><br> 
We seemed to have contacted Jon Benet Ramsey (yes, the little girl from the murder case), but we were kind of skeptical. She wasn't really answering questions correctly. We asked the year she was born, and she said 1991, and she died in 1996. And that she'd be 13 right now, but that's not true. She said her dad murdered her, and that it was on purpose, not accidental. And her mom did write the letter. Then she went to &quot;Qus&quot; (for question). We asked her to spell out her question, and she repeatedly spelled out, &quot;Are you p-o&quot;. We still can't figure that out. We asked her if she could rest, and she said &quot;N-o&quot; over and over. We told her we had no further questions, and she went to &quot;goodbye&quot;.
<br><br> 
That's the end of my story. The Ouija works... atleast by my best knowlege. Can't say it will with you. You have to have an open mind, and an open heart. But if you use one, please be careful. You never know who you're really talking to. We blessed the room/board/ourselves by prayer both before and after using the board. 
<br><br> 
But as you can see, it can be a worth while experience.&quot;
