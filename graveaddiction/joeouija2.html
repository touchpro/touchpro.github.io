On December 18, 2005 I received an e-mail from Joe Bucci about another interesting ouija board experience he had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I was at my friend's house playing ouija with him (Spenser) and another friend (Britney), when we contacted a spirit (we tape recorded the session for fun) and some kinda scary stuff happened:
<br><br>
Spenser:  Is there anyone there who would like to communicate with us?<br>
Board:  <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
Britney:  If there is anyone there, could you please move to the first letter of your first name? <i>(this is what usually gets a response whenever I have played... with my board, at least.)</i><br>
Board:  SPEG<br>
<br>
Me:  Do you want to tell us your name?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Britney:  Are you male or female? Yes for male, No for female.v
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Spenser:  How old are you?<br>
Board:  6<br>
<br>
Spenser:  You're six?<br>
Board:  yes<br>
<br>
Britney:  Is there anything you would like to tell us?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Me:  What is it?<br>
Board:  LW<br>
<br>
<i>At this point, there is a short pause, and then we hear a loud crash coming from the kitchen.  Spenser and Britney nearly fell out of their chairs and I... don't really know what I did... I just froze, I guess.
<br><br>
After freaking out for a minute, we finally went to the kitchen.  When we get there, we see the box that our pizza was in lying on the floor and one of Spenser's cats eating the crumbs.  We were a little relieved and assumed the cat had knocked it off of the island.  (One thing - his island is higher than the average countertop... it's more like a bar, so I didn't really know if the cat could get up there easily or not... but I just assumed it was the cat)
<br><br>
We go back to the board:</i>
<br><br>
Britney:  Sorry!  We just got really freaked out.<br>
Board:  U JUST HEARD ME<br>
<br><br>
<i>At that, we stopped playing.  I was pretty shaken up after it said that... and both of my friends swear they weren't making it say that... and I definitely was not!&quot;</i>
