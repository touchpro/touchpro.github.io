On December 28, 2006 I received an e-mail from Stephani S. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ok, well last night my friend and I were using the Ouija board that my brother gave me. I'm 15 and my friend is 17. We've used it a couple times before, but we weren't sure if we should expect something or not. Well, my friend asked how many people were in the room, and the planchette went to 4. My friend and I were the only ones in the room. We asked if the other two people were good or bad spirits, and it said good. Their names were Sam and David, and they said they knew us in our past lives. They said they are 16 and 17 years old, and they were murdered by someone named Jeff. They said he is reincarnated and my friend knows him. They said they wanted to talk to us through the board and they came for our help. We asked what kind of help they needed, and all they said was &quot;Jeff.&quot; When we asked what Jeff's name is now, they said Dale, and that's my friend's boyfriend's name. Well, then Sam and David said that my friend and I are reincarnated now because we were hung for being witches in our past lives. They also said that my friend and I have some sort of Wiccan &quot;powers&quot; now, but we don't know it yet. They said that Jeff murdered them over jealousy for something and we were part of it. They told us they were murdered on September 26, 1823, and my friend and I were hung on September 27, 1823. September 27 is my friend's birthday. Also, they said my friend and I were sisters in our past lives. We went to search them online, and when we got back we put our fingers on the planchette and it started moving, and it asked &quot;What was that box you were on?&quot; We figured they were talking about the computer. They said they didn't give us their real names because of Jeff. So I'm not sure what to think. They also said in our past lives, my friend's name was Nicole and mine was Claire, and in my friend's language class at school, her name is Nicole Clair.
<br><br>
This morning we used it again and it said that Sam and David were there again. When my friend and I had to leave, we told the spirits, and the planchette moved to &quot;goodbye.&quot; When my friend and I asked if anyone was there, the planchette didn't move.
<br><br>
Throughout the whole thing the spirits had trouble spelling things. They spelt &quot;the&quot; as &quot;tha&quot;, and things like that. We plan on using the board again to see if we can contact the two spirits again, but we don't plan on asking for proof because of stories we've heard about how the spirit can come into our plane if we ask for proof.
<br><br>
I'm also not sure whether or not to believe all of the things the spirits said. I'm not even sure if I believe in past lives or reincarnation, but it's hard not to believe with these kinds of experiences.
