On November 9, 2005 I received an e-mail from Jen W. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My first experience with an ouija board was the only one that ever worked for me.  I was at my friend Amber's birthday party when we were in grade seven.  There was a group of us playing ouija, which I had never done before.  They claimed it worked; I was skeptical.  We began to play, first joking around and moving it on our own, answering our own silly questions and that sort of thing.  All of a sudden the planchette began to move smoothly on it's own.  There were quite a few of us with fingers on the planchette so the others would have noticed if one person was pulling it.
<br><br>
The spirit that we contacted was nice at first, then he started to get mean.  I don't remember his name, I think it was Norman.  He started call us names and swearing at us.  He called us bitches and called one of the girls dog-faced and spelled out &quot;woof.&quot;  I was getting really freaked out by this point, as were the rest of the girls.  The spirit was becomming mean and began to threaten us.  We asked if we could leave and he refused to let us go and threatened us saying that we would pay if we did.  I was so terrified at this point I began to cry hysterically.  He spelled out &quot;don't cry&quot; on the board, then said good-bye and he left us.
