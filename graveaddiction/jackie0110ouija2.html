On January 13, 2010 I received an e-mail from Jackie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friends Jordan (Female), Chris (Male), and I (Jackie) all decided to use a homemade ouija board one night.  The next day we bought a real one because we loved it so much.
<br><br>
My friend Sara P. had passed away January of 2009, and we used the board around May 2009.
<br><br>
Here we go...<br>
<br>
Me: Is anybody here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can I request somebody specifically to speak to?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(These are not word for word, some bits are cut out to get to the more interesting parts.)<br>
<br>
Jordan: Can we speak to Sara P.?<br>
Board: Yes. Goodbye<br>
<br>
(About 5 minutes later)<br>
<br>
Me: Hello?<br>
Board: Hi<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Sara P.?<br>
Sara: Yes.<br>
<br>
(All three of us uncontrollably, instantly burst into heavy, heavy tears, and that's how we knew she was in our presence.)
<br><br>
All: Sara, we miss you.<br>
Board: I miss you too<br>
<br>
(In between, we asked many questions about why she had ended her own life, what were her last thoughts, and questions to prove it was Sara.  Then we decided to make sure we weren't just playing tricks on ourselves, so we lit a candle and put it on the center of the table.
<br><br>
Me: Prove you are here.<br>
Sara: No reply<br>
<br>
All: Extreme Tears<br>
<br>
Me: Did you make us cry?<br>
Sara: Yes<br>
<br>
Jordan: OH MY GOD, LOOK.<br>
<br>
(Jordan picked up three long, fine blonde hairs from the center of the board. Sara was blonde; me, Jordan, and Chris all had very dark brown hair.)
<br><br>
Me: Sara, we need you to do one more thing for us.<br>
Sara: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you blow out this candle for us?<br>
Sara: Yes<br>
<br>
It took about 5 minutes of flickering of the candle, so me, Jordan, and Chris all joined hands and squeezed and focused so hard on that candle.  It went out, and an extremely cold sensation went through the whole room. We continued to speak to Sara for a few hours after that, it was the best way for me to say goodbye.
