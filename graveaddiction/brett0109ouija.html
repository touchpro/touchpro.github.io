On January 29, 2009 I received an e-mail from Brett B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My mum purchased a Psychic Circle about 10 years ago, and we have used it sporadically over the years; maybe only once or twice a year. We always protect ourselves and say prayers and imagine a white light around us before using it. It doesn't move for me, but it moves for my mum, even if I am not on it. Over the years we have communicated  with various family members, the odd random spirit, and interestingly what appears to be my very wise and advanced spirit guide. When we start, my mum's mother always comes through first, as a kind of guardian.  She seems to move it faster than any other family member. All communication with family members like aunts, uncles, and grandparents has always been positive and loving. If we ask too many questions about what to do in the future, we are commonly advised to listen to our heart (I guess they are not there to make decisions for us). Once we spoke to the recently departed boyfriend of my neighbour. He came through quite weak, and we could literally feel the sadness in the room.
<br><br>
But most amazing of all is my Native American spirit guide.  I don't want to give his name here. He moves the glass super fast, much stronger than anyone else...so fast the glass nearly comes out of our hands.  He only allows short sessions, telling us to stop after a certain amount of time. On rare occasions, I have bugged my mum to do it when tired, and he sometimes will not allow the session to go for more than a couple of minutes. His messages are always clear and concise, unlike the confused mumbo jumbo that comes through on the rare occasions that a rogue spirit comes through. I am Australian, and he told me about meeting my current wife before I went on holiday to the USA. He spelled, &quot;Go to my country,&quot; &quot;m eager gemini,&quot; &quot;gift for north,&quot; and &quot;new lady.&quot; Well, I did end up meeting my wife there, who is a gemini and whose name starts with m.
<br><br>
I am about to go back to the USA to visit her (we've had to be apart for a bit due to commitments in our countries), and my guide issued me with a stern warning. She lives in the Bronx, New York, and while I have been there a couple of times she now stays with her sister in a more dangerous part. I had misgivings about returning there, but never told anyone. He warned me, &quot;beware bronx,&quot; &quot;don't go,&quot; &quot;harm will come to you,&quot; and &quot;wont come back.&quot; He also told me to instead go to Massachussetts to stay with her brother (he even correctly stated his star sign, which my mum did not know). He said I will be stabbed by a drug addict. The strange thing is, the two previous times that I have been in the Bronx, I have had to go to the emergency room of a hospital there for two very different reasons.  Something inside me was telling me that if I return to the Bronx, I could be in for a third visit. I am heeding this warning.
