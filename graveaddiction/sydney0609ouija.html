On June 9, 2009 I received an e-mail from Sydney about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Sydney, and I was playing on the Ouija board at 3 A.M. one morning with my friend and my sister. We contacted a spirit named Sophie who lived during the 1850s. She seemed pretty nice, although she told us that she was bad because she had killed her husband for cheating on her. Anyway, our conversation started to get really strange after awhile...
<br><br>
Me: I don't think you're an evil spirit, Sophie. I just think you were angered at your husband for cheating.<br>
Sophie: Maybe<br>
Sophie: I'm afraid of you though<br>
<br>
Me: Who me? Why?<br>
Sophie: Because you're evil<br>
<br>
Me: Are Makensie and Lindsey evil too? (my friend and my sister)<br>
Sophie: No<br>
<br>
Me: Just me then?<br>
Sophie: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you say that I'm evil?<br>
Sophie: demon<br>
<br>
Me: You're saying that I'm a demon?<br>
Sophie: Yes<br>
<br>
(the spirit on the ouija board was calling ME an evil demon)<br>
<br>
Me: What makes you say that I'm a demon?<br>
Sophie: Zodiac<br>
<br>
This confused me for awhile. My zodiac sign is Cancer the Crab. After doing a little research, I discovered that Cancerians are ruled by the Moon, which is said to be bad. Sun=good spirits; Moon=bad spirits  This did freak me out a little, but I just thought that I'm not the only person in the world who is a Cancer so that can't make me evil.<br>
<br>
Me: What other thing besides my zodiac sign would make me evil?<br>
Sophie: I D<br>
<br>
Me: I don't understand what you're saying by that? Are those initials for something?<br>
Sophie: No<br>
<br>
Me: Then what does I D mean?<br>
Sophie: Number<br>
<br>
Me: ID number?<br>
Sophie: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: ID number to what?<br>
Sophie: School<br>
<br>
This really freaked me out. I'm a college student right now and my student I.D. number which I'd put out of my mind for awhile suddenly reminded me of why Sophie would think this meant that I was an evil demon. The last three numbers of my student I.D. number are ironically &quot;666,&quot; the devil's numbers. The coincidence of those numbers along with my zodiac sign has got me wondering if maybe this spirit is right about my true nature. I don't believe that I am anything evil, but the thought that a supposedly bad spirit is telling me that she fears me because I'm evil kinda disturbs me.<br>
<br>
Me: Is there any way I can change myself to not be evil like you said?<br>
Sophie: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why not?<br>
Sophie: In blood<br>
<br>
Me: Are you saying it's in my blood to be like this?<br>
Sophie: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: There's nothing I can do?<br>
Sophie: No<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you for talking with us, Sophie.<br>
Sophie: You're welcome<br>
<br>
Me, friend and sister: Goodbye
Sophie: Goodbye
