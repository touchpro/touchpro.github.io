On December 23, 2009 I received an e-mail from Patricia M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My three college friends (C, G, and S) and I in my 8-11 PM class started talking about Ouija boards, etc. Come to find out our one friend &quot;C&quot; knew a lot about this subject, so &quot;G&quot; bought one for him because she didn't want to keep the thing. So the 1st and 2nd tries we got nothing, but it was during the new moon and &quot;C&quot; was strongly doubted that it would work with out the moon. Needless to say, we're doing this in an empty study lobby at our Community College. So our 3rd try was on a full moon, and a spirit picked up right away. So we were all like we have to do this again!  So we did that Thursday after class. We spoke to a young spirit (8 years old) who was a spirit for over 10 years.
<br><br>
C: Are there any cool cats here who want to speak to us? We only want to talk to cool cats, no baddies.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
C: What do you want us to call you?<br>
Board: J.C.<br>
<br>
S: Can you give us the lotto numbers?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: 01010102<br>
<br>
S: Are you sure?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: XIX<br>
<br>
C: What?<br>
Board: Y<br>
<br>
At this moment we were like WTF.<br>
<br>
C: Is XIX the number 19?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
C: Is Y the tree split?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this a good thing?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
The planchette started answering slower.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you getting tired J.C.?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you for speaking with us tonight. Please don't follow us home, and have a nice day.<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
We rested for a few minutes, and talked about the numbers he gave us and what they meant.<br>
<br>
C: Are there any cool cats here who want to speak to us? We only want to talk to cool cats, no baddies. We only want to speak to good spirits.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
C: What do you want us to call you?<br>
Board: G.R.<br>
<br>
Before we were able to get to know the spirit better, like what their age was, when they died etc, &quot;S&quot; began to bark questions at him.<br>
<br>
S: Are there aliens?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
S: Are they good?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do they want to eat us? (being slightly irritated at S)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We all thought on what he said.<br>
<br>
C: Are you fooling us right now?<br>
Board: Yes (circles Yes)<br>
<br>
C: Ok, you're a funny spirit.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you having a good time talking with us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We found out that he died at the age of 90, and was a spirit for 1 year. Also that he was African American when he was alive, and he doesn't like what Obama is doing, and he doesn't like McCain either. The board went on telling us about his political views. It was rather amusing, needless to say.<br>
<br>
Me: So, is there anything you have to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Which one of us? You can use the numbers to make it easier: 1 is for &quot;S,&quot; 2 is for &quot;C,&quot; 3 for me, and 4 for &quot;G.&quot;<br>
Board: 1, 2, 3, 4 (then the planchette points at C, me, and G and goes off the board to S (who will not even touch the planchette)<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, it's for all of us then.<br>
Board: yes, 01010102<br>
<br>
C: Wait a minute, the last spirit said those were the lotto numbers.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What does 01010102 mean?<br>
Board: 01010102<br>
<br>
C: Does this have to do with XIX?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
C: Are you fooling us right now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Is 01010102 good?<br>
Board: No, BAD<br>
<br>
C: Does this have to do with the Y, the split tree?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this about 2012?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
C: Is it about 2019?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
C: So seven years after 2012 is bad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We tried to figure out what he was trying to tell us for awhile, but got no where. He began to get tired, and we asked him not to follow us home, and to have a nice day.  He said goodbye.
<br><br>
So we really don't know what he was trying to say about 01010102. Because he totally contradicted what the other spirit said. Now this week I got my own board, and my family is down for my college graduation.  I talked my mom into buying me one for graduation. So my neighbor friend was over, my mom, and me and we began. I lit a few white candles (to see if it had any effect, because at the college we couldn't do this.) We were able to speak to a few different spirits.
<br><br>
Me: Do you have anything to tell us?<br>
Board: 01010102<br>
<br>
Me: Have you talked to me before on a talking board?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Is this your first time?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
I was pretty creeped out because I never told my mom or friend about 01010102. I want to know - has anyone else gotten this message from the Ouija? If you have gotten this number too, please let me know.

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments about Patricia's story, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a>, and I will forward it on.
