On April 9, 2006 I received an e-mail from Camille Marquez about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This was about 3 months ago, when my cousin and I were playing with the Ouija board. She was at her friend's house, and I stayed at her house with my mom and my sick grandpa. My cousin then came home and brought the game. We started to play with it because she told me that she talked to someone with her friends...they said that something was wrong with my grandpa. She got
really freaked out and stopped.  When she told me that, I told her she should continue to play with it, but with me.
<br><br>
When we started playing with it, it took a while to start.  Once we asked for its name and information, we then asked it a question that shouldn't be asked...We asked it when my grandpa was going to die.  It said &quot;soon.&quot; We got really freaked out, and then 10 minutes later our grandpa had a heart attack. We called an ambulance.
<br><br>
When everyone was at the hospital, me and my cousin started to play with it again.  We asked it if my grandpa was going to live. It said &quot;maybe&quot;, and we were really worried. Then it started writing out my initials, and then my cousins initials. We got
really freaked out, and then it said &quot;call me.&quot;  I asked who we were supposed to call, and then it said &quot;CM call me&quot;. The only person who I thought would want me to call would be my mom, so I called her. She said that she had been wanting to call me, but for some reason the phone didn't work. She also told me that my grandpa was okay, but he would be in the hospital for awhile.
<br><br>
My grandpa died a month after that...&quot;
