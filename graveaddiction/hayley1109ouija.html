On November 2, 2009 I received an e-mail from Hayley about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It was October 30th, the day before Halloween, when I went to my friend's party.  When everyone got there, she pulled out a ouija board.  We had always talked about them, but never agreed to plan a date to go buy one or make one.  Now there was one right before our eyes.
<br><br>
We turned off all the lights but one, and placed the board on a coffee table. We came in contact with a spirit right away.  At first we thought he said his name was Tarzan, but later found it was Tarson.  Nothing overly exciting happened. All we knew was Tarson had a brother who was killed by someone he didn't want to share with us. We went home, and by the next day we had a date planned out to try to learn more.
But this time only 3 of us, me (Hayley) and my two friends Leah and Olivia. We came in contact with a guy named Jue, so here's our conversation.
<br><br>
Leah: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Are you going to harm us?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Do you by any chance know Tarson?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: How?<br>
Board: Brother.<br>
<br>
We were all pretty shocked right now!<br>
<br>
Hayley: Was Tarson older then you?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia:....<br>
Hayley: How many years older was he?<br>
Board: 10.<br>
<br>
Olivia: How were you killed?<br>
Board: Fight.<br>
<br>
Leah: About what?<br>
Board: Fight (then goes to yes and then no)<br>
<br>
Hayley: Does that mean your not sure?<br>
Board: Marriage.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Is that what the fight was about?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Who killed you?<br>
Board: Tarson (really slow now) wife.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Okay, that's enough, thank you.<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Okay, now here's the part were we all got a bit spooked, that was nothing ; )<br>
<br>
Leah: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes (apparently)<br>
<br>
Leah: What's your name?<br>
Board: Gus<br>
<br>
Leah: Are you a boy?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Is that a short form?<br>
Board: Yes, Gustella.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Are you in anyway related with Tarson?<br>
Board: Yes, wife.<br>
<br>
Hayley: If you don't mind me asking - did you kill Jue?<br>
Board: Yes fight.<br>
<br>
Leah: Over marriage?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Hayley: Did you mean to kill him?<br>
Board: -goes between yes and no-<br>
<br>
Leah: Are you in the room with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Leah: In one of these chairs?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Which one....<br>
Board: End.<br>
<br>
Leah: Do you wanna sit next to me?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: Okay, now I have to go for a few minutes.  Can Hayley sit here and take over?<br>
Board: Ok.<br>
<br>
Hayley: ....<br>
Olivia:....<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Hayley....<br>
Olivia: Did you say anything?<br>
Board: Yes no yes no -bunch of letters-<br>
<br>
Leah: I'M BACK!<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: Want Hayley to stay holding the pointer?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: So what's up?<br>
Board: -points at boxes of apple tarts Leah has brought in-<br>
<br>
Hayley: Does she want one?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: Okay -places a tart in front of her-<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Leah: Can we see you while you eat it?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Leah: So were you a human in your past life?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Leah: An animal?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: What kind?<br>
Board: Wakeded.<br>
<br>
Leah: You mean a whale?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: -giggles-<br>
<br>
Okay so we ask a bunch more questions about like am I going to fail my french test, etc when Leah's brother comes down.<br>
<br>
Leah's brother: Oh so you got that stupid thing to work?<br>
Leah: Shh.<br>
Hayley: Nicolas...<br>
Board: -pointer almost goes off the board pointing at him-<br>
<br>
Hayley: Do you want to talk to him?<br>
Board: No -goes to no like five times-<br>
<br>
Nicolas: WOW YOU STUPID GHOST, YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ME, I CAN TALK TO YOU IF I WANT.<br>
Board: -goes dead still then goes to the top of the board like its trying to escape-<br>
<br>
Hayley: Um, say sorry, Nicolas.<br>
-Okay, let's keep in mind he's a 9 year old-<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
-we ended the session-<br>
<br>
We later talked to someone else, andwe asked if we had talked to any bad sprits.  It said yes, Gus. Why? She's a killer.
<br><br>
Dun dun dun dun.
