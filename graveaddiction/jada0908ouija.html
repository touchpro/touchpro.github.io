On September 7, 2008 I received an e-mail from Jada about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I recently stumbled across your webpage, and was wondering if you or anyone you know can help me. See, when I was around 14-15 my mom and my then best friend thought that it would be a good idea for me to buy a ouija board. So I bought it and took it home, feeling a little freaked out but excited. My mom had told me stories about the times when she and her friends had played, so I was getting more curious.  I tried to play with my friend, but she would always end up moving it on purpose and laughing. So I decided one night, while alone in my room, to play. I didn't exactly know what I was doing, but I played anyway. So nothing happened for a while and I grew bored...I think that I just stared at it for a while. Suddenly (and I'm not making this part up), my old baby toy clown doll wound itself up and started playing. Now my old toy had been broken for years, you just couldn't wind it. So I'm staring at it, and then it starts to play. So I yell for my mom and she comes in and sees it playing too. I told her what happened, and she told me to put the game away. Well, I did and the doll never did that again, even after I tried to wind it. So it's been a few years, and ever since that time I have always felt like I was being watched or followed. Sometimes I can feel a strong presence and sometimes very faint, but I'm still freaked out and would like to know what I can do? I still have the game and have since looked at it but never played it. And keep in mind that we've moved four times since then and live in another state. Please help!

If you have any advice or comments for Jada, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to her.
