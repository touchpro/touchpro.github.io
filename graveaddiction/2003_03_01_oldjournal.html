Today I left work about an hour early.  We had a celebration at Gameworks for one of the projects we implemented.  We've had celebrations for projects before, but unlike the others I've been to this one was fantastic!  Usually attendance at these celebrations is absolutely terrible, but there were a lot of people there this afternoon.  Plus, we got free game cards and two free tokens for beer and wine.  Not bad!<br /><br />It's been raining all night.  But that's not bad, I love the sound of rain.  Also, there was some lightning and thunder...that makes rain even better!  Maybe the rain will make me sleep better tonight.  I've been having an awful time falling asleep recently (worse than usual), and I'm not sure why.  Then when I do fall asleep my dreams are really strange...stranger than usual even!  However, I can't remember most of them after I wake up.  I really need to keep a journal or notebook by my bed so I can write the dreams down immediately after waking up.  I'd really like to study them to see if there's any meaning to them.<br><br>

This afternoon one of my coworkers, Jason, stopped by and told me to check out his band's site, <a href="http://www.toggle-online.com">Toggle</a>.  He created a new flash intro for the page as well as a new photo slide show that he wanted me to check out.  I also noticed that he added a mailing list to the site.  I commented on it, and he said it didn't work yet since he hadn't found a script to run it with.  So I told him about the form mail script I use on <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a>.  I even submitted the form and logged into my e-mail to show him what the generated e-mail looked like.  Then he went back to his desk.  Several minutes I realized that he may have glanced at some of the other e-mails in my Grave Addiction e-mail inbox...one of the e-mails had the subject "Lakin Psychiatric Hospital".  I then ran over to his desk laughing to explain that no, I'm not planning to check into a psychiatric hospital or anything like that...I'm just planning to explore an abandoned one!  I wanted to make sure no awful rumors got started about me!  It wouldn't have been a big deal had it been one of my close coworkers that saw it, they all know about my cemetery and abandoned building fetish.  However, some of the coworkers I don't talk to about personal (non-work) related things might not know about that.  Gossip spreads through my team really fast.  The psychiatric hospital rumors wouldn't have been near as bad as the rumors that started last year when Sheri left her ultrasound pictures laying on my desk!!<br /><br />Really, today was a pretty decent day at work for a Monday and all.  Except for the temperature...it was extremely hot, it resembled hell's temperature again.  I turned on my fan, but all that did was make things worse.  Not only was it hot, but I'm working on statements right now and the fan blew the stacks of paper on my desk around.  It was a mess!  I shouldn't complain though, things could have been worse...I could have spilled my cup of water all over my desk like I did last Friday!<br /><br />I got all but one roll of film back from Cord Camera tonight.  I'll pick up the roll of black and white pictures tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll get the new pages out on the site by Friday.<br><br>

I have been just TERRIBLE at updating this blog lately...I'm going to try and update it more often this week!  <br /><br />I'm so happy that spring is here.  A lot of the perennials in my garden have started to come up already.  So far it looks like I have the following plants coming up from last year:<br /><ol><br /><li>Columbine<br /><li>Catmint<br /><li>Carnations<br /><li>Roses (which really suprises me since I'm not very good at growing them!)<br /><li>Cup and Saucer plants (not the vines)<br /><li>Black grass<br /><li>Turkish Oregano<br /><li>Oregano Thyme<br /><li>Purple Sage<br /><li>Regular Sage<br /><li>Hollyhocks<br /><li>Hostas<br /><li>Apple Mint<br /><li>Candy Mint<br /><li>St. John's Wort<br /><li>Rue<br /><li>Cabbage plants<br /><li>Stonecrop<br /><li>Bleeding Heart<br /><li>Snowstar<br /><li>Vinca vines<br /><li>Some plant I can't remember the name of<br /></ol><br />So it looks like I may not have to buy many plants this year!  I have also planted a bunch of seeds that are starting to come up.  I just started a few of them on Friday night and they're already sprouting.  Gardening really is my favorite thing about warmer weather!<br /><br />Yesterday I took pictures of a few more cemeteries and two covered bridges: Johnston Bridge and Mink Hollow Bridge.  I almost always take pictures of the signs in front of cemeteries and parks so I can make sure I get the spelling right.  I also put the pictures of the signs out on the site.  I think the sign in front of the Johnston Bridge will make people laugh...some kid decided to spray paint the word "big" on it, so now the sign reads "Big Johnston Bridge".  Too funny.<br /><br />I went to two cemeteries today to finish off the film I started yesterday.  I'll get all 5 rolls back tomorrow, but it'll probably be Thursday or Friday before I get everything added to the site.  <br /><br />Only a couple more weeks until Mark and I make the trip to Point Pleasant, WV to do more exploring of the TNT area and the Lakin State psychiatric hospital.  I can't wait!  And I still can't believe we're actually going to make the trip in April.  I thought it'd be June before we made it down there since Mark has that rule about not going outside for any length of time before it's at least 70 degrees.  <br /><br />This weekend went way too fast, I'm not ready to go back to work tomorrow.  Hopefully the week will go fast!<br><br>

I had an exciting weekend...on Saturday I went on my first trip with the Ohio Exploration Society.  We went to the abandoned <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/jcp.html">Junction City Prison</a> which is in Junction City, Ohio (I thought it would be obvious that it was in Junction City since it's in the name, but a lot of people at work today asked "Where is it?" so I decided to specify that here!).  It was so exciting!  There were four of us total and we spent a couple hours exploring the prison, guard tower, and brick plant.  It was fun, but it was also filthy.  I felt absolutely gross afterwards, all I wanted to do was take a shower so I could wash all of the flour (from the old pizza place that used to be there in the early 1990's) and who knows what else off of me!  I'd like to go back again sometime at night, I bet it'd be a really creepy place when it's dark...it was creepy enough during the day!  You can see the pictures I took by <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/jcp.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />After we explored the prison I took them to <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/stonewall.html">Stonewall Cemetery</a> in Lancaster since they had never been there.  We ran into a couple other urban explorers there, which was interesting.  We spent over an hour at Stonewall talking.  It really was fun, and hopefully I'll get to go on more explorations with them soon!<br /><br />I needed to take a few more pictures to finish up the last roll of film I took at the Junction City Prison so I went to <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/greenlawn.html">Greenlawn Cemetery</a> since I can always find things to take pictures of there.  I think I may have taken my first ghost photo...it shows up better in the actual copy than it does in the scanned copy, but there's a strange mist over the top and front of the supposedly haunted Gay Mausoleum.  At first I thought it must just be the sun or something, but after studying it closely I've decided it's not the sun...<br /><center><br /><img src="http://www.graveaddiction.com/greenlawn/greenlawn18.jpg"></center><br /><br />Wednesday Ryan, John, and Amanda are coming over to try out the new Ouija board with me...a "contact the dead" party!  I can't wait to see what happens!!!<br /><br />Tonight I had to clean the African Clawed Frog tank AGAIN.  I just cleaned it a week or two ago.  But it never fails...each spring when the weather starts to get warm for the first time the tank always starts to stink, even if the water doesn't look dirty.  It was so bad last night that the smell kept me awake, so the first thing I did tonight after work was clean it so I can hopefully sleep better tonight.  I'm sure it wasn't quite as bad as I made it sound.  I seem to be overly sensitive to aquarium odors.<br /><br />I have been having terrible foot cramps all night.  Which makes sense since they're calling for rain the next few days!  Speaking of foot cramps, I've been getting quite a few hits from people doing searches on things like "foot cramps", "foot cramps and weather", "foot cramps and driving", etc.  I never thought anyone would find my blog searching for that, but it's comforting to know that there are others out there who understand just how painful foot cramps are.  I remember <a href="http://sdominick.blogspot.com">Sharon</a> commented after my first foot cramp related entry, and she said she has had them too.  Now I know that it must be pretty common.  I'd really like to talk to the person who searched for "foot cramps and weather"...I'd like to know if he/she also has a "weather toe" that predicts when the weather is going to change.  And if they do, I'd like to ask him/her if his/her family finds it as humorous as mine does!!<br><br>

This week has gone fast...and it's about time I've had a week like this since the past 2-3 have been the exact opposite!!  <br /><br />Let's see, what's been going on?  Well, last night I had dinner and hung out with Chrissie.  That was fun.  I also heard from Kate, another person I went to high school with.  I hadn't talked to her for a long time...back in May of 1999 we had a big argument that started because of a disagreement over bridesmaid shoes.  The fight turned out to be about a lot more though.  After that I really didn't talk to her much.  Chrissie found <a href="http://www.johnandkate.com" target="blank">her wedding website</a> a couple of weeks ago and sent it to me.  The website doesn't have her e-mail address, but I got it from an e-mail that Mandy sent.  I really wasn't sure that Kate would e-mail me back, but she did.  It was kind of interesting to hear from her.  But like most of the people I know from high school, I really don't have much in common with her anymore!  I haven't e-mailed her back, I need to do that!<br /><br />There's a chance that I may get to go on my first exploration with the Ohio Exploration Society this weekend.   I'll be sure to write about it if we end up going.<br /><br />I still haven't scanned the new cemetery pictures...I don't know what's wrong with me this week, I've just been a terrible webmistress (or as my mom says, maybe I'm a webamatrix!).  I did get the Ouija board stories out on Grave Addiction.  They're the same ones I wrote about in this journal, but if you want to check them out, <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/ouija.html">click here</a>.  I also put a very high level, condensed version of the hauntings in my apartment on that page as well.  I still plan to write about both the hauntings and the Ouija stuff in this journal as well as the page on Grave Addicition.  And speaking of Ouija board experiences,  John, Ryan, Amanda, and myself are going to contact the dead using the new board next week!  I'll be sure to blog about it ASAP next week!<br /><br />Tonight Katy, my sister, came over after her class for dinner.  That was fun.  After dinner we went to Media Play so Katy could get a CD she wanted and so I could get a copy of the new Jeffery Deaver book, <i>The Vanishing Man</i>.  His books are awesome, the plots are always so good, and even I have trouble figuring out the answer to "who did it" before the last few chapters!  I read an interview online and he said this is one of his twistiest plots yet...I can't wait!!!<br><br>

My Ouija board FINALLY came in the mail today!  It was really worth the wait though, it's beautiful.  And it's really big, a lot bigger than my board from the 1960's!  Hopefully I'll get a contact the dead party planned soon so we can try it out.  The ghostly activity around my apartment has started to pick up again now that I have the new board here.  The usual things were moved, and the planchette has also moved.  I sat it on the left side of the board, now it's on the right.  Just to be sure I didn't make a mistake I moved it back to the left side, left the room...and when I came back it was on the right side again!  I can't wait to try it out!!!!<br /><br />I haven't blogged for awhile because I really haven't been up to much.  I'm working on statements and confirms testing through the end of the month, which isn't too exciting.  S&C is challenging and there are more than enough defects to keep us busy, but it still seems boring sometimes...looking at paper, finding defects, getting paper cuts, etc.  Thursday I might get to go on a "field trip" to our document services area in Grove City.  That's where all of the statements are printed.  They have new envelopes, and Deidee is going to make sure the machine handles stuffing them OK or something like that.  She knows how much I love learning about the machines there, so I may get to go too!  Last time I learned how to use the binding machine, the machine that binds big stacks of paper with those white plastic bands.  I had a blast with that, I bet the envelope stuffing machine would be even more exciting!  I know I sound pathetic, but it's the little things that really do make work seem bearable!  And it really is a lot more interesting than it sounds :)<br /><br />I have lots of new pictures to add to <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a>, I just need to find the time to scan them and put them on the site.  Here are the new pages I'll be adding sometime this week:<br /><ol><br /><li>Alton Cemetery - Alton, OH<br /><li>Old Franklinton Cemetery - Columbus, OH (this may be the oldest cemetery in Franklin County!)<br /><li>Gundy Cemetery - Columbus, OH  <br /><li>Sugar Creek Baptist Cemetery - Washington Court House, OH<br /><li>Bethel AME Cemetery - Frankfort, OH<br /><li>Mount Union-Pleasant Valley Cemetery - Chillicothe, OH (famous for Elisabeth's grave, which is haunted)<br /></ol><br />I also took pictures of the mounds at the Hopewell Culture National Park in Chillicothe.  I went down to Chillicothe and Frankfort last Friday.  I needed a day off to keep my sanity (since there's not much left I can't afford to lose any!), and the drive to Chillicothe sounded fun.  <br /><br />I've been having some really weird dreams lately, and as a result I haven't been sleeping too great.  I think I'm going to call it a night and log off the internet to see if I have better luck sleeping tonight!<br><br>

Yesterday I just had to get out of the house, but I didn't feel like shopping (I rarely feel like shopping, so that's nothing new).  So I decided to take pictures of a few more cemeteries for <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a>.  I added two new pages:<br /><ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/glabbey.html">Greenlawn Abbey</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/mtcalvary.html">Mt. Calvary Cemetery</a><br /></ol><br />I also added a few new pictures to the <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/greenlawn.html">Greenlawn Cemetery</a> page.  It felt great to get out of the house, even though it was really cold.  I also went to two more cemeteries tonight: Alton Cemetery and the Olde Franklinton Cemetery.  I'll probably get those pictures added to the site later this week or early next week.<br /><br />Other than that, I don't have anything exciting going on.  Today was an exhausting day at work, hopefully the rest of the week will go by better and faster!<br><br>
