On November 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Jenna about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Jenna, and I just turned 13.  I had a birthday party with some friends to celebrate. I had around 10 people over that night, and we were bored so we decided to play with my mom's 40 year old oujia board. We all wanted to play, except for Danika.  So she stayed out with my older brother and his friends.
<br><br>
We dimmed the lights and set out the oujia board on my floor. Some of us had never played it before, so Regan, whose family is Native American, started the questions because her family is very &quot;in touch&quot; with spirits.
<br><br>
Regan: Who is the spirit that is with us tonight?<br>
Board: i....v....y<br>
<br>
Regan: Ivy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We paused for a minute to think about some questions we could ask...we all decided to ask a couple questions about boys since we were so bored.
<br><br>
Me: Give us the initials of a boy who likes Catherine<br>
Ivy: s.........y<br>
<br>
Me: S Y?<br>
Ivy: Yes<br>
<br>
Catherine: Seth...
