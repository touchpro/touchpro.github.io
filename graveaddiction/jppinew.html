<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana">Jeff Powers sent me the following e-mail about Pinewoods Cemetery:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i> I thought I would share my pics and the story of this cemetery in my area. This is the Pinewoods Cemetery, also known as Forest Hill Cemetery, located in Troy, New York. This cemetery has a history of it's own as being haunted. It was claimed as one of America's most haunted cemeteries. Years ago, a psychic came to investigate it and said that this cemetery was built upon an Indian burial ground and there had been alot of paranormal activities there. After the discovery of paranormal activities there, no new bodies were interred there ever since.
<br><br>
I took these photos in the fall of 2003 with a small group of people. This place does have an eerie look. I went there around 12 midnight until 2 AM. I have not heard any apparitions or noises (except for one - there was a slow snap of a tree twig on the ground in the distance not too far from me). For years, this cemetery has been in great disrepair since the two businessmen from New York City took ownership.  Later they did not have any more money to upkeep it, so they abandoned it. This cemetery is now in the hands of a neighboring town, and they have been trying to get someone to take it over.
<br><br>
There had been rumors about baby cries heard in the back of the cemetery.  One statue that was called the 'bleeding statue' because blood was coming out of the eyes and possibly from the neck. The cemetery had been vandalized by a group of teenagers. There were also reports of seance performed there by the devil worshippers. Rumor has it that apparitions were seen and strange things were felt. After reading the stories of others that had experienced their expeditions in there, one guy had experienced a small pair of glowing red dots in the rear of the main mausoleum which he claims are &quot;red glowing eyes&quot; that kept moving back as he moved forward to get a good look at them.  Another person experienced something bouncing off the tree above, back and forth in a parallel motion.  The tree is at the left side of the main mausoleum. This gave me the impression the there is something evil that is always on the left side of the mausoleum, and it is the exact location where I heard the slow snap of the tree twig! If you notice the two pictures showing the pentagram which happens to be on the left side! Very eerie! There were none on the right side. I heard a story where a man and his girlfriend back in the late 1940's drove in there at night and parked next to the big tree in front of the mausoleum. The man heard noises from the mausoleum and he decided to go investigate it, leaving his girlfriend in the car. He never returned to the car until his girlfriend heard a scraping noise on the roof of their car...she soon realized that her boyfriend was hung in the tree with his toes scraping against the roof of their car! She panicked and screamed until the police arrived. The police knew that they did not want to go in there. They told the girl to get out of the car and run quickly to them, so she did. The pictures here will explain what I have mentioned above. I plan to take more pictures of that cemetery soon. I hope you will find this one very interesting.</i></blockquote>
