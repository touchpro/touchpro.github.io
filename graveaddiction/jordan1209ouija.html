On December 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jordan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Today is December 24, 2009; the day before Christmas. The other day, my friends and I were messing with my friend's Ouija board. I only remember certain things about what happened, nothing particular like who said what.
<br><br>
My friend, Tre, is the owner of the Ouija board. He claimed to have a demon named Damian. I didn't belive him, so I decided that I wanted to play the game.
<br><br>
We used the board in the back room, there were two candles.  We started out asking if there were any spirits with us tonight - we continued asking as the piece did not move. Eventually it did. It was a six year old kid who had died around 1954. He died in a car accident. We asked whose fault it was, and he said his mother's. He explained how he did not like his mother, and that she had beaten him when she was alive. It was pretty sad that he mentioned that the wreck happened when she was picking him up from school, she was drunk. Devin was a very nice ghost.  He told me that he liked me because I was nice. We asked him a series of questions.
<br><br>
Did you live in this house? No<br>
Why do you live in it then? Didn't want to leave father.<br>
Who was your father? Dustin. (Dustin is my friend's (Karlee) cousin. He doesn't have kids right now.)<br>
Was he your father in a past life? Yes.<br>
Did you love him? Yes.<br>
<br>
He continuously spelled out &quot;I love Dustin,&quot; and claimed that he would not leave him.
<br><br>
We asked him if he liked all of us, he said no to only two people: Brenden and my friend, Rain.<br>
Why don't you like me (Brenden)? Stupid.<br>
He asked again. I said, he's pretty rude isn't he? Yes.<br>
Why don't you like Rain? Whore.<br>
The kid had never cursed before, seeing as he's 6.<br>
<br>
Is this Damian? Yes.<br>
Where did Devin go? Left.<br>
You made him leave? Yes.<br>
Are you going to hurt any of us? Yes.<br>
We asked, and separate times, if he liked us. He only said yes to Karlee.<br>
Why do you only like Karlee? Cute.<br>
Are there any other reasons? Yes.<br>
Why? She has my child.<br>
<br>
At a different session it claimed that it was a part of Tre, that Tre was Damian.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that we asked a few more questions, not remembering what they were. There were other parties in the living room, so we decided that we would go join them. Later on, we went back to the board, just me and Karlee.
<br><br>
Are there any spirits who would like to talk to us? Yes.<br>
Is this Devin? No.<br>
Is this Damian? No.<br>
Are you joking with us, Damian? No.<br>
So is this Devin? Yes.<br>
Why did you say no before? Joking.<br>
Do you like the music that we are playing? (A Day To Remember, I do believe.) No.<br>
What kind of music do you like? Baby.<br>
We presumed it ment baby music.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but we don't have the kind of music. Is it okay if we continue to listen to this? Yes.<br>
Did Damian make you leave before? Yes.<br>
Did he hurt you? Yes.<br>
How did he hurt you? No movement.<br>
Does he still want to talk to us? Yes.<br>
Are you going to allow him to? No.<br>
Why not? Dustin.<br>
You won't leave Dustin? Yes.<br>
Will you make this candle (on my right side, green) blow out? No.<br>
Karlee asked, &quot;Is it because you're lazy like Jordan?&quot; Yes.<br>
<br>
During the sesion, we were asking questions to Devin and what not. The green candle's light began to flicker extremely fast.<br>
<br>
Is that Devin who is doing that? Yes.<br>
Will you blow it out? Moved between yes and no.<br>
Is it hard? Yes.<br>
<br>
The light eventually blew out. We congratulated him, asked more questions, then quit the sessions. Some of them invloved my boyfriend, Brandon, who didn't want to be involved unless Devin was the one being asked.
<br><br>
I had asked who I was sitting by.  Brandon.<br>
If he liked him, yes. <br>
Why? Because he is scared like me. <br>
<br>
We quit the session since Brandon was also freaked out.<br>
<br>
Later on, Brandon and I went into the room that Karlee's two little brothers ususally slept in. Karlee claimed that Devin hung out in there, and she reported that her 5 year old brother, Mark, had talked to him once and a while. As we were laying down, our feet were at least 2 feet away from each other. Brandon told me to stop messing with his foot. I just looked at him, and I told him that I wasn't touching it. We were freaked out, and we walked to my house at two in the morning. I know damn well that he wouldn't make me walk in the freezing cold at two AM.
<br><br>
We eventually fell asleep. In the morning, he told me about a dream he had. Damian ended up dragging him into my bathroom closet.
That night we spent the night at Brandon's house.
<br><br>
We were watching a movie, and the lights were definitely off.  The switches were definitely all the way down. They were white lights, not colored, and they didn't give off a hint of any other color except for, yes, white. An hour or so into the movie, all of the lights behind his bed began to flicker extremely fast. We looked at them, and they was tinted blue. Though it's been only a few days, he still has dreams about Damian and Devin. It could be out of subconscious, I don't know. Whatever the case may be, I get creeped out once and while, but I've been reading my bible more than ever.
<br><br>
I didn't believe in God, just a higher power.  And now that I've been researching Ouija boards, and from that experience...I definitely believe in God.
<br><br>
I've read a lot, and I mean HOURS worth. I'm pretty much obsessed with Ouija boards now.  My friend Karlee and I are going to make one. =]
