On July 9, 2009 I received an e-mail from Brittany about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Brittany, and I'm using homemade ouija boards.  Here is my story.
<br><br>
Me:Our Father<br>
Which art in heaven<br>
Hallowed be thy name<br>
Thy kingdom come<br>
Thy will be done on earth<br>
As it is in heaven<br>
Give us this day our daily bread<br>
And forgive us our trespasses<br>
As we forgive those who trespass against us<br>
And lead us not into temptation<br>
But deliver us from evil<br>
For thine is the kingdom<br>
And the power<br>
And the glory, forever, Amen<br>
<br>
I don't want any bad spirits entering this board and none are allowed to enter.  If you are a bad spirit you may not enter, and only good spirits may enter.<br>
<br>
Does any entity want to speak with me?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: Quinn<br>
<br>
Me: May I record this onto my computer?<br>
Quinn: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Then I'm going to leave for a few moments.  May I say goodbye?<br>
Quinn: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Quinn: scared<br>
<br>
Me: You're scared?<br>
Quinn: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Don't worry, I'll be right back.  I promise.  Now goodbye.<br>
Quinn: yes.goodbye<br>
<br>
I go to the computer after flipping over the planchette and putting a silver dime on the board for good luck.  I type what has happened so far and go to communicate with Quinn more.<br>
<br>
Me:  Our Father<br>
Which art in heaven<br>
Hallowed be thy name<br>
Thy kingdom come<br>
Thy will be done on earth<br>
As it is in heaven<br>
Give us this day our daily bread<br>
And forgive us our trespasses<br>
As we forgive those who trespass against us<br>
And lead us not into temptation<br>
But deliver us from evil<br>
For thine is the kingdom<br>
And the power<br>
And the glory, forever, Amen<br>
<br>
Is Quinn there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: May I speak with her?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this her?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Quinn, you're female right?<br>
Quinn: Yes<br>
<br>
The phone rings.  It is Sarah.  I do not get it in time.<br>
<br>
Mom: Britt, it's Sarah!<br>
<br>
Me: I gotta go, I'll be right back. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
I move the planchette to goodbye and rush to the phone before calling Sarah back.  She doesn't answer.  I call again.  She still doesn't answer.  I turn on Audition to see if Jae (my bf) is on.  Audition has to download new patch first.  While waiting, I call Christina.  Nobody picks up the phone.  I plan to try and make up with Jae.  We had a fight before this.  Computer's being slow.  I contact on ouija board again.<br>
<br>
Me: Our Father<br>
Which art in heaven<br>
Hallowed be thy name<br>
Thy kingdom come<br>
Thy will be done on earth<br>
As it is in heaven<br>
Give us this day our daily bread<br>
And forgive us our trespasses<br>
As we forgive those who trespass against us<br>
And lead us not into temptation<br>
But deliver us from evil<br>
For thine is the kingdom<br>
And the power<br>
And the glory, forever, Amen<br>
<br>
Is Quinn there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this her?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: I didn't let you go by slipping off my fingers, did I?<br>
Quinn: No.<br>
<br>
Me: If I let go, will you come out?<br>
Quinn: No<br>
<br>
Me: Hold on.<br>
<br>
I shut my door.<br>
<br>
Me: May I ask how you died?<br>
Quinn: Gun shot.<br>
<br>
Me: You died by a gun shot?<br>
Quinn: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: One moment. Can you show me you're here?<br>
Quinn: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: You won't hurt, will you?<br>
Quinn: No<br>
<br>
Me: Alright. Hold on - don't do anything yet.  Okay, you can do something now, but I'm gonna let go.<br>
<br>
I begin to wait. One minute passes. I see the light flicker.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you make the light flicker?<br>
Quinn: yes<br>
<br>
Me: I'm gonna say goodbye now.  I'll come talk to you later, is that alright?<br>
Quinn: Yes<br>
<br>
I feel a tickling feeling on my arm.<br>
<br>
Me: Is that you touching my arm?<br>
Quinn: Yes. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
I end the session.
