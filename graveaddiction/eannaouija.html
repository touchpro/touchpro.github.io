On November 7, 2005 I received an e-mail from Eanna about her creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Me and my mates did the Ouija Board a few months back, and to cut a long story short, we did it 5 times. It predicted a lot of things.  Four times it was successful, but on the third time it was only me and one of the friends.  We set it up and started by asking &quot;Is anyone there?&quot;  The glass just moved off the table and fell to the ground. As soon as it hit the floor, the candles went out, the GAS fire went out, and the room went icy cold. We quickly tidied it up and went outside for a badly needed cigarette. The other four times it told us a load of stuff - some of it was true and some was not.
<br><br>
Anyways, after the &quot;third time&quot; weird stuff started happening to me and my friend, Sarah. Here are a few examples of what REALLY DID HAPPEN...
<br><br>
She woke up one day with marks all over her body, and she started to see all the people we contacted. For example, we contacted a 6 year old girl who was hung by her dad. She saw a girl's head in a car as we walked down town. Then she saw a man sitting in a van as clear as day. Now Sarah likes to present herself well in public, and never shows if she is scared, upset, or anything like that.                                                                                                                               But each time she saw someone, she would run as fast as she could, screaming down the street. That really suprised me and I knew she was telling the truth.
<br><br>
Someone took a photo of me and Sarah, and a man was in the photo standing behind us.  He must have been the spirit of Alan Welsqe, the first person we contacted.
<br><br>
My house got seriously haunted-- a newly built house!  I saw people walking around, footsteps going up the stairs, shadows, and even in bed I felt someone poking me. Things were flying off tables, counters, etc. The two of us did not sleep for days! We were both in bits, we jumped at the tiniest thing, our heads were fried from no sleep, and we were weak and scared stiff. I even fainted a few times when I saw spirits in my house, out of pure fear. I would also just break into tears from fear. I'm not making this up,  I have never felt such fear in my life.
<br><br>
They were everywhere we went, they really screwed us up. Finally we got help from a priest who blessed my house and the two of us. It has all ended now, but if it hadn't--I know for a fact we would have killed ourselves. But the weird thing is, there were five of us, but only me and Sarah were the ones who got screwed over. It must have been the third time we did it, when the glass went off the table. But there is one more thing it told me. It said my mum would die on the 10th of November 2005--today is the 7th. I'm a bit freaked, but I'm not preparing her funeral or saying my last goodbye!!! I doubt it will happen, it just messes you up. I think it all depends on the spirit you contact, if they are evil you're just gonna end up going insane. If it is good, it will speak the truth...the only problem is, knowing if the spirit is good or bad.&quot;
