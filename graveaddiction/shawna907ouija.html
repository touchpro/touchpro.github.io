On September 27, 2007 I received an e-mail from Shawna about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ok, my best friend Emmy and I (Shawna) {We were both 13} were on vacation together at my grandparent's house in the Thousand Islands (New York).  It was around ten o' clock pm labor day weekend (2007) and we were sitting on their dock with our feet in the water.  I asked her a question, and she didnt reply. I asked her what was wrong. She simply said &quot;Run.&quot; I said what do you mean &quot;Run&quot;? And she said &quot;There is a spirit next to you.&quot; I said &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Then the wind kicked up and a rock went flying and hit my feet. We ran into our tent. We made a ouija board out of paper and a shot glass.
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: {immediately} Yes<br>
<br>
Emmy: Who is this?<br>
Board: {Extremely fast} Juaq<br>
<br>
Me: Are you from Canada?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: So you're French?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Emmy: Are you good?<br>
Board: Kinda<br>
<br>
The wind picked up again and our tent was then hit with seven rocks (I counted the thumps and in the morning we looked on the ground).<br>
<br>
Me: Stop it.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Emmy: Why are you here?<br>
Board: Protect<br>
<br>
Me: Protect us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Emmy: Then why did you hit our tent?<br>
Board: Was not me<br>
<br>
Me: Then who was it?<br>
Board: Limbo *Pointed To Goodbye*<br>
<br>
We couldn't make anything of it really, but I started hearing voices in my head like shrieking and crying and the number 3 really stood out.<br>
<br>
The next day we went out in my canoe with our board and got nothing.<br>
<br>
That night:<br>
<br>
Emmy: Anyone wish to speak?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who?<br>
Board: Natasha<br>
<br>
Emmy: Were you the one on the dock?<br>
Board: No. Jack.<br>
<br>
Me: Don't you mean Jauq?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Board: X-Mas<br>
<br>
Me: The one me and my cousin talked to on Christmas?<br>
Board: Yes. Trapped in pendulum.<br>
(I did trap a ghost in my pendulum last Christmas and his name was Jack)<br>
<br>
Emmy: Then how could he have gotten out?<br>
Board: Idk but he did get out.<br>
<br>
Me:  OK then.<br>
<br>
Then the voices came back into my head, and this time they were singing a work song.  We started seeing shadows on our tent walls. It was very weird. I asked questions about this boy that I love dearly, and he loves me too, but were not together yet.  That night I had a dream about him. The two of us were walking down my street (in Newark, New York) and it was in black and white. We were holding hands walking silently, and everything on the side of the street would blow up behind us...the road would tear up too. We came to this platforn where it was lit by the sun and we stood on it. He hugged me and told me he loved me and I said &quot;You don't mean it today,&quot; and he said I love you and nothing will ever change that. And he gave me a necklace and stepped off the platform and turned into Emmy. Then we had that ouija session all over again. If anybody can interpret dreams, please let me know!
