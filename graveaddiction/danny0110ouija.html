On January 2, 2010 I received an e-mail from Danny about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A few years ago, I was on a school overnight trip and had one of the most frightening experiences of my life.  We all ended up in one room, where someone had a Ouija board.  Of course, we decided we'd give it a shot, and myself and another boy were the first two to move the piece.
<br><br>
Nothing was happening, and we were getting bored with it.  To make the entire experience a little more scary, we lit a candle and turned off all of the lights, so the room was mostly dark.  It was then things started to get interesting, and the piece began to move, seemingly on its own.
<br><br>
We started out with questions to test it - how old are we, what we did last week, and so on.  It was mostly hit or miss, until we asked how much money people were holding in their hands, where it got it correct every time.  I was moving the piece and couldn't see their hands.
<br><br>
Eventually, people got tired of this, and kept telling our visitor to show himself, and blow out the candle.  Every time we asked it to blow out the candle, it would immediately say no, although people claimed on seeing strange shadows, which I attributed to the candle.  We asked it to do something, and it spelled out &quot;W-I-N-D-O-W.&quot;  We moved the curtains and saw a long streak in the precipitation outside.  We closed the curtains, worried but not willing to stop.
<br><br>
After a couple more questions, we noticed that directly above the piece was extremely cold, and we began to worry.  I was especially jittery during the entire experience, and wanted to quit, so we moved the cursor to &quot;Goodbye.&quot;
<br><br>
Right as we took our fingers off of the cursor, the candle went out.  I won't touch one of these again.
