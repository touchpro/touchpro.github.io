On August 16, 2006 I received an e-mail from Tony Masiuk about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Can you use a ouija board with one person?  I have the answer to that...yes. Two or three days ago was sitting beside the sofa and trying to use the ouija board by myself.  The planchette started moving by itself, of course I was holding on, but my entire family didn't belive me. Here is what I said:
<br><br>
Me (Tony): Are there spirits here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Tony: How many?<br>
Board: 1<br>
<br>
Tony: What is your name?<br>
Board: Alak<br>
<br>
Tony: Quit joking around, tell me your real name!<br>
Board: Alak<br>
<br>
Tony: So Alak, how did you die?<br>
Board: (going from A to M)<br>
<br>
Tony: Is there something you need to tell me?<br>
Board: Zack<br>
<br>
Tony: Who is Zack?<br>
Board: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Tony: (I didn't say anything and the planchette was going faster and spelled out &quot;zack&quot; repeatedly)<br>
<br>
Tony: Do you like using ouija boards?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Tony: Have you talked to other people on ouija?<br>
Board: Yes, Zack.<br>
<br>
My arms got sore, so I left the conversation. As I said, nobody belived me when I told them that I used it by myself...even though my sister was watching. Everyone heard about it and accused me of pushing the planchette.  I had to prove it to someone, so when my dad got home from work I had asked him to try it because no one else thought it would work with only one person. So my dad tried it and he felt a force pulling the planchette too, but not as fast.  But they STILL did not believe me. They said everybody knows you need two people to use the Ouija. Based on my experience, I know they are wrong.
