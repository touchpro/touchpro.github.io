On March 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jac Moreau about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This happened a few years ago, and after finding your site recently, I decided to post my story, especially since I just bought a new board online.
<br><br>
Well, it was about three years ago, give or take, and my friends Laura-Mai and Eoin were at my place and we were so bored we decided to play with Laura's ouija board. At first we asked the usual questions, like what was the spirit's name (Brom,) etc. It started addressing me and this is where it got weird...
<br><br>
Board: Grandma<br>
<br>
Laura: Who's grandma?<br>
Board: Jac jac<br>
<br>
Me: My grandma? What's my granny's name?<br>
Board: MK (this is right, her name was Mary-Kate)<br>
<br>
Laura: What are you trying to tell us?<br>
Board: Phone call<br>
<br>
Me: My granny's gonna call me? Tonight?<br>
Board: No, tom (tomorrow)<br>
<br>
Laura: Did something happen? Is she okay?<br>
Board: Nothing happened. Okay<br>
<br>
Me: What time will she ring at?<br>
(planchette just circled the boarda little)<br>
<br>
Eoin: Can you show us if you're in the room?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Laura: Do it now?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
(We waited about two minutes, nothing happened)
<br><br>
Eoin: Did you do it already?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Laura: Do something else, do it in ten seconds, we'll count it out okay?<br>
Board: OK<br>
<br>
(suddenly, no lie, the TV switches itself on, and the door slams after Eoin runs out of the room)
<br><br>
Laura: (laughing) Okay, thanks.<br>
Board: No p. Funny.<br>
<br>
Me: (laughing) He thinks it's funny. Thank you, Brom!<br>
Board: Phone tomorrow<br>
<br>
Laura: Okay, we're saying bye bye now.<br>
Board: Bye<br>
<br>
The next day my grandmother didn't ring. She rang the day after. The first thing she said to me after we exchanged hello's was &quot;Were you at home yesterday?&quot;, and I said &quot;Yes, everyone was home all day, why?&quot;  She just said &quot;I rang twice yesterday and no one picked up the phone.&quot; I was so stunned I couldn't believe it. Weird or what?!
<br><br>
I didn't do ouija boards after that, and learned to read tarot cards which I'm quite good at. But I recently bought a new board, so we'll see what happens!!&quot;
