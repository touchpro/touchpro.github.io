<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana">Bright Cemetery is located on the east side of Havensport Road, just north of Bish Road, outside Baltimore, Ohio (Liberty Township, Fairfield County).  The coordinates are 39&deg; 49' 54.9&quot; N, 82&deg; 40' 23.74&quot; W.
<br><br>
Bright Cemetery is very old, and it is no longer active; the most recent grave is dated 1974.  There are several old gravestones, but unfortunately, many have been damaged by vandalism.  The township has done some restoration projects, but there are still many broken (and missing) monuments.  The grounds are well maintained.
<br><br>
In August 2004 I received an e-mail from Zach Low, a website visitor.  He had a very interesting story to share about an encounter his dad, his sister, and his sister's friend had near Bright Cemetery:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>They were driving along Havensport, slightly after nightfall, headed towards Bright Cemetery. At some point, my dad's car drove over something in the road. He came to a complete stop and all three got out to inspect what small animal he had probably killed. What they found was no dead rabbit, but rather something more disturbing and perplexing; a pentagram, a five point star, shaped out of some sort of fencing or metal, just lying in the middle of the road. They got back in the car, the girls (and even my dad, who probably used it to add to the tale) probably disturbed, but continued with the trip anyway. When they got closer to the cemetery, something else very strange happend. My dad swears he saw three figures, dressed all in white, moving around the cemetery. He had to blink to make sure he wasn't just seeing things, but they were still there.
<br><br>
Now, I've explained about his imagination and how it probably could have gotten the best of him that night, but I asked him to swear that what he saw was real, and he seems sure of it. He'd never lie to me about anything, even more so, not about something like this, I'm sure. 
<br><br>
When they all told me this, I was skeptical, as I imagine you might be now. I'm still not positive that the pentegram is not just some story they made up to add to the mystery and suspense that the family has given to that old road and graveyard. They could be trying to get the best of me, sure. But I do believe my father about the figures. There wasn't a lie in his eyes, if you understand what I mean. I'm also not sure that the star in the road was just some local kids messing around or if it was something more. I haven't investigated at all myself, but plan to do so sometime before the summer ends.</i></blockquote>
<br>
I received an e-mail from Bonnie Conrad regarding Bright Cemetery in January 2009:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I wanted to let you know that the supposed pentagram said to be on a stone there is actually the warn print from a Civil War marker which was metal. I am so sorry that I did not take pictures of every stone in that cemetery, but I have some originals from the time I visited there and I also have a picture take in the 1890's of her grave and sent to the family. It was vandalized many years ago and a smaller stone replaced it. Now it looks like even that one is gone. I am appalled at the lack of respect for my grandmother who was a wonderful Ohio pioneer. If there are any spirits there it's because they are mad as hell at the vandals who have disrespected their burial spot.</i></blockquote>
<br>
I have some relatives buried at this cemetery, so I've done quite a bit of research on it.  If you're interested in seeing a list of the people buried here, please <a href="http://www.genealogybug.net/pick_fair_cems/bright/bright.htm" target="_blank">click here</a>.
