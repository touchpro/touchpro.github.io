On January 23, 2010 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is the continuation of the original story, &quot;Talking to a Friend in Hell.&quot; From my friend's e-mails to me:
<br><br>
Alright, this is probably the last bit of information I have as I rarely use the oulija board anymore.  I have realized a few things from extensive ouija board use.  First of all, the ouija board is not the portal, the portal is you, the human being.  You invite spirits to communicate with you by saying outloud, &quot;Is anybody there?&quot;  They have good senses in the spirit world, so they can hear you when you call on them outloud.  Your mouth, words, invites the spirits to talk to you, and also thinking about them draws them closer to you.  The ouija board is just a tool for you to use to communicate with spirits.  It has no special powers and you never needed a ouija board in the first place to contact spirits.  You can make a ouija board out of anything, or you can create anything as a communication device to talk to spirits.
<br><br>
Also, most of the spirits that you come in contact with are human spirits.  Very rarely will you come in contact with a non-human spirit.  Drew told me that when you are using the ouija board, you are contacting some parts of limbo and all parts of hell.  He said that most of the human demons/evil spirits that you talk to want to kill you, but I don't think that they are allowed to.  Also, the spirits are not inside the board.  When you are contacting spirits, they are either right next to you or in the same room with you.  They are already there and are not trapped inside of the board.  The more you talk to them, the more power you give them to move things and eventually show themselves if they want to.  When we first contacted Drew through the board, he kept wanting us to talk to him for long periods of time.  He later told us that he did that because talking to him gave him more energy/power.
<br><br>
Spirits can also use your hands (move your fingers), not much though from what I hear, as guides to write out words through you.  I learned that human spirits can do this as well, better known as automatic writing.  You can put your hand out and they can use it as a guide to write out words through you.  Some new information that Drew gave me is the clothes that they wear in hell. He said that you either wear the clothes that you died in, or you're given rags to wear, or you're forced to be naked.  One odd thing that happened recently was that all the glass cups in my house started shattering on New Year's Day.  I don't know what that meant as I didn't ask Drew about it on the board.
<br><br>
Also, you can not contact Satan through a ouija board. From what I've heard, you will need an old demon summoning book (which is hard to find and is a big book), to summon powerful demons and Satan, and also a mirror.  Any mirror will do, and I don't know the significance of a mirror but that is what I hear you will need.  Demons will come if and when they choose to. You can not control them or make them come to you, it's up to them. You can, however, talk to lower level demons through the ouija board, but for more powerful ones, you will need an old demon summoning book and a mirror. You have to know friends of the demons or else they may act hostile towards you or attack you.  I found out that's what calms down most demons.  Also, I know someone who said that they've summoned Satan, but I don't know how true this is. They said that he is black with a snake like body, but with arms and he is huge.  He has a goat head or a goat shaped face with a snake tongue, and his eyes look like cat's eyes. I don't know how true this is as Drew never described him to me on the board.
<br><br>
Ouija boards can be dangerous though because you may never know who you're talking to. Spirits lie a lot, and a lot of them like to pretend to be who you're trying to contact.
