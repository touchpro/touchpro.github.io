On February 26, 2010 I received an e-mail from Jan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>


Last year, in 6th grade, I was having a sleepover at my friend Gabby's house, and our friend Allissa was there too. Later on during the sleepover, they decided to play a homemade ouija board. I was too creeped out by it, so I didn't play it with them. So have you heard the rumor that animals can see ghosts and spirits? Well, I'm pretty sure now that that rumor is true. I was holding Gabby's cat on my lap as I watched them play. I can usually sense when a spirit or a ghost is around, because I get really paranoid, and I had gotten really paranoid just watching them, and the cat kept running away, and was scared out of its mind.
<br><br>
So back to the ouija board.  As we played it, this one spirit wouldn't leave us alone. I can't really remember the whole conversation, but I do remember the parts that creeped me out. It said it didn't want to talk to us, and tried to go to goodbye, but Gabby talked at it, saying: &quot;Well, if you want to leave right now, then why are you still talking to us?&quot;  And so the spirit didn't really leave us alone after that.
<br><br>
Later on, we went to bed, and the next morning, I watched them play again. This time, Gabby seemed to really annoy the spirit, but it was the one that wouldn't leave us alone. We left the ouija board, and we went into Gabby's room.  We hadn't done much by the time things got really creepy for me. I saw a shadowy human-like figure sitting in the corner, with its arms around its legs. I told Gabby, and when she turned around, she saw it too. We all got really creeped out, so we took Gabby's dogs for a walk, to try and calm ourselves down, and to get away from whatever it was. I felt paranoid throughout the whole walk, and when we got back, they decided to ask if it had been following or stalking us, because of course, that same spirit had come back to the ouija board again.  It said yes. That really freaked me out.  Then they asked it what they would be when they grow up. It said that Gabby will be a veterinarian, and when they asked it what Allissa will be, it started to flip out and it kept going to the letters no, no, no, no, no.  When they asked it what it meant, it started to spell: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  We were all confused by what it meant, but Gabby hasn't played a ouija board since.
