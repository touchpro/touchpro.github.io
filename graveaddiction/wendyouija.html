On July 20, 2005 I received an e-mail from Wendy Jackson about her terrifying ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Myself and four others have been using ouija boards for a while now, with great success.  But we used one at my house for the first time and we had a spirit come through as we were closing the board.  As we were saying the Lord's Prayer, it spelled out the word 'fuckoff' and said its name was 'devil'.  Then it spelled out 'dont worry i will be with you all go to hell'.  Then it tried to spell out the words devil over and over but we kept stopping it by pressing down really hard on the glass with our fingers.  The power in the glass was so strong it was scary, we closed the board best we could but the glass was still moving so we turned it over.  We tried another session the following night, and as soon as we put our fingers on the glass it tried to spell out the word 'devil' again, so we closed the board.
<br><br>
The next night we tried again and it was as though it was waiting...it spelled out my name, so we closed the board and have not tried since.  The following day I had scratches on my chest from nowhere.  One of my household members has seen a dark figure of a man run across my living room, and I awoke through the night to a doberman dog sitting at my bedroom door.  We had contacted the spirit of one of the people in the circle just before all this happened, it was supposed to be the auntie of hers. It was very strong and very nosey, and as the session was going on, two people quietly came in the room and the spirit asked straight away who they were.  It was answering questions to people outside of the ring and when we asked if it could blow out a candle, it spelled out the words 'i will if you will'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So we blew out a candle and the spirit spelled out 'happy birthday'.  The glass was really going for it and it flew off the table and smashed!  We quickly put another glass on the table and carried on, the spirit said it was sorry and a short while after we ended the session.  That's when the spirit spelled out 'devil', etc.  Please - can you advise on what we can do?&quot;
<br><br>
My first question for Wendy was whether or not they always use the board in the same house.  This is her response:
<br><br>
&quot;On this occassion I used the ouija at my home for the first time, normally we use it at a relative's house and we have never had a problem until now.  We have tried it twice since and whatever it is was waiting, because as soon as we started the ouija the glass went straight to the letter D, then to E, then to the V.  We knew it was trying to spell out DEVIL so we stopped it by pressing down on the glass.  But it was so strong that it was going round in circles making a figure eight, so we ended the ouija.  The same thing happened the following time, and it was all at my home.  But on the third attempt it tried spelling out DEVIL again, and then it spelled my name out. I freaked out and we closed the board.  Now we dare not do another, i want to do one, but start it knowing exactly what to say and do to make it leave.  Any ideas would be appreciated.&quot;
<br><br>
I told Wendy that I'd post her story here to see if anyone has any advice for her.  If you do, <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">e-mail me</a> and I'll forward it on to Wendy! 
<br><br>
I've already received some advice, so I thought I'd post it here so others can benefit from the tips as well.  The first tip came from Rebecca Castle:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I suggest to  bind that spirit and render it powerless.  If you don't have anyone to teach you how to do this, yell with authority, <b>I bind you in the name of (your higher power) be gone from this circle, leave this house.</b> Once should be enough if your higher power is stronger then the spirit...<br>
If you have no higher power, email me, let me introduce you to mine...&quot;</blockquote>
<br>
The next tip is from Mindy:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I just read your story, I am a Wiccan and I know a lot about this. I am also a ghost hunter.  What you have to do is this:  first close the gate, then bless it. Then you will have to cleanse your house...I don't know where you are to offer to come help!  If you don't cleanse the house, the demon will just possess the board again the next time you play it, and he will continue to haunt your home.  See, a demon is a lot different then regular spirits and polergeist demons.  Their one purpose is to take over, they will try to drive you crazy. They play with your mind so they can take over...you have to get it out!! My religion is different than yours, the way I bless my board and close gates are diffrent.  I draw a circle and do diffrent things. What you can do is pray, and still use salt...you can probably look it up on line for your religon, but you have to close, bless, then cleanse.  I wish you the best, my web site will be back up running soon - we are called the Investigators of Supernatural Phenomenon of Michigan (i.o.s.p.o.m) so you can look us up.  Give it a week for our website to be back up,  me and my team do wish you the best!&quot;</blockquote>
<br>
OxBananaBumxO also shared some advice:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;Just go grab some holy water and cleanse the room.  I don't think its a devil....all spirits have some sort of personality that you should be scared of.  Maybe that spirit was funny and a mean person, but I don't think it will harm anyone&quot;</blockquote>     
<br>
Peter Kent shared his input as well:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I've read many stories on what to do when this happens. I was once told that once a spirit is called, it
won't leave the board until all this blessing stuff happens. And maybe after that, the board should be burned.
<br><br>
About this being the devil, I honestly don't believe it was. You don't know who was controlling that glass. It could have been some mischievous kid playing with you.&quot;</blockquote>
