On February 18, 2006 I received an e-mail from Maria about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My cousins Danny and Francis (names changed) and I were on the ouija board last night.  The questions we mainly focused on were what college Francis was headed to when she graduates from high school and what people in her circle are and would be the most supportive/happy/jealous of her.  Danny is currently attending college, and I have already graduated, and we are in the process of grooming Francis to aim high and not do the same things the rest of our family has done.  In addition, this was Francis' first time using the ouija board, after much coaxing from Danny and I that it would be fine.
<br><br>
We opened up by asking for only nice and good spirits to communicate with us, and forbade any evil spirits from entering.  First of all, the ouija board was insistent that she would be accepted to Vassar, and that is where she would end up graduating.  The board also predicted that she would do well in high school in her advanced placement courses, tests, and class ranking.  It also predicted she would major in music and would play the French horn, which she does currently play.  She will meet the man she marries at Vassar, a 6'2 trumpet player.  It also said she would remain in New York after graduating Vassar, but would live in the city and play for the NY Symphony.  Francis was stunned by all of this.  I think that finding out this information will add to her ambitions and reaffirm her belief in herself.  We also proceeded to ask it, out of Francis' circle of associates, who would be the most jealous/supportive/happy for her ambitions and successes.  It spelled out names of people that Danny and I did not know, but of course Francis did.  This shocked her too, since these are people that she knows but has never talked about with us.   We also asked which members of our family would knock her dreams down and who would support her.  We had hunches, and the ouija board seemed to confirm many of them.
<br><br>
In an unrelated session a few days prior, Danny and I asked the ouija board for the winning lottery numbers for the Mega Million dollar drawing.  It gave us numbers which we never played, but a few days after that, Danny went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner and his fortune cookies had the very same numbers that the ouija board predicted days earlier.  Here is an example of a few of the questions that the three of us have asked the ouija board in the past:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Did Oswald act alone in Kennedy's assassination?  No.  C-I-A
<li>Was Jack Ruby paid to kill Oswald? No. F-R-E-E.
<li>Was there another shooter besides Oswald?  No
<li>Was Jack Ruby angry that JFK was killed, is that why he killed Oswald? Yes
<li>Why did the CIA want Kennedy dead? H-A-T-E
<li>Who is Carly Simon's song, &quot;You're So Vain&quot; about?  N-I-X-O-N
<li>The ouija board also spelled out the salaries of people that I work with at my job.
<li>The ouija board told me how much of a percentage of a raise I can expect next year.
<li>The ouija board predicted the salaries of Danny and Francis when they graduate from college.
<li>The ouija board told me that there are 3 men in my office who are attracted to me.  It spelled out two names, but withheld the third name from me.  When I insisted on the name it spelled out &quot;mystery&quot; and &quot;hahaha&quot;.
<li>Francis asked the ouija board if the auditorium of her middle school is occupied by a ghost.  The ouija board said &quot;NO&quot;, and then spelled out &quot;D-E-M-O-N&quot;.  I did not know that we should end the session if this happens. I just read that on your site today and I will make sure to follow through with that should it happen again.  Incidentally, this was the only reference to anything sinister.
<li>Was Michael Jackson guilty of the crimes he has been accused of?  Yes
<li>What exactly did Michael Jackson do to the kids? &quot;P-O-R-N&quot;.
<li>Is Michael Jackson gay? Yes.
<li>Will Michael Jackson ever receive the punishment he deserves?  &quot;Yes.  A-F-T-E-R-L-I-F-E&quot;.
<li>Does Jennifer Anniston hate Angelina Jolie?  Yes.  Will Angelina Jolie give birth to a boy?  Yes.  Will Britney Spears and Kevin Federline divorce?  Yes. (We asked these types of questions to help lighten the mood)
<li>Was the universe created through the &quot;Big Bang&quot;? No.
<li>Is Stephen Hawking in his right mind in his theories about the universe?  Yes.
<li>Are there forces in the Bermuda Triangle that causes planes and ships to disappear without a trace? Yes.
<li>Does it have anything to do with the Earth’s magnetic field? Yes.
<li>Did President Bush know about September 11 before it happened?  No. M-E-M-O.
<li>Did President Bush ignore a memo that would've helped to circumvent 9/11?  Yes.
<li>Will Osama bin Laden die within the next year? Yes.
<li>Will U.S. Forces be responsible for his death?  Yes.
<li>Will President Bush be able to claim credit for this victory? No.
<li>Will there ever be a black or female president? Yes. (When we asked for a name, it just circled and never spelled one.)
<li>Are there ghosts that haunt the 9/11 WTC grounds? Yes
<li>Does the ghost of John Lennon haunt the NYC apartment he used to live in? Yes.
<li>Does John Lennon ever visit England? No.
<li>Where else does John Lennon haunt?  M-A-N-H-A-T-T-A-N
<li>Where does George Harrison haunt?  H-O-M-E.
<li>We asked the ouija board about a murder that took place next door to the house Danny used to live in when he was growing up, but took place before he was born.  A 16 year old girl had stabbed her mother about 100 times.  The people who have lived there since have experienced sightings of the stabbed woman and other odd occurrences, all relayed to Danny’s family as the different people have come and gone.  No one family has stayed in the house for any great length of time, and it remains empty currently.  We asked if the woman’s ghost will ever leave the house.  The ouija board said No, H-O-M-E. We asked if the woman was sad that her daughter killed her.  The ouija board said No, A-N-G-R-Y.  We asked the ouija board if the woman still loved her daughter in spite of the murder.  The ouija board said No. We asked if the daughter was imprisoned.  It said NO.  We asked it if the daughter was out free.  It said yes.  We asked the ouija board where the daughter currently lived.  It said C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A.  We asked the ouija board if she regretted killing her mother.  It said No.
<li>We asked the ouija board what the most haunted city in America is.  It said O-R-E-G-O-N, S-A-L-E-M.
<br><br>
Needless to say all of the answers were somewhat informative, but there is a creepy feeling having this information.  It is almost as if we are not entitled to know certain things, like the CIA’s possible involvement in Kennedy’s assassination.  Even though this is something that is out in the open anyway, as far as people voicing their suspicions about the assassination, it is still odd to have this other worldly entity confirm it.  I want to say that we do not believe everything the ouija board says as being 100% true.  I think many of the things it answers are merely substantiating things we are implying to it, but I also have a feeling that many of the answers are accurate.  Because the entity that is giving us information is supernatural, I would assume that it would have insight on the great mysteries of the world.  I have a suspicion that different spirit identities are taking turns answering us that we are not talking to only one being.  We all voiced how odd it was to be lightly touching the planchette and feeling the actual force pulling and pushing on it.  Also, we always avoid asking questions about Christianity, Heaven, Hell, etc.  My feeling is, I know what my faith and beliefs are, and I do not want a malicious spirit toying with that and trying to convince me that things I believe in do not exist.  I think if you ask questions about your faith, you are implying doubt, and a sinister force would pick up on this and manipulate you.  We also avoid asking questions about the date and means by which we will pass away.  And also, when asking a yes or no question, we never ask why something is. The one time we did that, was when we asked a question about our future.  The answer was &quot;no&quot; and Danny asked, &quot;Why?&quot; and it spelled out &quot;D-E-A-T-H&quot;.  So because of that occurrence, I refrain from asking for any details.  A yes or no answer suffices for me, and I can fill in the blanks with my own assumptions of what may or may not happen in the future.

Most recently, about three weeks ago, we all three decided it was time for another session.  We lit a white candle and asked for only nice, good spirits to communicate with us.  We had fun for a while, asking trivial questions.  It seems like after about half an hour or so, maybe the &quot;spirit&quot; on the board became bored or tired with us because it was spelling things out painfully slow, and sometimes the answers did not make sense.  I asked one question and it said &quot;Be Careful&quot;.  The next few questions, of matters which were pretty light and not too serious, were answered by &quot;They’re here&quot; and &quot;they are watching you.&quot;  Francis got scared and we tried to sign off but the board immediately said &quot;No&quot;.  After we insisted, the ouija board finally said good-bye; Danny poured candle wax on the board and put it away.  I have noticed that when it comes to asking questions about insight into current matters, the board does well and seems more straightforward, but when asking questions about future matters and what will happen, the board seems more vague and unwilling to answer or spells things out that don’t make sense.  If it does answer, it turns out to be inaccurate, however the fortune cookie numbers seems to indicate that it can kind of see into the future but maybe mixes things up a bit.  I guess it all depends on who you happen to communicate with on a given day.  We have never asked for identities; we just &quot;sign on&quot; and say hello.  Although ever since that last time, we haven’t really messed with it much.&quot;
