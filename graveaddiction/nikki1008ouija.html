On October 29, 2008 I received an e-mail from Nikki about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I've lived in the same house all my life, and all my life I have felt like someone's watching me. Ever since my first Ouija board experience, things have been getting worse. A few days after my Ouija session, paranormal things started happening. One night I walked in the kitchen to get a drink, and the light above my kitchen table start flickering. That has NEVER happened before. I was pretty freaked out, so I left and the light was acting normal again...it just stayed on without any flickering.
<br><br>
Later that night, I was in bed...and out of nowhere I felt like something was pressing me onto the bed. I couldn't move and I could hardly breathe. I commanded it to leave in God's name and I could move again. The next day I was sitting in a chair that has a lever so you can choose to move the chair up or down, whichever is comfortable. While I was sitting in the chair, it moved down and no one pulled the lever. I started to get scared, so I told myself I wasn't ever going to use the Ouija again. But I lied to myself.
<br><br>
I went to my best friend's house, which was where my first Ouija session was, and for some odd reason I wanted to use the Ouija again. I felt guilty at first, but I continued to do it anyway. When I got home, I read more about Ouija boards and I noticed it said you always have to say goodbye to completely end the session. But I didn't know that, and I think a spirit(s) has followed me home. I kept reading and reading more about them and learned so much. I read stories until I had to go to bed.
<br><br>
I had the strangest dream that night. In the dream, I made my own Ouija board and started talking to this little boy, about 8 or 9 years old, and he seemed so sweet. I let him out of the board so he could roam my house. My parents thought he was a sweet boy as well. He would hug me and just treat me like I was his sister or something. Then all of a sudden, he started threatening me. He told me he was going to kill me on a certain day. I woke up from my dream in fear in the middle of the night. My heart was racing. I couldn't get to sleep, so I prayed until I fell asleep. The next morning I started thinking to myself, &quot;What if God was telling me something? What if he was letting me know that a spirit/demon will try to trick you into trusting it, and then it will harm you for no reason.&quot; In other words, don't trust the board.
<br><br>
So this time, I promised myself and the Lord that I would never do it again. But when it was morning, I wanted to do it again.  I broke the promise. I started doing the Ouija board every single weekend with my best friend's brother and sister. My best friend was not too fond of Ouija boards. She said they were evil. But I believe that since they are evil spirits/demons, there must be good ones too. When I got home, I again read Ouija stories until it was time for bed. I fell asleep really quick.
<br><br>
The next morning I woke up with a few scratches on my body, and I had no clue how I got them. Even though they started hurting me, that didn't stop me from using the Ouija. I kept wanting to stop, but I couldn't help myself. I finally realized I was addicted.
<br><br>
Last weekend I was doing Ouija with my best friend's sister, and I asked if the spirit we were talking to could touch me. It said to hang on, and we waited a minute. Then I felt this cool breeze on my right hand, and the room was hot so I knew it had to be the spirit. It was incredible. Later, my friend's sister fell asleep so her brother took her place. We ended up talking to a demon. Everytime the brother asked it a question, the planchette would point to me...try to get to me. We asked why it kept doing that, and it said it wanted to possess me. I knew it couldn't because I don't have a vulnerable spirit, so I wasn't scared or anything. The planchette kept moving to all four corners, and was just going crazy. We finally demanded that we talk to someone else, and it cursed at us and went to goodbye. Another spirit started talking to us; I forgot it's name. We asked what the demon was doing and the board replied, &quot;It was trying to possess you.&quot; I was relieved that it didn't succeed.
<br><br>
Later that night, I was with my friend sitting down. Out of nowhere, I started talking to myself in my head as if I was talking to someone. It had to be a demon or something inside my head...I wasn't sure. We kept arguing back and forth and cursing at each other. I thought I was going crazy. I kept telling it to leave, and it kept saying no. I finally passed out a little because I was so light-headed. I fell asleep later on that night (I had to wake up early). I went home the next day, and I was so fascinated by all these Ouija stories I read last week.  So again I read more until it was time for bed. I was in bed and it felt as if someone or something was laying in bed next to me. I put my hand in the direction where I thought someone was with me, and my hand got really cold. I started feeling something pressuring me onto the bed like last time. It was really hard to move. Then something started touching my legs, and it felt like a hand. It kept touching me all over. And something kept poking me. It stopped for about 2 minutes and then all of a sudden something grabbed my left ankle. I tried shaking my ankle a little bit, but whatever grabbed it would not let go. It didn't want to. I felt something poking and tickling my feet. Maybe it was trying to make me laugh? I don't know. I was terrified though. My whole shoulder became so cold that it felt like snow, but the rest of my body was warm. It felt as if it was a guardian angel watching over me. My arm finally got numb...but so did my left foot. Nothing else. The numbness went away, and I started seeing shadows of a little boy about 8 or 9 years old. I'm starting to think my dream is coming true.
