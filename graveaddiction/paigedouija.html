On April 9, 2007 I received an e-mail from Paige D. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
A friend of my sister was telling me about the ouija board, so I asked if I could try. She made one and we were talking to about 3:00, but I had to stop because I was shaking so bad. Anyway, I told my friends about it and none of them believed me.  I got pretty defensive and I said, &quot;I'll show you.&quot; So I went to my friens house and we made one and lit some candles.
<br><br>
We were calling Satan, and sure enough he came. We asked him to prove that he was real. You see, I thought my friend was doing it and she thought I was doing it, so we were kind of unsure. So he said ok and off we went.
<br><br>
First we asked him to put the lighter out that we were using to light the candles. And he did. But me and my friend were like, &quot;Well, that could have been good timing.&quot;
<br><br>
So then we asked him to move the shadows of the candles, but not the actual flame. Here's where things got freaky. The shadows were going HUGE and then disappearing. But the flame wasn't even flickering.
<br><br>
Then we turned her fan on, and then turned it off.  We asked it to stop the fan from working. It said it had, so we tested it out and the fan didn't work at all. He said they had somehow melted and exploded at the same time.
<br><br>
I wasn't so freaked out, except when a week later her dad had gone to get it fixed and the electrician had no idea what had happened to the wires.
<br><br>
Freaky stuff!
