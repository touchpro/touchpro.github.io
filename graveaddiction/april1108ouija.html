On November 9, 2008 I received an e-mail from April M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

On November 8, 2008, my friends and I decided to make an Ouija board from paper and test it out. The hostess's house was close to an abandoned hospital, but it played it in her backyard. We set it up right outside the tent we were to sleep in. We used an egg ring for a planchette, and the second it was on the board, my friends could feel it growing hot. My friends who played were: Natalie, Sabrina and Kiana (I think).
<br><br>
Natalie: Is there anybody with us?<br>
Board: Twitched a little, stayed still.<br>
<br>
Natalie: Is there anybody with us?<br>
Board: A-I-J<br>
<br>
Natalie: What does &quot;A&quot; mean?<br>
Board: No response<br>
<br>
Natalie: Are you screwing around with us?<br>
Board: (funnily enough) Yes<br>
<br>
Natalie: Okay then.<br>
Board: (Heading over to Goodbye)<br>
<br>
Natalie: You buttmunch.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Straight after, all the witnesses were scared out of their minds. I stepped up to the board next along with Tilly and Alex.
<br><br>
Tilly: Is there anyone with us?<br>
Board: Nothing<br>
<br>
Tilly: Is there anyone with us?<br>
Board: (Twitches)<br>
<br>
Then Natalie screamed out, breaking the concentration. Her camera had turned off and the memory card had come out. We all screamed and ran towards the house. Later we had to come back out, and we saw many pieces of paper littering the ground. We thought it was the board, but it was from a notebook that we could not identify. We later found the Ouija board far away from the spot we had done it, and we ripped it up.
<br><br>
This was my, and many others, first experience in the Ouija. I reckon we'll do it again at our school, since there have been many ghost sightings.
