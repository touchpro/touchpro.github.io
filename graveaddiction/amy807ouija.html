On August 7, 2007 I received an e-mail from Amy about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
It was August 2, 2007 (a Thusrday).   My friend Tara and I were bored and we were looking for a board game in my closest...then we saw my older sister's Ouija board. Our moms didn't like us dealing with that kind of stuff, so we ran to a park near by. We set it down, read the instructions, and lit a candle for fun. This was all at night and we were alone. I asked it to communicate with us a couple times, but it didn't work.  I was getting bored of trying, but Tara wanted to keep on going. So finally it worked for me. This is how it went:
<br><br>
Me: Hello<br>
Board: Hey<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: Trevor<br>
<br>
Me: Cool, I'm Amy<br>
Board: I know<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Board: Following you<br>
<br>
Me: How long?<br>
Board: Past 2 months<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: You'll find out soon<br>
<br>
Me: Umm...okay<br>
Board: Indeed<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 18<br>
<br>
Me: I'm 16.<br>
Board: Your friend is 16 too. Tara.<br>
<br>
Me: How did you know that?<br>
Board: I know everything about you.<br>
<br>
Me: Tara will talk to you now.<br>
Board: Okay Hi Tara<br>
<br>
Tara: Can you give us a sign?<br>
Board: Like what<br>
<br>
Tara: Something to do with this park?<br>
Board: Watch the swings and be prepared<br>
<br>
(The swings started to move back and forth, starting out slow then faster and faster and went crazy. Tara and I started freaking out, and then they suddenly stopped.)<br>
<br>
Tara: Why do you have to be so scary?<br>
Board: I'm an evil spirit<br>
<br>
Tara: Okay, well I don't want to talk anymore.<br>
Board: Wait<br>
<br>
Tara: What?<br>
Board: Go near the light<br>
<br>
Tara: No, bye.<br>
Board: See you later tonight!!!<br>
<br>
Tara told me what happened, so we slowly made our way towards the light...all of a sudden it flickered and smashed, we were so freaked out by now.  We threw the board in the trash and ran upstairs to watch TV. Tara grabbed some snacks, and I turned on the TV screen, then turned around and screamed. Tara turned around too and dropped all the snacks she was holding because on the couch sat the exact Ouija board we were just using. So we threw it out deeper in the trash can this time, and came back in...there it stood on the couch again!!! We burned it this time with a match and came back inside. It was really late so we decided to go to bed.
<br><br>
We both couldn't go to sleep...maybe because of the Ouija board, or maybe it was just really hot. So we went to go sit on the porch and we saw something go across the street really fast...it wasn't a car because it was long and skinny. My porch light flickered and then burst as it did before. I saw Tara's face turn white and she started shaking, pointing across the street.  I looked across and we saw an older guy sitting on my old neighboors porch, which we knew was Trevor because no one lived in that house and his skin was pure white. We started screaming and I think we both fainted because the next thing I remember my mom was looking down at me asking what was wrong.
<br><br>
If you decide to use a Ouija board, use it with caution.
