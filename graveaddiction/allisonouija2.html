On September 25, 2005 I received an e-mail from Allison Mariea about her creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I'm not sure if you'd consider this quite a story, but more as info. A while ago, me, and my two friends were just messing around on the Ouija board. We asked stupid questions, just being selfish about ourselves. Such as, when we were going to die, where were we going to die, etc. So...as the night went on, Jessica (one of my friends) had asked it questions about her and all. She had said something about how she was going to die or something of that matter, it was a while ago. But, anyways...
<br><br> 
It had said something about two boys, a curb, and a truck. We all just laughed it off, and left the room, and went to go eat. It was about 2:45 AM. We kept hearing strange noises but just ignored the fact that it could just be the house creaking. We were all tired, so we went to sleep. All I heard that night was Jessica's movement and her kind of mumbling in her sleep, which was real odd for her.
<br><br> 
But, the next morning we all woke up. The question we still ask is why Jessica was the only one with strange and painful marks on her arms and legs and back. We all were freaked out.
<br><br>
I didn't think about it, to this day. But, last May, my friend Jessica died in a car accident.  I put the puzzle together of the Ouija board...
<br><br>      
The of her crash, she was in the *TRUCK* with her boyfriend, her friend, and her friend's boyfriend. So right there, was the *TWO BOYS.* The boys got out of the truck to get their friend Mark. So Jessica and her friend were left in the truck. Jessica thought it would be a good joke if they both took the truck, and left the boys for about 5 minutes. So, Jessica hopped up front, forgot about her seatbelt, and took off. She lost control around a turn, and hit a *CURB.* The truck flipped over and over, and my friend Jessica got flown from the windshield of the truck. She was flown to the Christiana Hospital by helicopter. Her friend was okay, because she had her seatbelt on. But..Jessica made it-only with cuts, scratches, bruises, broken bones, swelling, etc., and she was put into Acoma. Until 4 weeks later...
<br><br> 
Jessica was pronounced dead on May 18th, 2004.
<br><br>
Ouija boards may tell a lot...more than you want to think or know about.&quot;
