On March 6, 2008 I received an e-mail from Denni about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Denni and I wanted to share an Ouija board story when three of my friends and I contacted a spirit named Chuck.
<br><br>
It was February 29th at my friend Megan's house. There was me, Megan, Shelby, and Brandon. We were all at Megan's house. This was mine, Shelby's, and Brandon's first times playing with the board. It was Megan's second.
<br><br>
At first, Brandon and I were the ones who started asking the spirits questions. I called out: &quot;Are there any spirts here wishing to speak with us?&quot; The board very slowly moved to yes. I asked: &quot;Who are we speaking with?&quot; but the board didn't answer. We said goodbye and tried again later.
<br><br>
The second time, it was with Brandon and Megan on the planchette. Megan asked, &quot;Are there any spirits wishing to talk with us?&quot; The board moved to yes faster than the first time, but still very slow. Megan then asked, &quot;What is your name?&quot; and the board spelled out Chuck. &quot;How old are you?&quot; Thirteen was the board's answer. It just so happens that Brandon and Shelby are 13, and Megan and I are 12 years old. Then Megan asked &quot;Can you please give us a sign you are with us?&quot; The board didn't do anything, so we all looked around the room. (There was only a small light on) Suddenly, Brandon's cell phone rang. It was a wrong number that sounded exactly like Brandon's father, but it wasn't. We said goodbye and tried once again later.
<br><br>
The third time we used the board it was between Shelby and Brandon. Brandon spoke this time. &quot;Chuck, are you still with us?&quot; and the reply was yes. But this time the board went very fast. We asked Chuck his age again, just to make sure. He said that he was 13, and the board was still moving fast. The next question Brandon asked was &quot;Could you please give us a sign that you're with us?&quot; All was silent. Then Brandon's cell phone rang again. This time it was his father. So Brandon had to leave.
<br><br>
The last and final time we played the Ouija board that night was with myself and Megan. It was very short. We asked if any spirits were with us, but nothing happened. So we said goodbye and stopped for the night. We think the reason for the third time was that we used the board and it went so fast was because Brandon likes Shelby more than a friend. We are going to use the board again very soon.
