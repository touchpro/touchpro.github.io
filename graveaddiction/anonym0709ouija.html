On July 31, 2009 I received an e-mail from an anonymous website visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

As I said in my last story, I had three other Ouija board uses. These were all on a homemade Ouija board, and all three had the same result. Before I would ask a question, the quarter I was using would move toward either the moon, sun or the yes. After using it three times I had a very strange dream (about two days afterward) in which I was told by a priest that I was Jesus' brother. I am not Christian at all, so this was a very strange dream for me. Shortly after I had yet another dream. This dream was obviously propelled by me watching horror movies before sleeping. However, I have no fear of Hollywood's movies, or the monsters, killers, or ghosts in them. This dream had no meaning, however, it did have a strange line. At one point in the dream a person had said &quot;Call the police, tell them pigeon blood's been spilt.&quot; At first I figured he meant somebody had died. But later on I read an article online that stated the phrase &quot;Pigeon Blood&quot; refers to rubies which were obtained in a certain area. In this area people are killed for the rubies, hence the word &quot;blood.&quot; But I had never even heard the words &quot;pigeon&quot; and &quot;blood&quot; used beside each other, how could I have known this was a combination? That struck my interest. My third and final dream happened very recently. However, I cannot seem to remember what made that dream so strange. I am beginning to wonder if it is a message, or my brain is starting to think of weird sentences that stick with me for more than a week. The strangest part is that both of the sentences were spoken in the exact same voice during the dreams.
