On January 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kelly about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Me and my friends (Bria and Maria) love the ouija board and enjoy trying new things. We had previously had an experience outside that was the scariest thing I've ever come across, so around the year anniversary of that experience we wanted to try again. We didn't want to go back outside on my driveway, since last time we had to run inside.  So we sat on my front porch. About 10 minutes into the session, we couldn't take it...the last experience outside had scarred us. We moved the session inside, into my living room. It started off as usual, with asking questions and receiving answers. We started asking about my friend Bria, and the board said that something bad but important would happen to her. And just as soon as we were going to find out what it was, the power went out. I started getting a little hungry, and I decided to get up since the power came on soon after that. Bria and Maria continued using the board without me, and again the power went out.  This time Bria said she had felt something fly over her head, and she heard a growling noise. We eventually ended it because it was just getting creepy.
<br><br>
In early ouija board experiences only, I could use the board and get it to work.  Eventually I had gotten tired of being the only one, so I had to teach Bria how to get it to work. Apparently I had to lend my ouija powers to her, but now it works.  We just get different people depending on who is on the board.
<br><br>
Since I don't think my friends have heard of this website, I'll put their stories on this page too.
<br><br>
I was at a birthday party yesterday, 1/24/09.  It was my friend's sweet 16, and we got on the topic of ghosts and such. I will share their stories on here.
<br><br>
Sebastian( birthday boy/story 1): He had told me that he doesn't like playing the board after this one experience he had where him and his friends were playing in the woods. He freaked out because he heard someone whisper in his ear, &quot;I'm here watching you.&quot; He ran out, and I guess he won't play ever again.
<br><br>
Vin and Nick (story 2): They told me that nothing freaky ever happens to them, so I told them they should hang with me LOL. But anyways, they told me that a member of their family was in the Vietnam War, came home and later died in a car crash. So every once in a while at his grandparents' house, the pictures turn upside down.  His grandpa must say, &quot;Stop, Eddie,&quot; which causes all the pictures to go back to their normal position. Another story they told me was that their aunts had stolen money from their grandparents occasionally, and they were just mean and bratty people. So when one time when the aunts arrived at the grandparents house, as soon as they got out of their car it randomly burst into flames.
<br><br>
This story is last because I found it the coolest and scariest.
<br><br>
Dave (story 3): His story started out with him telling me that him and his friend Joe were in the woods, just chilling and hanging out until his mother called and said that he had to be home in 5 minutes or he couldn't go to a party the next day. He and his friend started running, until Joe just stopped out of nowhere. A tree fell right in front of Joe, barely missing him.  They said they saw a HUGE black figure jump out of the trees, land on the ground, and take off running.
<br><br>
All stories are from friends of mine and are 100% true. I encourage people to add stories to this website since it is a great website, and a way of getting your stories out there. Also, don't be afraid of the unknown, embrace it.
