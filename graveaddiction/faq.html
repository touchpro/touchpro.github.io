<br><br>
I have received several questions about the site and about me, so I have decided to take any questions that people have asked me 5+ times and post them here, along with my answers.  I've tried to keep them in order, with the most popular questions listed first.
<br>
<ol>
<li><u>Are you obsessed with death?</u><br><br>
No, not really.  I just think cemeteries contain a lot of history and beautiful artwork, that's why I explore them.  However, like most people I do find death interesting to think about.  But no, I don't obsess about it. <br><br>
<li><u>Is this website your job?</u><br><br>
I wish!  No, the website is just a hobby, something I like working on in my
spare time.  I work for a large corporation here in Columbus, in an IT/Systems area.  I'm a Senior  Analyst, and I do software testing.  Overall, it's a pretty cool job!<br><br>
<li><u>How old are you?/What is your astrological sign?</u><br><br>
I'm a 27 year old Taurus.<br><br>
<li><u>How did you get into exploring?</u><br><br>
I've always been fascinated with cemeteries and ghost related stuff.  My mom used to tell me ghost stories when I was a kid, and I loved them!  I decided to start the site in January of 2003 to share my photos and stories with other people who are interested in this stuff too.<br><br> 
<li><u>What kind of camera do you use to take the photos for the site?</u><br><br>
I have two cameras that I use:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Olympus C-770 Ultra Zoom digital camera.  It is a 4.0 megapixel and has 10x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom.
<li>Olympus Infinity Stylus 35mm camera.  My parents bought this camera for me as a Christmas present in 1991.  So yes, it's an old, simple, point-and-shoot camera, but it still works great!  And it takes very clear photos.  When I use this camera, I scan the photos using a Canon LiDE 35 scanner.
</ul>
<br><br>
<li><u>What kind of recorder do you use for EVP recordings?</u><br><br>
I have an old Sony M-427 microcassette recorder that I use occasionally, but for the most part I use my two digital voice recorders since the recordings turn out clearer:
<br><br>
<ul>  
<li>Olympus WS-200S digital voice recorder.  This recorder can store up to 54 hours and 5 minutes in the lowest recording mode...up to 8 hours and 50 minutes in the highest mode.  It records in WMA format, which I can convert to MP3 format for the site.  And I don't even have to mess around with cords, it plugs directly into the computer! 
<li>Olympus DW-90 digital voice recorder.  This recorder can store up to 90 minutes in the lowest recording mode.  I usually use the highest mode, which records a little over 22 minutes.  The nice thing about this recorder is that I can easily hook it up to the computer via USB and download the recordings in WAV format.  I can then take the WAV file and transfer it to MP3 format for the site.
</ul>
<br><br>
<li><u>What do you take with you on explorations?</u><br><br>  
Well, it really depends on where I'm going.  Here's a list of everything I might possibly take though:
<br><br>
<ul> 
<li>I ALWAYS have my digital and 35mm cameras with me...you never know when you may stumble across and old cemetery, haunted place, or abandoned building!
<li>I always carry at least 2 extra rolls of 35mm film with me. 
<li>I almost always carry an extra memory card with me for the digital camera.
<li>I almost always have the digital recorders with me.  They are really small so it's easy to carry.
<li>I have a small digital thermometer that I take with me on ghost hunts.  This comes in handy to note any cold spots that often occur when ghosts are near.
<li>If I'm going into an abandoned building or any other dark place, I always make sure to bring a flashlight.
<li>A small notebook and pen to record any unusual things I may encounter.
<li>Extra batteries.  I always take at least one backup for every battery operated thing I'm carrying.
<li>A first aid kit.  Since I'm very &quot;talented&quot; when it comes to finding things I can injure myself on/with, so I always have a first aid kit either in the car or in my backpack.
<li>A camera bag, to carry all my stuff.  And if my camera bag isn't big enough...
<li>A backpack.
<li>Pepper spray or mace, just because you never know who you may run into in an abandoned or desolate place.
<li>Water.  It's always a good idea to keep a bottle or water (or more) in the car or in your backpack.  A lot of these locations are isolated, and being thirsty isn't fun.
</ul>
<br><br>
<li><u>Do you recommend using digital cameras for ghost hunting?</u><br><br>
I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with using digital cameras for ghost hunting.  A lot of paranormal researchers are against them, however I believe that as long as a person doesn't consider every single white spot in a photo to be an orb (a lot of digitals pick up dust, etc) it's OK to use them.  
<br><br>
<li><u>You grew up in Fairfield County?  Where did you go to school?</u><br><br> 
I went to <a href="http://www.fishercatholic.org" target="_blank">William V. Fisher Catholic High School</a> in Lancaster, Ohio.  I graduated in 1997.
<br><br>
<li><u>Do you have a favorite cemetery?</u><br><br>
I honestly don't think I could pick a favorite.  I've enjoyed visiting all of the cemeteries on my site, and each one has something unique about it that makes it special.  If I <b>had</b> to pick just one, I guess I'd pick <a href="bright.html">Bright Cemetery</a> in Baltimore, Ohio.  It's one of the first cemeteries I ever explored so it holds a special place in my heart :) I have a list of my <a href="bfavcem.html">top 50 favorite cemeteries</a> listed off the main <a href="cemindex.html">cemetery</a> page.
<br><br>
<li><u>What's the scariest thing you've ever experienced on an exploration?</u><br><br>  
My scariest experience was definitely at <a href="egrave.html">Elisabeth's Grave</a> in Chillicothe, Ohio.  I experienced some strange car problems there, you can read about it on that page.  My experience at <a href="lakin.html">Lakin Hospital</a> was also pretty creepy (again, check out the page to read about it).
<br><br>
<li><u>Have you always lived in Ohio?</u><br><br>
I spent three semesters at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  But yes, the rest of my life has been spent in the Central Ohio area.
<br><br>  
<li><u>Are you affliated with any other ghosthunting organizations?</u><br><br>
Yes, I am a member of <a href="http://www.majda.net" target="_blank">MAJDA</a>, <a href="http://www.theupia.com" target="_blank">The United Paranormal Investigators Association (UPIA)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ohioevp.com" target="_blank">Ohio EVP and Paranormal Society</a>...they're all terrific groups!  
<br><br>They're not ghosthunting groups, but I'm also a member of the <a href="http://www.ohiohistory.org" target="_blank">Ohio Historical Society</a> and <a href="http://www.gravestonestudies.org" target="_blank">The Association For Gravestone Studies</a>.
<br><br>
<li><u>Do you have any other hobbies?</u><br><br>
Of course I do!  I enjoy gardening, cooking, and reading.  I also collect antique/vintage glassware and old photos (especially post mortem and funeral related ones).  I really enjoy going to flea markets, antique stores, and auctions.  I'm also an eBay addict :)
<br><br>
<li><u>Do you go to church?</u><br><br> 
I was raised Catholic, but no, I don't attend church now.  I think the label that best fits my beliefs would be secular humanist.
<br><br>
<li><u>Are you afraid you'll go to hell for believing in all this ghost stuff?</u><br><br> 
No, what's so bad about believing in ghosts anyway?  It doesn't hurt anyone/anything.
<br><br>
<li><u>Did you go to Ohio State?</u><br><br> 
No, I went to Eastern Michigan University for three semesters and DeVry for three trimesters.  I haven't finished my degree yet, but I plan to get a degree in Computer Information Systems someday.
<br><br>
<li><u>Don't you get depressed after visiting all those cemeteries?  Are you on prozac?</u><br><br> 
No to both questions!  Thinking about death doesn't depress me, and honestly, I don't even think about death when I visit cemeteries.  The only depressing moments I ever experience at cemeteries is a sadness at how vandalized some of them are.  I think vandalizing cemeteries is awful, and I don't understand why some people think it's fun.
<br><br>
<li><u>Have you ever been arrested for trespassing?</u><br><br>
No...and hopefully I never will!
<br><br>
<li><u>What tools/software do you use to make the site?</u><br><br>  
First, I don't use Frontpage...it generates too much worthless code.  I use a simple html editor called <a href="http://www.araneae.com/" target="_blank">Araneae</a>.  I highly recommend it - it's simple, but it has some cool features.  I really like the syntax highlighting that color codes my tags, the line numbers, and the color chart that I can use to find the hex code for any color.  
<br><br>
As far as FTP software, I use FTP Explorer...you can download it at <a href="http://www.ftpx.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ftpx.com</a>.  It's really easy to use, it's just like your Windows Explorer/File Manager.
<br><br>
I've also used a few other tools:
<br><br>
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://carbonize.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lazarus</a> - This is the free php script I used for my guestbook.    
<li><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">PhpBB2</a> - An awesome (free!) message board that's pretty easy to set up.   
<li><a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Drive</a> - An awesome places for free DHTML scripts.
<li><a href="http://www.hotscripts.com" target="_blank">Hot Scripts</a> - Lots and lots of free scripts (all kinds!).
<li><a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/" target="_blank">Javascript Kit</a> - Lots of free javascripts.
<li><a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a> - I use Blogger to create and post entries to the <a href="newstuff.html">updates</a> page.
<li><a href="http://www.atomz.com" target="_blank">Atomz</a> - My site's search is powered by Atomz.
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe</a> - I use Adobe Acrobat 5.0 to create documents in pdf format.
</ul>
<br><br>
<li><u>I found your site looking for frog information.  Why isn't there anything about frogs here?</u><br><br>
I used to have a frog site, www.hoppytogether.com, but I cancelled it in May 2003.  I just wasn't having fun with it anymore - mainly because too many animal rights activists were attacking me.  I still have a pet frog though.  His name is Ted, and I've had him since January 2002...here are a few pictures:
