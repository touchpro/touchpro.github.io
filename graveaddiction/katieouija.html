On August 18, 2005 I received an e-mail from Katie J. about her creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My name is Katie, I'm 23 years old and from Ohio. I read all your stories on here one day when I was off work.
<br><br>
Well, I have an ouija board story I wanted to share.  When we were moving my 88 year old grandma out of her big, old house last summer, we were going through a lot of old stuff in order to auction it all off.  We were taking things we wanted. Well, I noticed in her bedroom that she had a very old ouija board sitting there.  So I ran downstairs and asked her if I could have it, and she said &quot;I forgot I even had it, and yes you can.&quot;  So we decided that when we moved her into her new apartment we would play, and we were both excited about it because we are both into this type of stuff. I must have got it from her!
<br><br>
Well, in December she broke her wrist and had to go to therapy at a nursing home.  She was supposed to get out January 7th.  Well, they skipped a couple of her blood pressure pills and as a result she passed away January 7th.  I never got to play with her, but the other day I was on the internet looking up a prison and your website came up.  I read stories for an hour on here...okay, maybe more like four hours!  It reminded me of the board my grandma let me have...
<br><br>
So I asked a lot of my friends to play, and only my best friend who is also into stuff like this said she would play with me. So I went out and bought a sage candle, and we said a little prayer.  We sat outside on her patio and we asked if anyone was here.  It said &quot;YES&quot;.  We then asked what the name was, and it said &quot;CRUG&quot;.  We asked if it was male or female, and they put &quot;F&quot;.  Then we asked what year she died, and she spelled out 1468.  We asked how she died, and she spelled &quot;Hung&quot;.   My friend was a little freaked out, and she leaned over to me and goes &quot;ask her why she got hung&quot;.   So I did and she spelled &quot;lust&quot;.  I asked, &quot;was it worth it?&quot;, and she went to the middle of the board so I figured it was a maybe.  We asked what brought her here tonite, she put &quot;JT&quot;.  We asked who that was, she put &quot;Son&quot;.  So then we asked her if she was one of our spiritual guiders, and she put &quot;K&quot;.  Well, my name is Katie and my friend's name is Kristen.   So I asked, &quot;are you for Kristen?&quot;, and she spelled &quot;NO&quot;.  I asked &quot;for me - Katie?&quot;, and she spelled &quot;YES&quot;.  We asked how many people were with us tonite, and she spelled &quot;4&quot;.   
<br><br>
Well, it stopped all of a sudden and Kristen told me to hold on...she heard something!  She came out with her 7 month old son, and he was crying really loud.  She said he never wakes up in the middle of the night, so we said goodbye and we put the board away.  I never got to finish asking if it was really my spiritual guide or not...I wonder if something happened with her son and she was trying to get the point across or not? It just was weird that my friend's son was crying too in the middle of the night...&quot;
