<i>I looked through my prison collection and found some court/sentence papers from Lycoming County, PA.  Some of the papers were from the trial of a man named Alfred Strothers.   He was found guilty of larceny in July of 1919, and was sentenced to serve 12-18 months in Eastern State Penitentiary beginning in September 1919.  Actually, I have one of these documents scanned and posted on the <a href="esp.html">Eastern State Pen</a> page.</i>
