On September 1, 2007 I received an e-mail from Nic about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I bought a ouija board tonight, because I've never used one before. So my brother and I are using the ouija now. Please read this conversation we had with the board and tell me your thoughts on it.
<br><br>
Me:  I would like to start by saying that we only wish to talk to spirits who are of good intentions and do not wish us harm or fear. If you are a bad spirit and have bad intentions, we will close the board.
<br><br>
We warmed the board up.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone who would like to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: TDK<br>
<br>
Me: Are those initials?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 9<br>
<br>
Me: When did you pass away, TDK?<br>
Board: 29<br>
<br>
Me: Is that 1929?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
The conversation continued normally, with me and my brother asking him questions about his life, and if he likes dogs, if he had any dogs (he did have dogs, named ReRe and FeFe, which is weird because when we first used the board those 2 names came through, and when I asked him the names those were the ones he gave me) and how he died. He said he died from tuberculosis.
<br><br>
Me: What Year were you born, TDK?<br>
Board: 6<br>
<br>
Me: Is that 1906, TDK?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
This is where it gets weird. When we first talked to him he seemed friendly and answered all of our questions. But the planchette was moving rather quickly, which is unusual from my understanding. Anyways, back to the story. When I asked him what year he was born, and he said 6, I knew something was wrong. If he died when he was 9, then he would have be born in 1920....I asked him if he'd like to try again and he said yes. Again he went to 6. I told him he could try one more time, because I had a feeling I knew where this was going. Again he started going to 6. I stopped him and moved the planchette to goodbye. Also, instead of answering by moving to yes, he moved to Z. I asked if this meant yes, and he moved to yes. We decided to try again before I began this email...but now TDK won't get off the board. Also, is it wrong to ask for a spirit by name? I'd like to contact my grandfather who recently passed.
<br><br>
I asked TDK if he was an evil spirit, and he said yes. Again, I closed the board (yes, each time by moving to and saying goodbye, and turning the board over.)
<br><br>
Please tell me what you think of this...because this is my first time using a board, and I'd really hate to bring out an evil spirit or something. I won't let him countdown or go through the letters, but he hasn't tried. Also, when I asked him what TDK stood for, he spelled Ambelem and Tewem...any ideas?
<br><br>
I don't know if the Bible has anything to do with the ouija board, but after he tried to go 6-6-6 on me I went and got my Bible. I asked him if the Bible bothered him, and he said yes. So I do believe he is in fact a demon. But he lied, because we asked him if he was in heaven when we first talked to him and he said yes.  Then I asked again and he said no. So he is lying. Please help me.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Nic, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward your advice on.
