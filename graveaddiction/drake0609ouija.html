On June 6, 2009 I received an e-mail from Drake Dietrick about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Now, I know what you are thinking. I never believed in this stuff, either. I used to roll my eyes and laugh at all this stuff too...honestly...it is human nature. I just thought people were making this stuff up to scare each other. It is easy for someone who claims they saw a ghost or an alien abducted them. If you believe in God...I ask...have you ever seen him? If your answer is no...and you believe anyway...I have no problem with that. If someone BELIEVES they saw a ghost or were abducted by an alien...sure I can attribute it to a nightmare or their imagination getting the best of them. Anyone can dismiss something...pretty easily. I think people should OPEN THEIR MINDS. I mean think of it...not really that long ago, people used to laugh when someone used to say the world was round...NOT FLAT too. There are things in this world...that are simply unexplainable. The ocean is still unexplored...there are unidentified objects...even the government admits that. Now, whether they are driven by aliens is a secret...and ask yourself why. In my lifetime I have seen a few people with that pale white terrified face...after they have seen what they believed to be a ghost. Now, just because I did not see it...I never really mocked them. HOWEVER, I WANTED TO SEE AN ALIEN FOR MYSELF. I WANTED TO SEE A GHOST. I WANTED TO SEE THAT OUIJA BOARD MOVE. I WAS CURIOUS...IT IS SIMPLY HUMAN NATURE.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Way back in 1990...we were young and curious students, so we goofed around with it anyway. I must have played with a Ouija board over 20 times as a little kid and as a teenager. Nothing ever happened. Until some of my buddies and I tried to do it at my fraternity house in Bloomington, Indiana years and years later.
<br><br>
It was Halloween night. I was stone cold sober because I was studying real late for this Spanish quiz I had to take the next morning. I finished up at around 3:00 A.M. or so. As I was heading to my room on the 2nd floor, I walked by Room #201. About 10 dudes were huddled around this bar, with all of the lights out, and a candle was burning. They looked all freaked out.
<br><br>
Now when I walked into the room, they had this clear glass upside-down, and a Ouija board made up of cardboard cutouts on top of this bar they had built in there. It had numbers, letters, yes, no, entry, and exit written on the cutouts. It was laid out just like a Ouija board. I guess you would call it a homemade Ouija board. I swear to God, the glass was moving all around, answering questions. It was moving incredibly fast. That alone was unbelievable to me. So, I decided to join in.
<br><br>
We were behind the bar. There were 2 people to my left. One was Brendan W. also from Park Ridge, Illinois, and Marc T. from Portage, Indiana. We all put 2 fingers on top of the glass. First, Brendan asked this spirit what his younger brother's middle initial was. The glass immediately went to the letter 'M' on the board. For no reason, Brendan said, &quot;That's it, I quit!&quot; He quickly left the room. I later found out from Brendan that his little bro's middle name was Malcum. We were all like, &quot;Geez, take it easy.&quot;
<br><br>
We all felt compelled to play on. A guy named Timmy M. entered the room with a bible, and attempted to read it, and his eyes started to tear up!! I asked him what was wrong, and he said he didn't know. He had this baffled look on his face that I will never forget. Next, a girl attempted to enter the board with us, put her fingers on the glass, and she immediately passed right out!! I mean she went lifeless and just dropped to the floor within seconds of touching that glass!! For no reason, we kept playing with it anyway.
<br><br>
All of us asked for physical evidence of something being in the room with us. One person asked if we could have the spirit blow out the candle that was lit. Another guy told us not to do that. We asked why, and he told us that he and a friend asked a spirit to do just that, and it blew out the candle, and after the lights went out, the dude said he was bitten by something! Now honestly, that kind of scared me, but we pressed on. Then, I will never forget, the guy next to me, Marc T., grabs me and says, &quot;Drake, you believe in God don't you? Nothing's going to happen to us, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah of course I do. He'll protect us, don't worry.&quot;
<br><br>
We all placed our fingers back on the glass, and we all asked the spirit to blow out the candle. Just then, Marc T. who was now the only person to my left behind the bar, shoves me aside. Then he ran on a dead sprint straight into the closet to my right. He knocks his head right into a block wall. Boom! We stopped, and turned on the light. I swear, he was sitting on the floor of the closet, in some type of convulsion. His head was shaking around like that movie &quot;Jacob's Ladder.&quot; Marc was not just pale, but the tone of his skin was totally green! Once again, it scared the snotty out of me, and it scared everyone else too. Marc stopped shaking, and swore he was ok, but he didn't want to play anymore. So now Marc leaves the room. We played on anyway. Like idiots.
<br><br>
So, at this point, there was no one standing next to me behind the bar on my left. I was standing back there by myself, while the rest of the guys were on the other side. The next thing that happened was unreal. We put our fingers on the clear, upside-down glass, and it sparked. It actually looked like a miniature lightning bolt, inside the glass. I swear I saw it, and so did everyone else around the board. We not only saw it, but it shocked all of our fingers. We continued to ask for the candle to be blown out anyway.
<br><br>
Then all of sudden, I hear this inhuman voice. It was moaning with this weird echo to it. The voice began to get louder, and came closer to me until it sounded like it was right next to me. It was on my left side. Then out of nowhere, it actually blew in my ear. I went up against the wall with my shoulder up to my left ear. At this point, honest to God, there was no one left behind the bar to my left-hand side. I then felt something cold and evil walk from left to right, right through my body, and I totally blacked out. When I woke up, it was really freaky. Everyone was around me. They were all asking if I was alright. You should have seen their faces. All of these guys were scared out of their minds. I asked them, &quot;What happened?&quot; They said, &quot;Dude, you flew against the wall with your shoulder up against your ear.&quot; I asked, &quot;Did you guys hear that moaning?&quot; They said, &quot;No. What do you mean? What moaning?&quot; I said, &quot;That echo, that voice, moaning, it blew right in my ear.&quot;
<br><br>
They all said they didn't hear anything at all. I said, &quot;That is it. I will never, ever play with this crap again. I suggest you guys stop too, and don't provoke whatever it is. Or else, you will be next. Don't you see? It is going right down the line. I don't think you guys should be playin' with this stuff. Didn't you guys see the movie 'The Exorcist'? It is how the possession got started. All of it started from a Ouija board. I read somewhere that there were over 40 priests there...on the set of 'The Exorcist' to verify the story for director William Friedkin. They were all witnesses to the exorcism. I heard it was not a girl, but it was a boy, who is still alive today. The spirit entered him when he played around with a Ouija board.&quot;
<br><br>
Finally, we all stopped, and I never, ever messed with anything like that again. In fact, I never went back into that Room #201 ever again. Our former fraternity house is now vacant. There have always been rumors that the house is haunted. Since then, whenever it comes up, I have always told people to stay away from Ouija boards. Now I am telling you guys. A Ouija board is an entry and exit way for a demon, or the very devil himself.
<br><br>
Since that night, I just understood on my own that it would lie, answer you in puzzles, and it could enter anyone on that board. The demon may decide to stay a while. Thank the Lord it did not stay inside me. Well, to me, it just immediately removed any doubt about life after death, or the existence of angels, demons, God and Satan. But the point of this long story is this: ever since that night, whenever I see or hear anything like that night, I get a chill running through my body. It always feels just like that thing walking through me on Halloween night. I have always wondered if those guys have had the same thing happen to them.
<br><br>
There were two guys I knew that spent a Christmas break alone at a Fraternity. They both heard all of the tables and chairs being thrown around in the basement...both of them went down there, checked it out, and all of the tables and chairs were in their normal positions. Then, I spent the night there alone on a Christmas break. I had the scariest nightmare, and woke up suddenly, and got that awful chill again. Five minutes later, I hear all of the tables and chairs being thrown around in the basement of the house. I went downstairs, and there was nothing out of place. I felt a huge chill go right through me...not only that night, but every single time I speak or even think about the Ouija board in Room #201, or the noises that I heard that night.
<br><br>
If any of my fraternity brothers stumble across this site, perhaps they can verify this story. The house is now vacant. I cannot help but wonder if someone else experienced the same things we did since 1990. I used to laugh when people would tell me ghost stories, because I never saw anything...and I honestly understand why people don't believe in ghosts, UFO's, the devil, etc.  But since those two nights at IU...I believe for sure that there are forces beyond our comprehension that are NOT TO BE MESSED WITH.
<br><br>
If there are doubters and skeptics...well...if you dare...on HALOWEEN NIGHT at 3:00 AM, spend the night playing with a Ouija board...but just remember I advised you NOT to do it. I never experienced anything until we did this, and I WILL NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN. It sure made a believer out of me. I used to think the same thing...bunch of b.s., until I learned the hard way. IT DEPENDS WHEN AND WHERE YOU MESS WITH IT. That worked for us, and I never went NEAR one of those things again. I gave you the formula and conditions to see or experience something...whether you try it or not...is your choice...but I wanted to go on record by warning you NOT TO DO IT. It made me believe that there is a devil for sure...it is not a spirit. Like the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot;...the one younger priest said...&quot;now there seems to be several spirits communicating...&quot; The Exorcist interrupted him by saying &quot;THERE IS ONLY ONE.&quot; I learned that lesson the hard way. It could have stayed a while, but thank God it only lasted for a few seconds. I have never blacked out in my entire life, and I have never been more terrified. I have had about 100 nightmares about it since. Challenge or provoke this thing, and you are definitely asking for trouble. TRUST ME. For some strange reason I feel compelled to warn people, and I go out of my way to do it. Never felt like that...about anything, to be perfectly honest with you.
