On March 27, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kyle about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
It was me, my good friend Archie, our friend Ashley, and her friend Becky. We were all in the closet of Ashley's old house where the ouija board was set up, along with an odd picture of a woman who is deceased that laid on the floor staring straight at the board.  To be honest, that was quite creepy in itself.
<br><br>
We began to play, and I remember bits and pieces.  This is what I can remember happening:
<br><br>
Archie: Are there any spirits here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Ashley: What is your name?<br>
Board: Abby Walker (not quite positive on the name, but pretty sure)<br>
<br>
Ashley: Are you nice, Abby?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your religion?<br>
Board: Atheist<br>
<br>
Me: Wow, me too.<br>
<br>
Archie and Ashley began to ask if it was alright to ask how she died, and when and where. Then they began to ask the usual stuff like who am I going to marry and how many kids will I have.  This is where I did the wrong thing, and I regreted this mistake for weeks...
<br><br>
Ashley: 'achuu'<br>
Board: God Bless You<br>
<br>
Ashley: Thank you<br>
Board: Your Welcome<br>
<br>
Me: Wow, what a sad excuse for an atheist! How can you say god bless you when you don't believe in god?<br>
Board: Fuck you<br>
<br>
Ashley: Do you like everyone at this table?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Ashley: Do you like me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Archie: Do you like me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Becky: Do you like me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Archie: Do you like Kyle?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Archie: Why not?<br>
Board: Fag<br>
<br>
All of them began to crack up, except for me.
<br><br>
Me: Screw you<br>
Board: Fuck you<br>
<br>
Me: No<br>
Board: Leave now fag<br>
<br>
I was very freaked out, so I hurried out of the closet at the wishes of the ouija board.  I sat in the bathroom next to the closet with loads of paranoia, and just a being watched feeling.  Then I could hear my friends telling me I could come back in...that the spirit said I could. I was hoping I could fix the mess I had started, but it was hard to do so.
<br><br>
Me: I'm sorry Abby<br>
Board: Hate<br>
<br>
Me: Do you hate me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: I'm very sorry<br>
Board: Fag<br>
<br>
My friends and I continued talking to Abby until she decided to say goodbye.  Then we started talking to another spirit, but nothing bad happened. The next day I went home to an empty house because my parents had gone out for the night. I was terribly frightened, and I turned on all the lights.  I still had that being watched feeling though. This feeling continued on for weeks, and then it got a little worse.  I began to hear things calling out my name every once and awhile, which really freaked me out.  I am better now, but while writing this to you I started to get that feeling back.  Maybe I missed  a detail or two and the spirit wants me to know that.  Or maybe the spirit is thanking me for writing to you about this experience I had with her. Your site has been much help to me since this has happened and I've had more pleasant ouija experiences since then.
