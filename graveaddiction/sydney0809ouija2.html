On August 13, 2009 I received another e-mail from Sydney about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Okay, I just recently sent a story about a ghost named Toby, and since then, I've used it again.  But this time, just with Caroline and Bre. It started off with just me and Bre first...
<br><br>
Bre: Is anyone here?<br>
Board: 23<br>
<br>
Me: What?<br>
Board: 23. Death. 23. Death.<br>
<br>
Me: No...not 23.<br>
Bre: What's wrong with 23?<br>
Me: 23 is a bad number. Taylor usually has issues with it.<br>
Bre: What does 23 mean?<br>
Board: 23. Death. 23. Death. Tetue. 23 death<br>
<br>
(the board was moving so fast)<br>
<br>
Me: Who is this?!<br>
Board: Cee.<br>
<br>
Me: Oh, Cee, what's wrong?<br>
Board: 23. Death. 23. Death.<br>
<br>
Me: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!<br>
Board: 23. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Bre: That...was weird.<br>
<br>
(I was pretty scared, but we still tried again.)<br>
<br>
Me: Is someone here?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this someone we have encountered before?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Toby?!<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Toby, we've missed you!<br>
Board: me too.<br>
<br>
Bre: Is there anything you'd like to say to us?<br>
Board: Yes, Hi.<br>
<br>
Bre and Me: Hi Toby.<br>
Me: How've you been?<br>
Toby: Okay.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you ever find Yelena?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
(Yelena was the girl that he was in love with, but never got a chance to marry her.)<br>
<br>
Me: Toby, what was wrong with Cee earlier?<br>
Toby: Cee.<br>
<br>
Me: Yes, Cee<br>
Toby: Mad. Cee.<br>
<br>
Me: You're mad at Cee?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Bre: Why?<br>
(there was no answer, so we decided to move onto a different question)<br>
<br>
Me: Hey, Toby I'm sorry I haven't used the Ouija board in a long time.<br>
Toby: Its okay.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you understand why?<br>
Toby: Yes, you're scared. Don't be scared.<br>
<br>
Me: I'm not scared now. I just don't want to use it alone.<br>
Toby: I know. It's okay.<br>
<br>
Bre: Do you want us to go get Caroline?<br>
Toby: Yes, please.<br>
<br>
Me: Nice manners. Okay we'll be right back.<br>
Toby: Okay. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
We said goodbye, and went to go get Caroline. She didn't want to use it, but we convinced her saying that Toby wanted her. She sat down next to me and we said a prayer. When the three of us put our hands on the Ouija board, it was really strong and it moved even faster.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you still here, Toby?<br>
Toby: Yes, you're back.<br>
<br>
Me: haha, yes we are. Caroline's here too.<br>
Toby: I know.<br>
<br>
Caroline: Hi, Toby...<br>
(she was really scared)<br>
<br>
Caroline: Is there anything you'd like to say to me?<br>
Toby: Hi<br>
(we all had to laugh at that)<br>
<br>
Me: Hey, Toby?<br>
Toby: what<br>
<br>
Me: Who's body are you in now?<br>
Toby: JB still.<br>
<br>
Me: Can you spell out the name, please?<br>
Toby: Jon B***** (I'm not gonna write his last name)<br>
<br>
Me: Jon never asked me to the dance like you said he would.<br>
(I forgot to mention in the last story that he said that this kid Jon, who's body Toby is currently in, would ask me to the dance)<br>
Toby: I know.<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Toby: Cee<br>
<br>
Me: What did Cee have to do with this?<br>
Toby: CEE.<br>
<br>
Me: Is it just because she's Cee?<br>
Toby: LOL yes.<br>
<br>
Caroline: Did you just say LOL?!<br>
Toby: LOL yes.<br>
<br>
Me: haha, you're awesome.<br>
Toby: Im cool.<br>
(Toby was in a really good mood, and was joking around with us. Though some things about the future he told us were a little freaky.)<br>
<br>
Me: Toby, do you like the Jonas Brothers?<br>
(Caroline and Bre both hit my shoulders.)<br>
Me: OW! I'm just wondering!<br>
Toby: LOL yes. Songs.<br>
<br>
Me: HAH! SEE?!<br>
Toby: LOL<br>
<br>
Me: What's your favorite song by them?<br>
Toby: Sorry<br>
<br>
Me: I like that song too!!<br>
(I was very excited over the fact that he liked my favorite band :P)<br>
Toby: I know.<br>
Toby: 23<br>
<br>
Me: No..don't start that again. Is this still Toby?<br>
Toby: Yes, of course.<br>
<br>
Me: Does 23 mean death?<br>
Toby: yes.<br>
<br>
Bre: Death to who?<br>
(no answer.)<br>
<br>
After that, we decided that we'd like to find out other people's futures.  Keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Jonas Brothers fan, and I asked quite a few questions reguarding them, considering what he was saying.<br>
<br>
Me: So, will I marry a Jonas Brother?<br>
Toby: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Why? I thought you liked them?<br>
Toby: bad.<br>
<br>
Me: WHAT?!<br>
Bre: They're bad?<br>
Toby: yes.<br>
<br>
Bre: You mean they have bad spirits in them?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Thats terrible! But they aren't evil, right?<br>
Toby: Just spirits.<br>
<br>
Me: So can I marry one? PLEASE?!<br>
Toby: sure.<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you.<br>
Toby: you're welcome.<br>
<br>
Here's where it got interesting...<br>
<br>
Caroline: Hey, Toby if we ask for any spirit, will they come and talk to us?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to the Jonas Brothers grandmother, please?<br>
(I was very excited :P)<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this the Jonas Brothers Grandmother?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Hi! I love your grandsons!<br>
Board: Haha<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: Cynthia<br>
<br>
Me: That's a pretty name.<br>
Board: thank you.<br>
<br>
Me: Is it okay if I marry one of the boys?<br>
Cynthia: No.<br>
<br>
Bre: What about me?<br>
Cynthia: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: WHAT?!<br>
Cynthia: Sydney, too.<br>
<br>
Me: But you just said no...<br>
Cynthia: I was JK.<br>
<br>
Me: Oh. Teehee. Which one is best for me?<br>
Cynthia: Nick.<br>
<br>
Me: YAY!<br>
Me: If you could use one word to describe Miley Cyrus what would it be?<br>
Cynthia: SLUT.<br>
<br>
Me: I agree.<br>
Bre: How will Nick die?<br>
Me: NO! DON'T ASK THAT!!<br>
Cynthia: shooting.<br>
<br>
Me: WHO WILL SHOOT HIM?!<br>
Cynthia: Miley.<br>
<br>
Me: WHAT?! WHY?!<br>
Cynthia: Break up.<br>
<br>
Me: When are they getting back together?<br>
Cynthia: One week.<br>
<br>
Me: ahhhh...<br>
Cynthia: Joe will die of cancer.<br>
<br>
Me: That's terrible!<br>
Cynthia: He'll go crazy too.<br>
<br>
Caroline: Oh my God...<br>
<br>
I was beyond scared, not just because of what we were doing...we had just found out that Miley Cyrus was gonna shoot Nick Jonas...and that Joe Jonas was gonna die of cancer, and he was gonna go crazy.<br>
<br>
We decided to try and talk to someone else..I was shocked that it actually worked (:<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to Michael Jackson?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: IS THIS MICHAEL JACKSON?!<br>
Michael: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Oh my goodness! I'm a huge fan!<br>
Michael: haha.<br>
<br>
Bre: Did you see us dancing to Thrillar earlier?<br>
Michael: Yes haha.<br>
<br>
Me: Weren't we awesome?<br>
Michael: No<br>
<br>
Me: Pssh! Well then!<br>
Caroline: Did you hear what your daughter said at your funeral?<br>
Michael: No. Yards away.<br>
<br>
Me: Oh I'm sorry..<br>
Caroline: Well, she said that you were the best dad in the world.<br>
Michael: Im crying now.<br>
<br>
Me: Im sorry, we didn't mean to make you cry...is it okay if we talk to Toby again?<br>
Michael: Its okay and Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Okay, you were a legand, Michael, and don't ever forget that.<br>
Michael: I know. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
We started to talk to Toby again. I ended up asking him where I should keep the Ouija board when I'm not using it. He told me, &quot;Bed&quot; and I was very confused.<br>
<br>
Me: Under my bed?<br>
Toby: No.<br>
<br>
Me: In my bed?<br>
Toby: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Well, Toby, I don't think I can do that. You see, I'm kind of a rough sleeper and I'd roll on you and crush you.<br>
Toby (after a few seconds): Oh..umm..okay.<br>
<br>
We talked to him for at least another hour.  I'm sorry I don't remember the conversations we had. All I remember is that in that time, I was called a retard a lot :P And he touched my arm.  We also found out that Toby can read minds as well.<br>
<br>
Caroline: All right, so what's my favorite Jonas Brothers song?<br>
(During this time, I was thinking of the song &quot;BBGood.&quot; As Caroline was waiting for her answer, that song was running through my head.)<br>
Toby: BBGood.<br>
<br>
Caroline and Bre: Wait, what?<br>
Me: Toby, did you just read my mind?!<br>
Toby: Hell Yeah!<br>
v
Caroline: Woah!!<br>
Me: Alright let's test this...what poster am I looking at?<br>
Toby: Your favorite.<br>
<br>
Me: Which is?<br>
Toby: Orange Jacket.<br>
<br>
Me: OH MY GOD!<br>
<br>
Then all of a sudden, the board started spelling out &quot;Death 23 death 23&quot; again. When we asked if it was Toby, the board said no. And that it was Cee. I had no idea why I was suddenly scared, but I was.  Then she started counting backwards, first the numbers, and she was working on the alphabet. Caroline and I had read that when a spirit does that, it means they are trying to escape.  We started to go towards goodbye, but there was some type of force trying to keep us from doing so. We managed to do it anyway.
<br><br>
Ever since we stopped her, there have been instances where I've been getting unexplainable pains that I had never gotten before. For example, in the crease of my arm, it felt like someone was grabbing hold of me, and that was the only cold spot on my arm. When it finally stopped, there were hand marks there...but no one, not even myself, had touched me.
<br><br>
Personally, I think Cee is out to get me since I stopped her from escaping the board. But Toby promised me that he wouldn't let anything happen to me, and I trust him.
<br><br>
So that's my second Ouija board expirence. Haha, and I'm glad I got to talk to both Toby and even Michael Jackson (:
