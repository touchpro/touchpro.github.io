BALTIMORE, Ohio -- Modern-day soldiers fighting in the Iraqi desert weren't far from the thoughts of men with muzzleloaders reliving wartime events of 142 years ago in a damp field yesterday.
<br><br>
&quot;It does seem strange,&quot; said Springfield resident Jim Ruley, 43, who carried a saber as a captain with the 30th Ohio.  &quot;We're staging this for fun when other people are doing this with deadly earnestness.&quot;
<br><br>
About 100 Civil War re-enactors gathered during the weekend to bring to life the April 1861 muster of the 17th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment.   
<br><br>
The past, in some ways, was present.
<br><br>
&quot;We went through the same thing in 1861 - loved ones were going to war and you didn't know if they were coming back,&quot; said Greg Forquer, 40, a real-estate appraiser from Lancaster and a corporal with the 1st Ohio Light Artillery.
<br><br>
Several re-enactors with military reserve units and the Ohio National Guard have been called to duty in Iraq, Forquer said.
<br><br>
&quot;We miss them and want them back safe, just like their families.&quot;
<br><br>
So as they staged drills and slept in tents reminiscent of Camp Anderson near Lancaster, the re-enactors remained mindful of today's war.
<br><br>
Ruley, an aeronautical engineer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, said high-tech warfare and superior training have kept down the number of U.S. troop fatalities.
<br><br>
&quot;In two weeks, we've overrun Iraq with less than 100 combat deaths,&quot; he said.  &quot;Back during the Civil War, it was not unusual to have thousands killed in a single battle in a single day.&quot;
<br><br>
Ohio supplied more than 313,000 troops to the Union during the Civil War, with about 30,000 killed.  Three Ohioans have been killed in Iraq.  Their sacrifice was honored by the &quot;troops&quot; with a moment of silence.
<br><br>
Don Pontious, 54, of Columbus, a private with 1st Ohio Light Artillery, said the encampment provided a chance to &quot;portray war so people understand what we've gone through in the past.&quot;
<br><br>
The re-enactors said it would have been a surrender of sorts to cancel the muster.
<br><br>
&quot;The terrorists and so forth would like us to hole up and stop doing everything, stop living our lives, but that's why our soldiers are in Iraq,&quot; said Carlisle resident Don Dawson, 64, who played a surgeon at a field hospital - replete with a bucket containing amputated &quot;limbs&quot;.
<br><br>
Forquer, once an Army artillery man in real life, agreed.
<br><br>
&quot;If we had canceled, it would really demoralize our guys over there.  They don't want the lifestyle to change back home; that's one of the reasons they're out there.&quot;
<br><br>
In a re-creation of the Lancaster Soldiers' Aid Society - which sold homemade items to assist Union soldiers' families - a baked goods auction raised more than $500 for military relief groups.
<br><br>
The encampment at <a href="smeck.html">Smeck Park</a> in Fairfield County, south of Baltimore, appeared authentic - except for one thing.
<br><br>
A sign hanging in front of four portable toilets dubbed the area the &quot;French Embassy,&quot; apparently a commentary on France's opposition to the Iraq war.
