On December 8, 2008 I received an e-mail from Emily about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>


My name is Emily, and this is my ouija board story. This happened back in August 2008, but I just recently found your site and I decided to share my story. It was about 6:00 PM and I was with my best friend Sierra, Angelina, and Katlyn. Angelina was the only one with ouija experience, so she started asking the questions. It started off very slow, and it took a good ten minutes to contact a spirit everytime. We decided that since my house is very old and creepy, we would ask for a spirit that died in my house. We got an answer very quickly.
<br><br>
Her name was Sara. She informed us that she was bad. She had black hair and was pale. She told us that she wasn't pretty, and that she killed. We asked her how old she was, and she told us she was 12. We began asking her questions such as &quot;how did you die?&quot; and &quot;what is your last name?&quot; She refused to answer our questions. We finally asked if she was still there, and she began to spell out &quot;be careful. I'm dangerous.&quot;  We told her goodbye, but she kept moving it away and spelling out &quot;I'm watching&quot; over and over again. Finally she agreed to say goodbye. All of us, a little freaked out, decided to take a break. We got something to eat and then soon returned to the ouija board.
<br><br>
We contacted a good spirit named Abby. She informed us that she was 12 years old and died in my house. We asked her if she knew Sara, and she said yes...she was her twin sister. We asked Abby how she died, and she told us that Sara killed her by pushing her down the stairs. We asked why she killed her, and Abby said it was because she was jealous of her because she was prettier and more popular. We asked her where she was, and she told us she was in heaven. We asked her where Sara was, and she said &quot;there.&quot;  We were confused by her answer and asked her to explain. She told us that Sara was with us. We asked why she was here with us, and she said because we let her go. We asked how, and she said &quot;Emily (me) let go.&quot; I remembered my finger slipped off, but I didn't really think anything of it. Before we could say anything, Abby said &quot;she's behind you.&quot;  We asked who, and she said &quot;Emily.&quot;  We asked Abby if Sara was mad that she was talking to us, and she said yes. Before we could say anything else, she moved it to &quot;goodbye.&quot;
<br><br>
Ever since then very strange things have been happening to me, such as: I was home alone and I walked downstairs into my living room to find that all of the pillows from my couch were stacked perfectly on top of each other in the middle of the room. As soon as I got close to them, they all tumbled to the ground. The next day I was home alone again, sitting in my room, and my bedroom door flung open and then slammed shut. I was really freaked out, so I called Sierra to come over. We were sitting on my porch, and I noticed that there was a voice recording on my phone titled &quot;SARA.&quot; I told Sierra right away, and we listened to it. It was only 3 seconds long, and it sounded like a little girl humming. We were freaked out, and Sierra yelled &quot;Stupid bitch Sara, leave us alone!&quot;  As soon as she said that, the light on my porch flickered and then turned off, and the jets in my hot tub shot on. We started to scream, and then I yelled my apologies to Sara. A few moments later, my phone's ringer was up all the way and the recording we discovered minutes earlier was set as my ringtone. Strange things like that have been happening ever since, but I have grown used to them. Now being without the often visits from Sara would feel strange.
