On February 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jess P. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I came across your site when I was looking up information about the Ouija Board, after playing and having the most amazing experience. While researching, I found that it was &quot;unlikely that you would get to talk to someone you wish to.&quot; I disagree.
<br><br>
My friend and I were talking about her father one day while sitting in her room. Her dad passed away 13 years ago. She has tried many times before to contact her father through the Ouija board, and didn't make contact until 8 years after he passed. And she didn't even make the contact with him, she just got on the board and asked if anyone was there, and her father responded. He came to her in a time in her life when she really needed it. She was into drugs and was a risk and had no idea. Her father told her to stop doing drugs, you're pregnant, and kept saying &quot;stop drugs.&quot;  He also told her she was having a boy. That day she took a test, and she was pregnant. Later she found out she was having a boy.
<br><br>
Her family is very spiritual; she was introduced to the Ouija board at 10 years old by her grandmother. She has been able to contact other members of her family while playing with her grandmother and mother. She has also had her grandmother appear for her because she knew that her mother wouldn't be able to handle it.
<br><br>
She also has something that runs through her, her grandmother and mother, and it's called the knocks.  It's when you hear a knock on the door, and nobody is really there.  When they knock 3 times, it means that someone close to you or in your family is going to pass, and it happens within a two weeks span.
<br><br>
About 3 weeks from now, 2/11/09, my friend's daughter comes out into the room and yells at us to come in, because she heard a knock at the door. We told her that nobody knocked on the door, and she said, &quot;yes they did, I heard them.&quot;  Then her mother asks how many times they knocked, and she goes, &quot;I don't know. One, Two...Three.&quot; (She's only 9 years old, and her mother hasn't told her about the knocks yet.)
<br><br>
My friend then told me that her great grandmother was going into the hospital in 2 weeks for surgery, and they don't think she's going to make it.
<br><br>
Yesterday they attended her great grandmothers funeral.
<br><br>
The day before is the night we decided that we wanted to play Ouija board. Seeing how we were talking about her father that day, we were hoping that maybe we could talk to him. Sure enough, we got to speak to him...not only once, but two separate times after talking with two other people that I know.
<br><br>
When we first got on the board we asked: Is anyone here, and they replied yes.
<br><br>
We asked what his name was, and then he replied: Dad, and wrote out his name, Lawrence. My friend's father.
<br><br>
She asked him how he thought she was doing, and he replied: stop doing drugs.
<br><br>
She said: Dad, I'm going to be ok.
<br><br>
He says: no, not if you don't stop. And I said to her: he's right, you're not going to be okay.  I started crying.
<br><br>
My friend was kind of having a hard time making out what he was saying at first.  It was a little rocky, but I felt like I knew what he was saying.  My body was heavy, and it seemed like he was communicating through me. I could understand what he was trying to spell out, and when I said it out loud he would go to yes and agree with me.  And when I was crying, he spelt out cry on the board, because he knew I was crying from what he was saying to my friend. We told him we had to go, and that we would be back on later to talk to him. My friend says she knows her dad is always watching her. He wants her to stop doing drugs. Two days before we played on the Ouija board, we noticed that the AA book was taken out of the bookcase. We asked everyone at the house if they took out the AA book, and they said no. So she had a feeling that her dad took out the AA book.
<br><br>
Later on, we went back on the Ouija board and talked to her father again. We asked him about the AA book, and he told her she needed to read it and that he took it off the shelf.
<br><br>
We asked him what he did today. Said he drew a picture. And we asked of who, and he said his daughter. She asked what she was doing in the picture. And he said reading (earlier that day she was reading a book and doing a homework sheet on it).  He started to spell out the name of the book, and said questions. For the questions she was doing on the book.
<br><br>
Her dad was a teacher, and he loved to read. So it made sense that he would draw a picture of her reading.
<br><br>
I said to my friend before playing: hey, maybe we can talk to your dad. Seeing how you have a good connection when you talk to him. And sure enough, we got to talk to her father.
<br><br>
That day, my great uncle passed away and it made me think of my grandfather. I said something to my friend about it, and I was hoping maybe we could talk to him. I never told her what I use to call my grandfather (Papa), and when we got on the board we asked if anyone was there.  It quickly it replied yes. We asked who, and he quickly spelt out Papa. I was shocked. I didn't know what to think when it spelled his name out.  So I told him that I missed him. He then spelled out: Misses you too (my grandmother always says misses you too, whenever I say I miss you, so it made me believe that it was him).  We talked for just a minute. I asked if my uncle was with him, and he went to 'C' and said yes. I know that C stood for my uncle Charles' name.
<br><br>
We decided to try and talk to somebody else after my grandfather left.
<br><br>
We asked if anyone would like to speak to us. It replied yes. We asked who. And he spelt out Calvin.
<br><br>
Last year my friend Calvin passed away.
<br><br>
I was so excited to be able to talk to him. I said what's up, and he goes &quot;chilling with dad, dad says hi.&quot;  Aat this point it had just clicked in my head that his father passed away shortly after him. I asked him a couple questions. I asked him if he knew that our school was doing a senior class dinner for him. He replied yes, and spelled out skateboard.
<br><br>
The money that we raise at the dinner is being donated to a skate park in his honor. I asked him if he was still skateboarding, and he said yes and went to SB.  I'm guessing that stands for skateboard.
<br><br>
This was one of the most amazing experiences ever. I would never have thought that this was possible. My friend who I was playing Ouija board with had no idea about my friend Calvin. It all just seemed so real.
