On March 11, 2007 I received an e-mail from Ketrino with some thoughts about the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
Ouija boards. We all have different views of them, from harmless to fun to an evil device. They obviously are something &quot;supernatural.&quot; There has been much debate over this seemly harmless toy. But is it really just a &quot;toy?&quot;
<br><br>
From my experience, Ouija is not something that should just be messed around with. Bad things can happen if you don't know what you are doing. It takes a certain kind of person to use the Ouija, mainly someone who is mentally sane and capable of handling the effects of a Ouija board. Children should never be allowed to use the Ouija. Selling them in toy stores is absolutely insane...it is not a toy. It is a serious tool used to contact the dead. But apparently some people don't understand this, and then they use it they end up having a very negative experience. Ouija is not for the faint of heart.
<br><br>
I have had a lot of experience with the Ouija. I have encountered my fair share of dark entities. They have never posed a threat directly to me, but I have a quality in me that seems to make evil not want to mess around with me. I have also had many great experiences with the Ouija as well. I have contacted my spirit guide through it and I have learned many things by using it. I have used the Ouija for years and I know that although it can become a potentially dangerous thing, it can also be a very fun &quot;game.&quot;
<br><br>
I have found that making a Ouija board is seemingly more dangerous than just going out and buying one from a toy store. I made one with my cousin Cassie when I was 13 or 14. I simply cut out letters, numbers and yes and no and placed them in a circle on the coffee table in the living room. Cassie found a glass to use and away we went. The majority of the time we had fun. I must admit I did get addicted to it while I was with Cassie. Many times we were contacted by good spirits, like my spirit guide and Cassie's father. Later on through the several nights we used the makeshift board, we were contacted by some dark entities. Most often did no harm, but just went on telling us how it was evil. There was one &quot;demon&quot; who did some scary things.
<br><br>
When we asked him for a name, he simply said 6Y0, which I just made in Syo (or something like that). I felt a heavy weight on my right shoulder briefly while we talked. He said that it was him doing that. Cassie's cat was sitting on the couch asleep. When I looked over to her, it looked like there was something pushed on her rump. This made her get up and meow in irritation. Her body moved as if someone was pushing her. After that, we heard something in the kitchen fall. We went in there and saw one of Cassie's kittens sitting on top of the microwave and there was a ceramic dish on the floor. There was no way the kitten could have knocked the dish down, let alone get on the microwave. Eventually, Syo left and didn't bother us after that.
<br><br>
I am a favorite &quot;toy&quot; of the spirits I happen to contact as well. While with Cassie, she said she saw my hair rise and fall as if someone was playing with it. As I have mentioned before, there was the time when Syo was pressuring my shoulder. We contacted a spirit who said she was a witch as well. She was the one was supposedly playing with my hair. While we talked with her, I found an irritating piece of blonde hair by my mouth. No one in Cassie's house had blonde hair. The witch said it was hers (lovely). We kept it, but Cassie's mother threw out the paper we had taped the hair to.
<br><br>
There are also spirits who tend to stick to people and a certain board. My friend Amanda and I are usually contacted by a spirit who called himself Inke. Inke never really harassed us in any way, buts imply just went on saying silly stuff and constantly telling Amanda that she was hot. He sometimes won't let us speak to other people. He is what some would call a &quot;board hog.&quot;
<br><br>
Some people may find joy in Ouija by contacting their spirit guides. This can definitely be a great experience. They are comforting and will tell you many things. But if you happen to get a spirit guide who likes to play around (such as mine), you may need to set them straight like a parent would to a child. I have also been contacted by my (guardian) angels, as has Amanda. I happen to have quite a few: Wan, (and the following have names of people I like, including TV characters. How silly) Amanda, Marik and Bakura. They were wonderful to chat with as well, but they unfortunately seem to be weaker than other spirits because they can get &quot;pushed away&quot; form the board when others want to talk.
<br><br>
I would never recommend making the spirits you contact angry. I have been lucky because they simply go to &quot;goodbye&quot; and leave. Oftentimes they don't even try to mess with me. I also tend to make spirits upset for one reason or anther, mainly because some act &quot;stupid&quot; in my presence. There has never been any real horrible things happening with an upset sprit, but there are plenty of things that may happen, including a planchette that may fly off the broad and break something.
<br><br>
Asking the spirits to show their presence, such as by making things or similar things can be both fun and dangerous. Of course, many things associated with the board can be considered dangerous. The majority of things that have happened to me when I have asked a spirit to &quot;show themselves&quot; include things moving or a chill coming across the room. There have been stories of spirits being physical when people ask for something, but I have never had that situation happen to me.
<br><br>
Using the board alone is never something I could ever do well. However, Amanda is successful with it. There is a higher potential for the board to be more dangerous when working with it alone, especially if it is just you and the board and no one else with you. I can't say a spirit would actually possess you, because I have never really believed in that too much.
<br><br>
As for safety around the board, some recommend saying prayers or something similar...I have never done that. I personally have little trouble with spirits. I always seem to overpower the evil ones for some odd reason. But for those normal people out there, do whatever you think is necessary to protect yourself from what may come during a Ouija session. Some seem to believe that a &quot;creepy&quot; setting will do wonders for their experience, but I have found that the setting doesn't matter. I have used the board in the dark, with candles, with the lights on and even out in broad daylight with the bright sun shining down.
<br><br>
In all, whilst the Ouija is a fun experience, it can be dangerous as well. It is not something to fool around with. You may encounter a dark entity, you may not. What happens when you use the Ouija is truly up to you. If you seek evil, it will come and if you seek good it will be there. Just remember to keep your cool and if you ever feel uncomfortable, stop using the board! But if you continue using the Ouija board, you will gain knowledge about it and hopefully some wonderful stories to share.
