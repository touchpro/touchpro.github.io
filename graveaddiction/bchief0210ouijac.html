On February 23, 2010 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I got this story from a person I met on the net.  It's a good one, so here goes..
<br><br>
I've done countless hours of ouija research, just because it fascinated me and I wanted to know everything I could about it.  You only talk to &quot;evil spirits&quot; through ouija boards or &quot;talking boards,&quot; whichever you prefer. The good spirits have crossed over into whatever is out there. However, some stay here because of several reasons like unfinished business, looking after a possession, a house, or an object.  Some are just pure evil spirits.  Personally, I have never come in contact with a demon to my knowledge. That would be very bad.  When you open a session, that spirit is with you. Some believe that they are beside you pushing the planchette with you, that's how it moves. Others believe that it possesses you and uses your body and energies as a way to move the planchette.  I believe it's the latter.
<br><br>
I've talked to a guy who was 41 and claimed to have died on the Titanic. He gave me the dates and everything.  I did this session with my step-sister, who didn't know the dates, and neither did I for that matter.   I looked it up when I was finished, and the information he gave me was correct!  Another instance, one of my friends, Ted, died in a drowning accident before his senior year.  The spirit said it was him, described his death, his funeral services, and everything.  He said that he was on my bed.  He also said that he was in heaven.  In this case, I do not think it was Ted.  I think it was an evil spirit lying to me.  Spirits can do that.  You never want to ask about the existence of heaven or hell, or God. I don't know why, but I've never done it.  Countless sources have advised not to.
<br><br>
With my first board, I kept on getting the same spirit who said his name was &quot;D,&quot; and I could never get him to tell me too much more than that. I took it over to my dad's house, and my step-sister was making it say things, messing with the guy. I think it pissed the spirit off.  We then foolishly took it to the local cemetery.  To my surprise, it worked.  Same guy.   He said that he was on the hood of my car. He also said that he didn't trust us.  He said that he would not harm us, but advised us to leave and we did, at very high speeds.  I did it by myself shortly after that, and the spirit was trying to move the planchette off the board, claiming to want to show me something.  I insisted that it stay on the board and spell it out. I then got frustrated when it didn't, and I said goodbye. Later that night, my hand began to move on its own while I was trying to sleep.
<br><br>
I didn't use the board for a while after that.  Later on, my grandmother wanted to use it because she didn't believe that it would work.  Within a couple of minutes the planchette began to move backwards through the numbers and alphabet, a sign that the spirit is trying to escape and that could be a very bad thing.  Sad to say, I haven't done many more ouija sessions after that last experience.
