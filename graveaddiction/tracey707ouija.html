On July 22, 2007 I received an e-mail from Tracey about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Tracey, and a few weeks ago I was attending a friend's birthday sleepover.  There were about 7 other girls with me. It was between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, and one of the girls brought an ouija board that she had just purchased.
<br><br>
The first session started out slow, and we only got our first answer after 15 minutes. When asked what the spirit's name was, it stated that it was Trevor. We asked for its age and it said it was 7. Our conversation with Trevor went on for another ten minutes, and we learned that he lived in the area and he said he was born in 1309.
<br><br>
Then we asked if it had a message for any of us. It said yes. When we asked who it was for, it said that it was for Andrea (I'm not using real names for the sake of the people involved).
<br><br>
&quot;What is your message?&quot; Andrea asked in a rather shaky voice.
<br><br>
&quot;Shut Your Door,&quot; it replied.
<br><br>
We asked Andrea if she had any problems with a door, and she said the other night she had forgotten to close the door to the balcony of her room.
<br><br>
We were freaked out but we pressed on.
<br><br>
We asked if it had any more messages and if it did, for whom?
<br><br>
It said it had a message for Emily.
<br><br>
&quot;What's your message?&quot; Emily asked.
<br><br>
&quot;Beware,&quot; the spirit replied.
<br><br>
&quot;Of what?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Brandon.&quot;
<br><br>
Right after it had spelled out &quot;Brandon,&quot; Belle, another friend who was just observing, accidentally switched on the radio with her toe and music came blasting very loudly. Of course we all screamed and almost wet ourselves, and we decided to end the session.
<br><br>
The second session started much faster than the previous one and we were talking to a spirit named &quot;Casy.&quot; Casy said she was 34. This is how our conversation went:
<br><br>
&quot;Do you have a message for one of us and if so, who?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Tracey (Me),&quot; it replied.
<br><br>
&quot;What's your message for me?&quot; I asked, immediately feeling ill once it spelled my name.
<br><br>
&quot;Careful.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Careful of what? What should I be careful of?&quot; I asked nervously.
<br><br>
It then began to spell out my uncle's name.
<br><br>
&quot;Do you know why I should be careful of him?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;No.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Ok, well we should go now. Goodbye&quot; I said. If I had done anymore we would have been cleaning the carpet for a long time.
<br><br>
I know after using an ouija board people go, &quot;I AM NEVER GOING TO USE ONE EVER AGAIN!&quot; but I am intrigued by it and am actually going to use it again tomorrow at another sleepover.
<br><br>
Wish me luck.
