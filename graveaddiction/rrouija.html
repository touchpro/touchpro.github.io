On December 2, 2005 I received an e-mail from Ricardo Rodriguez about his interesting ouija board experience, along with some background information:
<br><br><br>
It happened about a year ago.  I didn't like to go with my family anywhere because they would always take so long.  Most of the time I would stay home.  I remember a couple of things that happened to me like...
<br><br>
My family went out, and I just finished coming out of the shower when I heard someone call out my name. I asked &quot;What,&quot; but I got no response.  So I look out the window, and there was no one in sight for miles.  And I was the only one home.  Sometimes when I would take a shower it would seem as though somone was passing by and was trying to open the door by gripping the door knob, but not opening the door.  Also, sometimes the bathroom would become cold...and I don't mean just cold, I mean ICE cold for no reason.
<br><br>
When the computer used to be upstairs (now it is not), I used to hear someone walking up the stairs.  I would stop playing and look to see who it was...but it was no one.  Then the question is what was coming up the stairs if no one was there?  When I was watching T.V. one time alone in the dark, I had the remote by the lamp on the other side of the couch.  The T.V. just shut off without me touching the remote!  The one that really freaks me out was when I was searching for my paintball gun that my dad hid from me.  He didn't tell where it was for awhile.  So I started to look for it.  I was looking in the downstairs living room because he has a closet there, and behind that we have a door to the crawlspace.  Now I was going through the closet when halfway through I heard a loud thud...almost as if something was trying to get out of the crawlspace.  I got freaked out and left.
<br><br>
I was still freaked out from what happened, so I called my friend and told him to bring his ouija board.  It was ok, not as bad as I thought it would be.  We used it in the garage.  The thing is, every question either of us asked, I always saw the anwser in my mind before it was spelled it out.  Almost as if me and the board were one.  Even though I only did it for a few minutes (my experience lasted 30 minutes total because my friend went first and I joined in halfway through), all the freaky stuff stopped which is good.
