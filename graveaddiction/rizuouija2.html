On April 20, 2007 I received an e-mail from Rizu about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
As you know, the day before, April 19, my friends and I came into contact with two spirits at school, Naomi and Paige, through the ouija board. I brought the board back to school today so we could try to talk to Paige. During a class, I told one of the girls who had been watching the board with us to tell another to get some salt packages in snack mod, so we
could make a protection circle (even though we never used it). Later on, after one of my classes, I went back to the art room to meet Rachel and Lauren so we could try the board again. They had already had free periods before me, so they had gone and made their own board out of cardboard, and used a planchette from another ouija board. Rachel told me that they had been talking to Paige in the dark room. I don't remember what they had talked about with her, but it was normal. We went into the dark room and started talking with Paige again. I asked if Naomi wanted to hurt anyone. And Paige said, &quot;Yes.&quot; We asked who, and the planchette moved to &quot;LAWN.&quot; We asked if she meant Lauren, and Paige told us yes. We asked another question, which I don't remember, but as Paige started to answer, the board started going back to the ZNMA pattern of Naomi's. We asked if Naomi had tried to take over the board, and Paige said yes. I flipped the planchette over, and said goodbye, after telling Paige we would try to talk to her soon.
<br><br>
We then decided to set up my board in the closet. I asked if anyone was there, and almost immediately got a response of &quot;yes.&quot; It didn't take long to figure out we were talking to Naomi. I then flipped the planchette and went to goodbye. I have a feeling Naomi has partially taken over my board, because she won't let anyone else talk for too long. We managed to talk to Paige for a few moments, but then Naomi took over. Again, I said goodbye, and told Rachel and Lauren I wanted to use their homemade board.
<br><br>
The three of us placed the board on the stool we used as a table. I was trying to work on chemistry, so the two decided to use it while I kind of watched. However, it didn't work when it was just the two of them. It had worked earlier however. So I decided to put my fingers on the planchette as well. I was sitting on the floor, so I couldn't see what letters the
planchette was pointing to. We were finally able to talk to Paige again. I don't remember everything we asked, or even what Paige said. However, we did ask if Naomi could hurt Lauren physically, and she said no. We asked if she could mentally, and the planchette moved to yes. We asked why Naomi wanted to hurt Lauren and it went to &quot;bad.&quot; Lauren had insulted Naomi several times, despite the warnings Rachel and I gave her to stop doing so. The three of us decided to ask if there was a way to help Lauren, and then the planchette moved to &quot;Let oz out.&quot; I asked if she meant &quot;Let us out.&quot; And she said yes. We didn't have time to ask what to let them out of, because we had to go to class. So we said goodbye to Paige, and hid the homemade board.
<br><br>
I've decided to not bring my board back to school, because I don't like the thought of only being able to talk to Naomi with it. As Rachel and I were contemplating what &quot;Let us out,&quot; meant, I thought that perhaps Paige and Naomi were trapped at the school or something similar. And I feel that Naomi has gone bad because she's mad about it. Paige seems to be more patient, since she's a kind of slow responder when we talk to her. We will probably try to talk to them again, but I'm not sure. There's only three weeks left until we graduate, so we don't know if we should try to continue communication since we are going to leave.
