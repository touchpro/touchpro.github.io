Flemming Petersen sent me the following information about this abandoned house:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>The house known as &quot;The Castle&quot; which has been abandoned for about 25 years. It is located in the town of Nakskov, the biggest city on Lolland, but still only with 15000 citizens. The architecture is of course very unusual, so it is difficult to guess a construction year, but people in the area say it was built in the 1920's, by an old eccentric German man. The building has scared many people with it's fairytale-like, but yet scary appearance, and it is no wonder that there are stories about hauntings in this house. Why else would such a beautiful house have been abandoned? All the windows are yellow-shaded glass, and if you are lucky enough to get a short look inside (because of the height of the windows) you can see old renaissance-like furniture inside. This is not a joke - there are really old red silk-upholstery covered golden chairs standing inside this house. Maybe stolen or fake copies - I don't know, but remarkable for sure. The only windows that are not covered with yellow glass are the cellar windows, but they are, on the otherhand, barred windows. You can see about two yards in due to the old junk and smashed furniture in there.  There is also an old glasshouse on the property with windows smashed by wildly growing vines, and with playing children-image paintings on the house-end brick wall.  Through this glasshouse you can go into some abandoned storage room, which is unfortunately empty. But to my big surprise, the wall was collapsed so it was possible to enter an old, locked garage. Inside this garage two old cars were standing. One was a beautiful Ford T from the 1930's and the other a 1950's Chevrolet. All covered with 30 years of dust and dirt, but except from that in relatively good condition. When I get time to get back to Lolland, there is a lot to explore in this big mysterious house.</i></blockquote>
