On May 26, 2008 I received an e-mail from an anonymous visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Here is my Ouija board story that is true - no word is a lie.
<br><br>
I was seven at time, and I always used Ouija boards with my friend (I'm not using names - read on if you want to know why)
<br><br>
We used it at an abandoned church near where I live.  It was around 12:00 at night.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits with us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes (after 2 minutes)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you good or bad?  If you are good, say something good about god.<br>
Board: (moves to no)<br>
<br>
My friend: Why are you bad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Well, show yourself then because I'm not scared.<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Me and my friend: Well, you are a weak spirit and couldn't hurt anyone.<br>
Board: Watch what you say or else<br>
<br>
My friend gets up and does a chicken dance.
<br><br>
Me: Ok, stop that friend or I'm putting the board away.<br>
Board: Its to late for your friend (<i>the planchette goes through the alphabet backwards really fast...we did not stop it because we thought it was nothing at the time.</i>)<br>
<br>
Board: If I was you, not your friend, I would run now<br>
<br>
We suddenly heard a scream.<br>
<br>
My friend levitates in the air and starts to bleed from his ears.  I get some holy water and throw it on him.
<br><br>
He falls to the ground, gets and picks up a nearby piece of sharp wood and throws it through my arm.  Then he starts chanting &quot;here comes the devil.&quot;
<br><br>
Me: No! Stop!
<br><br>
I pick up the board, rip it up, then burn and bury it.  Next I start to read a charm from a piece of paper, then call forth my spirit guide.
<br><br>
My friend falls on the floor, and I still have the wood in my arm and am still bleeding. I start crying, then my friend wakes up and remembers everything.  He says he is sorry, I take the wood out and wrap it with a piece of cloth from my t-shirt, and we run to my friend's house and tell his dad everything.  His dad treats my wound and blesses us all (his dad is Christian).
<br><br>
To this day I have never used a ouija since then, so I'm telling you to be very careful when you use one.
<br><br>
I didn't use names just in case we encounter that spirit again, because it is released from the board.
