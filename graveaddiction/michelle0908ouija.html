On September 6, 2008 I received an e-mail from Michelle about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I am 16, and I have recently had an eerie experience with a ouija board. A friend and I had tried it previously, and it had never been successful until now. I have become very interested ever since then, because the feeling I got while doing the ouija board was unlike anything I've ever felt. There are supposedly ghost sightings across the street in a house where the younger mother of a little girl asked my friend's grandmother if there were any little girls buired in the graveyard, because the daughter speaks of a little girl whom she sees at night. There are also many stories in her grandmother's house about noises and sightings. We want to try the ouija board inside the most haunted room of the house, but are afraid it could lead to something bad. What do you think? If you have any feedback, I would love to know! Anyway, here is my story.
<br><br>
A close friend of mine is obsessed with ghosts and anything to do with the supernatural. So, one night this past month she decided to sleep right outside the graveyard on a hill behind her house.  The three friends and I were camping, and everything was going fine until the fire burned down and we decided to retire into the tent. After this, the friend and I decided to do the ouija board.  Our other two friends didn't want to participate, so they laid down and closed their eyes to let us try it. After a few moments of silence and mental preparation, she asked it if there were any spirits present. Nothing happened for quite a few moments, until very slowly the pointer moved to yes. At this point I didn't know what to think, but I just followed it. She then asked it how many, and it promptly moved to 6. Then, she asked, &quot;Are you a good spirit?&quot;  After a small pause, the pointer rotated a little and slowly started moving to no. At this point, my adrenaline started to increase, my heart was pumping, and an extremely cold breeze passed by my face. It was so cold, and after the pointer moved to no, she asked, &quot;Do you want to harm us?&quot;  The rotator immediately moved to yes. My friend quickly said goodbye, and the pointer followed. We immediately let go of the pointer and screamed. I know it wasn't her becuase I could feel the force dragging from the other direction! Also, before it had moved after the first question, when I closed my eyes I could see it and feel the drag of the pointer moving beneath me.  But when I had opened my eyes it had not moved an inch yet. It then proceeded in the direction I had felt.

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Michelle, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to her.
