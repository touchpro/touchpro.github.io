On September 17, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kelly T. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me and my friends, Maria, Bria, and Melissa were all talking about playing the ouija board since it was Melissa's first time. So since my friend Maria and I always play the ouija board in my room, she got a little bored and suggested we play it outside.
<br><br>
We set up outside wih the usual protection spell, board, planchette, and candles. We started asking for spirits, and as usual we got one. We don't usually ask names of spirits since most of the time the spirit always changes. If we do ask, we sometimes get XYZ which we just say means classified. Also, my friends wanted to experience something so we asked the board if I could get them to feel and it said yes. So of course they eventually did feel something, but moving on...
<br><br>
We asked if we were going to talk to any evil spirits, and it said yes. I asked if we were already, and it said yes. My friend's back started to hurt and we asked if it was them...it said yes. We asked politely for it to stop, and it said SORRY and stopped. Also, since we were outside, we were behind my dad's car.  My friends and I started saying how it would be realy creepy if the car started. All of a sudden my aunt pulled in the driveway, got out, and walked inside after teling us how &quot;evil&quot; the ouija board is. That's where it took a turn for the worst.  I felt like something was right near her car, and I was really sure it was there. It was just sitting there, and it seemed as if it was waiting for something. After a few minutes I asked my friend who has experienced some things during the session if she felt something over there. As soon as I brought it to her attention, she said yes. We both said that it felt neutral, and that we didn't think it was going to do anything.
<br><br>
So eventually we got tired of playing and we closed the session. I stood up, and immediately looked at the area near the car where the figure was (since I had been doing it almost the whole session). As soon as I did that, the candle blew out (there was no wind and no one blew on it).  My friend said she saw a grey light float up and away. As soon as that happened I again looked at the area and could actually see the figure getting up and coming towards us at a fast walk. Me and my friend (Bria) didn't even exchange words or glances, but yet we both said run!! The figure had gone from neutral to completely horrible with the worst intentions. We all ran inside and were completely shaken up from that experience.
<br><br>
Later on we went into my room and started playing again since everyone always feels safe in my room. We asked our trusty spirit friend Mac if that thing was evil, and of course he said yes. Mac is supposedly my protector, so I absolutely adore the spirit =) We asked what the intentions of the spirit was, and he said BEAT.  We asked WHO, and he replied KELLY (ME). Luckily I don't get freaked out too easily. My friend Melissa then asked if he was assigned to anyone else, would he have killed them and it said yes. Since this was kind of freaking out my friends, we picked a different topic. I got tired so I supposedly transferred my energy to my friend...that way she can make the planchette move without me using it. Yay, it worked! She spoke with a 6 year old named Alex who is a bit crazy. We still talk to Alex and Mac, but we dare not ever play the ouija board outside ever again!
<br><br>
I'm not going to say that the ouija board is evil, and yes, I still play it. I just warn people to expect the unexpected when playing outside.
