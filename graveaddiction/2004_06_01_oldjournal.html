I had a great time with <a href="./solstice/index.html">Kate</a> at this evening's &quot;Dinner and a Cemetery&quot; excursion.  I'm not going to write about it here though...I thought the cemetery we visited was so interesting, exciting, and creepy that I couldn't wait to add the photos to the site.  Yeah, I'm an obsessed cemetery freak and added them to the site tonight!  Just a few minutes ago, to be exact :)  So instead of me rambling on and on, <a href="colestrat.html">click here to see the photos and stories!</a><br><br>

Well, I didn't make it to the campout/ghost hunt this weekend...my allergies were awful!  I was even getting hives, which never happens.  I was a little disappointed, but I guess it was a good excuse to not camp on the wet, squishy ground.<br /><br />Anyway, I survived the training I went to last week.  It actually wasn't too bad at all, the class I was in had a bunch of fun people.  I wish I could say the same about the &quot;Get Motivated!&quot; seminar I went to on Monday!  Battling tons of traffic at the arena sucked (if I had known it wasn't going to rain I would have just walked there), and the seminar was way too long.  It lasted from 8AM until sometime after 5PM.  None of the speakers really inspired or motivated me, I was very disappointed.  The rest of my team felt the same. Between the seminar and the training last week, I think I'm motivated out!<br /><br />Last week's dinner with my friend Jennifer was a bunch of fun too.  After we ate, Jennifer suggested Putt-Putt golf.  I hadn't done that for YEARS (I think August of 1996 was the last time before last week!)!!  I warned her that I really suck at Putt-Putt, but I actually ended up surprising myself by how good I did.  It was great to catch up with her.  Hopefully it won't be another four month period before I see her again.<br /><br />Really, nothing else too exciting has happened since the last time I posted.  I'm on vacation Friday, so after today I only have one day of work left this week!!  If the weather is decent, I'm planning to head over to <a href="prospect.html">Prospect Place</a> in Dresden, OH for a Civil War reenactment.  Other than that, it should be a pretty quiet weekend!<br><br>

I decided I better take the time to blog tonight since it may be a few days before I get a chance to blog again...these few days are going to be busy!  And no <a href="http://bluethrill.net/blog" target="_blank">Dave</a>, I don't think it's because I'm super extremely popular! :)  It just seems to be the month to catch up with friends.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm in a company training session.  It's supposed to be a lot of fun, but I'm not really looking forward to it.  It's one of those training things to learn more about leadership, personality types, etc.  See, I'm the type who would prefer a training class where I learn a new skill like coding, etc.  But this is required training for the whole department, so I'll be there.  Mark is going to meet me at my place and ride to the training with me.  It's at Franklin University, so I'm a lot closer than he is...plus, I know how to get there and he doesn't :)  <br /><br />After training, I'm meeting my friend Jennifer for dinner.  I'm not sure where we're going yet, but I'm meeting at her place near Brice Road, so there are plenty of places to choose from.  Jenni is one of my friends from high school, and I haven't seen her since...get this...<b>FEBRUARY</b>.  There's no excuse for that, Canal Winchester isn't very far away.  But we both have pretty hectic schedules, so I guess we can use that as an excuse, right?  When I talked to her Monday night we both promised to be better about keeping in touch!  I'm looking forward to dinner with her, we have lots to catch up on (even though we did talk for an hour on the phone!).  <br /><br />I think I'll go to my parents' house on Friday night after work.  I haven't seen my &quot;little brothers&quot; (the wiener dogs) for a few weeks, and I guess they miss me, their favorite &quot;Biscuit and Treat Lady&quot;.  They love it when I visit, because I tend to be pretty generous with the dog treats...especially Pupperoni, their favorite!  Also, my mom and sister got a three new barn cats.  I guess they're pretty fiesty little kittens, so it will be fun to meet them.  <br /><br />As long as it doesn't rain on Saturday (or if the risk drops below the 70% chance predicted on <a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com" target="_blank">the news</a> tonight) I'll be attending the annual <a href="http://www.majda.net" target="_blank">MAJDA</a> campout/ghost hunt at Beaver Creek State Park.  I haven't camped in years, I'm really looking forward to it.  Plus, there's plenty of haunted places to explore up there!  <br /><br />So that's about it for tonight.  Hopefully I'll have more time to blog this week, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you :)<br><br>

I stole this from <a href="http://caterwauling.com/blog/" target="_blank">Dawn's blog</a>:<br /><br /><b>A - Act your age?</b> Maybe sometimes.  Ever since I was in the second grade people have accused me of acting years beyond my actual age.  But I know I can act a lot younger than my age sometimes too :)<br /><br /><b>B - Born on what day of the week?</b> I believe it was a Saturday.<br /><br /><b>C - Chore you hate?</b> I hate vacuuming...I always suck up things with the vacuum that I shouldn't.  I also despise cleaning the fish tank...immersing my arm up to my elbow in scummy fish water is not my idea of fun!<br /><br /><b>D - Dad's name?</b> Don.<br /><br /><b>E- Essential makeup item?</b> I'm not one to wear makeup.  My friend Laurie said it best...it just wears off or smears on everything.  I do use chapstick though!<br /><br /><b>F - Favorite actor?</b> Johnny Depp<br /><br /><b>G - Gold or silver?</b> Silver, I rarely wear anything gold.<br /><br /><b>H - Hometown?</b> Baltimore, Ohio.  It's about 30 miles SE of Columbus.<br /><br /><b>I - Instruments you play?</b> I played tenor, soprano, and alto sax in high school.  I was in the marching, concert and jazz bands.  I also play clarinet and trombone.<br /><br /><b>J - Job title?</b> That used to be an easy question to answer before they renamed our job titles...I was a Senior Systems Analyst.  Now I think I'm technically a Senior IT Quality Assurance/Testing Analyst.  <br /><br /><b>K - Kids?</b> No, just pet frogs and fish.  I don't know if I can see myself ever having kids.  Babies terrify me, I don't start liking kids until they can communicate with me.<br /><br /><b>L - Living arrangements?</b> I rent an apartment in Columbus, OH.<br /><br /><b>M - Mom's name?</b> Karen.<br /><br /><b>N - Need...</b> Sleep!  I'm telling you, I haven't had a really good night's sleep for weeks!<br /><br /><b>O - Overnight hospital stays?</b> Nope.<br /><br /><b>P - Phobia?</b> Spiders, Centipedes, Millipedes, needles (like shots and giving blood).<br /><br /><b>Q - Quote you like?</b> I know there are a few quotes I've heard and liked, but I honestly can't remember them.  I rarely use quotes in conversation.<br /><br /><b>R - Religious affiliation?</b> None really.  I guess you could call me pagan, but I don't get into circles, ceremonies, or anything like that...I think that's too close to organized religion for me.  I practice the religion of Beth.  I don't steal, murder, or anything like that.  I try to live a good life, and I think that's the only important thing.<br /><br /><b>S - Siblings?</b> I have one sister, she's 23.<br /><br /><b>T - Time you wake up?</b> Usually I wake up around 5:30AM :(<br /><br /><b>U - Unique talent?</b> I don't think I have any talents that are unique.  Well, there is the &quot;weather toe&quot;.  I can predict storms with the big toe on my left foot.  I broke that toe and the bone that connects the toe to my foot when I was four.  Ever since, whenever a storm is approaching my foot cramps and the toe sticks out at a really weird (and painful!) angle.  My family finds it extremely humorous. I, however, don't find it quite as funny...it hurts!!!<br /><br /><b>V - Vegetable you refuse to eat?</b> It'd probably be easier to list the veggies I WILL eat! :)  I like lettuce, broccoli (only cooked with no butter or cheese), lima beans, carrots, and mushrooms. <br /><br /><b>W - Worst habit?</b> Biting my fingernails.<br /><br /><b>X - X-rays you've had?</b> My teeth at the dentist, and my foot when I was four (see &quot;U&quot; above).<br /><br /><b>Y - Yummy food you make?</b> Maybe it's not a unique talent, but I do have talent when it comes to cooking.  There aren't too many bad things I do make.  I think my favorites are chicken enchiladas, chicken curry, lemon lime cake, vanilla bean cheesecake, and cinnamon cheese bars.  My mom is an awesome cook and my grandma was too, must be inherited.<br /><br /><b>Z - Zodiac Sign?</b> Taurus - and I fit the description almost 100%!<br><br>

My answers to this week's <a href="http://ki0sk.org/four/" target="_blank">Friday Four</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Favorite card game and why?</b><br><br>I've never really gotten into card games.  I think I may have played Go Fish, War, and Solitaire a few times when I was a kid, but I don't think I have enough experience to pick a favorite!<br><br><br /><li><b>Favorite video game and why?</b><br><br>Hahaha, I'm really not a big video game fan either :)  I do enjoy Tetris on my super old Nintendo though.<br><br><br /><li><b>Favorite board game and why?</b><br><br>Well, I'm sure everyone knows my answer to this one...the Ouija board, of course!  My second favorite would have to be Life.<br><br><br /><li><b>Favorite any-other-type-of-game and why?</b><br><br>I love Pictionary, but we never use the board part of the game when we play...just the cards.  We pick a number, and when one team has reached that goal they win.<br /></ol><br />Now it's time for me to get ready for work!<br /><br><br>

<b>Interpretive Art</b><br /><br />Today my coworker Pat stopped by my desk.  While he was there, he used small binder clips to create a stunning piece of art with a deep meaning.  I finally found a meaning that was suitable to Pat, but I told him I'd post a photo of his masterpiece in my blog to see what my friends think this masterpiece symbolizes.  Here's the photo:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/patart2.jpg" alt="the masterpiece"></center><br /><br />I'm not going to tell you what I think it symbolizes just yet :)<br /><br />Oh, and before I forget...I have another photo I've been meaning to post.  My parents just recently had a split rail fence put up, and this is a warning sticker that was posted on the post driver:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/bloodyhand.jpg" alt="warning"></center><br /><br />OK, I guess it's not really that funny...but I found the spurting blood quite humorous for some reason!  It's not everyday you see a warning sticker like that!<br /><br />Anyway, today was a fun day at work.  I got a lot of work done, but I had many interesting conversations.  Everything from spicy food to glassware to cemeteries.  Well OK, I manage to talk about cemeteries everyday :)  I am really tired tonight though.  Not so much because of work, but because I stayed up later than I planned to last night.  I went over to Mark's place so he could help me check out a fuse in the truck, and so he would be there if I ended up needing help changing the truck's running light bulb.  I figured I'd be there two hours, but it ended up being four and a half!  Not only did we work on Chuck (the Truck), but we went to a cemetery, ate dinner, and watched an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard.  It was a fun night.<br /><br />However, I had A LOT to do after I got home from Mark's house last night.  Today was my team's monthly birthday celebration, and I needed to bring snacks in.  I stopped at Meijer's since it's on the way home from Mark's place.  I bought bunches of fruit to make fruit salad, and I had to pick up smarties (you know, the roll candies) since Mark's birthday was one of the ones being celebrated and that's one of his favorite candies.  Mike, Jen, and Carol took care of his other favorites - Kit Kat bites, store brand vanilla sandwich cookies, and maple donuts.  Anyway, it took awhile to cut up the fruit, plus the drive home sucked...it was POURING and the rain really slowed traffic down.  So yeah, I got to bed late.  It was worth it though, I thought the fruit salad turned out awesome!<br /><br />Tonight I got the truck's A/C recharged.  It hadn't been working for awhile - it would blow out air, but not cold air :(  That's why Mark and I checked out the fuse last night.  Believe it or not, waiting for the A/C to be recharged wasn't too bad.  The mechanic let me watch, and he did a good job explaining everything that was going on.  Car stuff really intrigues me, so I enjoyed that.  My A/C is working fine now.  They didn't find any leaks, so hopefully it will continue to work great for a long time!  And to make the &quot;adventure&quot; even better...I noticed they had trouble finding pens when I went to sign the receipt.  So you know what I did?  I gave them a couple Grave Addiction pens to use at the shop!!!  Yeah, I'm a geek when it comes to the site!  Oh OK, fine...I'm a just a geek in general :)<br /><br />When I got home I called this lady in Vinton County who needed to interview me for a school project.  She's taking a powerpoint class, and her professor wanted the class to do their presentations on haunted places.  How cool is that?!  I would have loved to have an assignment like that!  Anyway, she had a bunch of good questions for me, and she's also planning to share some of her research about <a href="egrave.html">Elisabeth's Grave</a> with me to use on the site! <br /><br />So overall it's been a good couple of days.  Now I just can't wait until this weekend...cemetery exploring in Gallipolis, OH and Mason County, WV!!!!!  Oh, and since I haven't posted about it in the blog, there have been a few updates to the site since the last entry...you can see them by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />I think that's it for tonight! <br><br>

Well, needless to say I've been really busy lately...I can't believe I haven't posted anything here since 5/24!  By the time I get home and get everything done that I need to with the apartment, friends, and the site I just don't feel much like blogging.<br /><br />But I thought I'd make time to write tonight.  No particular reason, I just felt like I needed to get a post out here for June :)  I'm not going to write about everything that's been going on the past couple weeks, I think I'll just start with today.  <br /><br />The highlight of the day was lunch with my friend Thiru, he's one of the programmers I used to work with in my old area.  It was great to talk with him and catch up, and lunch was awesome...we went to the Hunan Lion at Mill Run.  I had heard wonderful things about it, but today was the first time I went there.  I had Hunan Chicken.  It was really good, and quite spicy.  I love hot food, I have a pretty high tolerance to spicy stuff.  But my heat tolerance was nothing compared to Thiru...he got his Hunan Chicken extra spicy AND added hot sauce to it.  I was impressed, there's no way I could have eaten that stuff extra spicy and enjoyed it!<br /><br />I also talked to some of my other friends from the old area today.  I went upstairs to drop some of the Grave Addiction pens off at Thiru's desk.  While I was up there I decided to stop by my friend Karen's desk to talk about some photos I found on the internet.  The photos were of someone we both know, and that's all I'm going to say.  While I was talking with her a bunch of my other coworkers stopped by.  It's always fun to talk with them.  But never once have I considered going back to that area yet, I'm very happy with my current team.<br /><br />Anyway, that's about all that happened today.  Well, I did talk to my mom on the phone tonight about her grandchildren.  Well, I should say her LACK of grandchildren.  She was telling me that she's going to have to start hanging photos of their three wiener dogs on her desk and tell people that they're her grand-dachshunds.  That totally cracked me up!  I told her she was bugging the wrong kid, she should be bugging my sister and her boyfriend about grandchildren instead of me!  Remember, I'm a <a href="http://quirkyalone.net/qa/" target="_blank">&quot;QuirkyAlone&quot;</a> (I'm so glad <a href="http://bluethrill.net/blog" target="_blank">Dave</a> shared that term with me!).<br /><br />So that's about it.  Yeah, not too exciting.  Perhaps I'll find more time to blog again this week!<br><br>
