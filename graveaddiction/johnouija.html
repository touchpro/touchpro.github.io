On May 20, 2005 I received an e-mail from John about his creepy ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Well, I had heard about the ouija board through my friends who had tried it the weekend before. They told me a story about how the night after they had used their ouija board they experienced weird events. For instance, my one friend Jaime was using the ouija and had gotten a phone call from her mother, who was in a panic, asking if Jaime was alright.  She had gotten a phone call from her cell phone in her voice saying that she needed help and that she was in trouble...but Jaime had never called her.  That same night my friend Kathy, who was at the meeting, told me that when she had gotten home she had a dream that her friends and her were at the same place where they used the ouija, and that they were doing it and they were all surrounded by dead bodies! 
<br><br>
Well, we decided that because of what happened it would be a good idea to go out, buy our own board, and experience the ouija. So one day after school my friends and I went to the mall and bought ourselves a brand new ouija board. That night we all gathered at my house and sat in a circle with white candles lit and started our first ouija experience. 
<br><br>
I will just tell you the freaky incidents that occured that night. First off, my friend Sarah had to leave early but she had gotten in a few chances at the board. When she left she had gotten a phone call from her mother. She had no radio on, and no one was in the car with her.  Her mother swore that she had heard people in the background talking. Well, after that she had called me and explained what had happened.  Later on we decided to ask one of the men we were talking to if he had anything to do with what had happened to our friend.  He told us that it was not him, but he knew who was doing it.  He also told us it was one of the evil spirits.  Well, after that we were still talking to our friend, who by that time had given us a code to make sure it was him for when we came back from our breaks. Then the man told us that he enjoyed koolaid so my friend decided he would go and make some for him to be stupid. So, after it was made we told him about it and he told me that if i drank any of it he would kill me. Even worse,  after we were getting mad at him my friend who made him the koolaid asked him to give us a sign that he was there, because we were previously getting to signals.  Right after he said that, I flipped the board because I was afraid he would enter my room.  All of a sudden my friend's shirt spontaneously caught on fire. Now, before we did not believe that the ouija was real...but now I believe that we all strongly believe that it is true.&quot;
