On March 13, 2007 I received an e-mail from Atom about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
When I was 23 years old (I am 34 years old now), I lived in a small town in Colorado. I had many close friends, but three friends like brothers. One of my friends, I will call him Joe, had a Ouija board that he got from his uncle. Joe's mother was a practicing witch, if you believe that sort of thing. One night we were all staying the night at Joe's house and he decided that bringing the Ouija board out would be a good Idea. I did not want to participate, because my mother had a bad experience with a Ouija board and always told us never to use one. Joe and my other friends convinced me to participate.
<br><br>
Joe's room was upstairs in his house and he lived on the outskirts of town. He began asking if there was anyTHING out there.  Well something ansered, it said its name was something I cannot pernounce to this day, Artilics (ar-til-la-cus), it said it was the demon of hate. My friends, being the idiots they were, started to joke with it and make fun of it, thinking that it was one of us having fun. This enraged the being, and it suddenly began to get very cold in our spot,
we saw a small black circle appear in the middle of the room, and it began to smell like something died.  I remember this part well, a thunderous voice said &quot;Who has summoned me?&quot; and we ran out of the room. Joe's mother worked as a waitress graveyard shift at a truck stop not far from his house.  We drove over ther as fast as we could and told his mother about the incident. She was very upset and said we have most likely unleashed something we did not understand. We went back in the morning after waiting for his mother to get off work.  The Ouija board was taken, we could not find it anywhere. We spent a week looking for the board.  The smell never left his room, no matter how much spray he would use. I truly think we did bring something about ourselves, because it all got worse from here. Joe ended up having paranoid schizphranea, and our other friend's mother was murdered by her boyfriend whom we knew and was the nicest guy in the world.
<br><br>
I am the only one who has not been affected YET, but I read on because I someday hoped to educate the teenagers out there who think that using these boards is a trick. Please remember, do not use the Ouija board unless you are of sound mind and body, are extremely confident and faithful in yourself, or your religion. Believe me, your weaknesses will be exploited.
