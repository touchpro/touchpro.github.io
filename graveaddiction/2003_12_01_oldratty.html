		<div class="content">I am so totally excited!!!  Mommy has a new Dell pc and I can blog in comfort and at my leisure now.  I will have to mark mommy with the scent glands under my chin so the whole world knows she is mine and that I love her.  I just love giving her kitty kisses (especially right after I have cleaned my ass with my tongue) and then chinning her so she is a marked woman.  Silly mommy, I have never told her but she doesn't have scent glands under her chin.  Silly mommy must think humans are like cats because sometimes she rubs her chin on my head.  I love it though, reminds me of a time long ago before I was ripped away from my kitty mommy.  Wonder if my kitty mommy is still alive.  Her name is Molly and I look just like her.  I had a black brother, two yellow brothers and a sister who was a tortie just like me.  No one knows what became of my black brother, my two yellow brothers got a home together but one of them developed a heart condition and died (too many fatty mice?) and tradgedy befell my poor sister.  She was taken from us very early by a man who knew everything about cats.  He kept her caged for hours and hours and then would be upset when she ran around the house like a mad cat.  Duh, dumbass, she was burning off excess kitten energy, but anyway, he had wanted her as a lapcat for his old mommy and a lap cat was the last thing she was.  She lived there with the old lady and gay guy until she was 4 then it happened.  He called the lady that owned us originally and wanted her to take my sister back.  Seems my sister bit his mother.  Well, the lady had a zillion cats of her own and could not take my sister back so the gay guy took her to the vet and got her a shot of the purple juice.  You never wake up after you get a shot of that.  Wicked wicked people, she was just being a kitty and I bet if she did bite the old lady it was an accident.  Guess that was better than dumping her like some of the asshole people do to their pets but still, she was just a girl in her prime.  I am so glad my mommy got me.  I have been beat with a loaf of bread, I have been smacked and shaken, I have been stepped on....hmmmm, most of this have come from mommy's mommy and daddy....but never anything that hurt me badly.  The bread incident was the best.  Mommy's mommy had bought a loaf of bread with pepperoni in it.  Heavenly, fragrant, tasty pepperoni...but let me continue and left it fully wrapped on the kitchen table overnight.  What was a girl to do?  I hopped right up and tore a hole in the middle of the package and nibbled out the whole middle.  When mommy's mommy saw it the next morning she started to swear (which she can do better than most sailors), grabbed me, grabbed the bread and smacked me with it.  Everyone laughed except mommy's mommy and mommy.  Mommy was upset that I was being beat and mommy's mommy was mad at her and at me and was ready to beat us both with a loaf of bread.  Wonder if she ever knew how stupid she looked??  Poor woman, tries to keep the house under control but with mommy's daddy, Beth the Brutal and me and mommy it is surprising she has any sanity left.  Now with the three dolts...errrr, I mean dogs that live with us I figure she will be committed in a year or so.  I must say though, it does bother me that every Christmas that witch asks for a cattle prod or a stun gun.  Scary lady.  She says she likes machetes too.....I think she is just kidding.  Who knows, how many other old women do you know that look forward to attending Ozzfest each year.  Those bands and those people are scary but she just LOVES going.<br /><br />Mommy is pretty pissed at me.  I like to help with her new hobby, quilting.  She had a whole lot of those squares and things that she cuts out all over the basement floor and they looked so orderly that I just had to rearrange them...all over the basement.  So much fun running through quilt pieces.  I also like laying on her fabric.  What would new fabric be without some rattycatt hairs for flavor?  She just doesn't appreciate my hard work.<br /><br />Well, mommy's mommy is petting Max the Mangler, Eater of Curtains.  He is happy again.  I liked it better when the fuckup was depressed.  He wouldn't kick anyone, he stopped growling, he just sat and looked sad.  I kept telling them to give him a shot of the purple juice or at least take him to the pound, it is the Christmas season, probably someone would have adopted him before he got the lethal injection but no one listens to me.  Just wait until the curtains come back this week and the dipshit decides to chew again.  Just hope it is not while mommy and Mike are babysitting the dumbasses.  Can you believe it, they have to have babysitters.  They get lonely if mommy's mommy and daddy leave them for too long and that upsets daddy so he has mommy and Mike babysit.  THEY ARE DOGS!!!!  There are little kids in this world that do not get treated so well and these retarded people do not understand why I get so pissy.  No one cares if I am left alone, hell, half the time my food bowl is empty, there are no POUNCES to be found and there is dog slobber in my water but does anyone care?  Well in fairness mommy and Mike care but they are in LLLOOOOOVVVVEEEEE with each other and sometimes forget that I should be #1 in their lives.  Mommy's mommy and Beth have pity sometimes but only after I pester them to death.  Mommy's daddy rarely pays any attention to me.  I did startle him the other day when he was putting in the phone line for mommy's pc.  I walked right across his lap, stupid bastard, and scared him.  Plus he was busy and concentrating so my bothering him really pissed him off.  I say I scored three points for that one.<br />Well, time for me to go, the room has just been invaded by three worthless sub-animal creatures.  Got to run, really.   TTYL, Ratty the Ruler.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Wooohooooo!!!!  Anyone catch the error in my blog entry yesterday, spell check certainly did not.  I made Beth the Brutal sound like Beth the Butt Pirate!!!  Good old Beth, checking out my bowel....find any turdsicles?  I laughed so hard I fell off the footstool I was sitting on.  Gives a whole new meaning to Beth the Brutal.  That one little error was more fun than a cattle prod in a room full of crowded people.<br /><br />I mentioned cattle prod....mommy's mommy asked Beth the Brutal to get her one for Christmas.  Not a good idea, she would have way too much fun with something like that.  I can see her saying to people...say hello to my little friend, right before she gave them a nudge...she is a bad person.  She really must be in a mood, the word "fuckin" proceeds almost every statement.  Example, "I do not give a big fat hairy rat's ass if the fuckin' tree gets decorated or not" or "who gives a shit if we decorate the outside of the fuckin' house this year.  Just going to take the fuckin' stuff down in three week's time anyway."  Ahhhh, the sounds of the season.  I cannot wait until she does start to decorate the tree, the air turns blue from the swears.  I really admire a woman that can let her true feelings show and not give a fuck...ya know what I mean?<br /><br />I mentioned turdsicles earlier.  Ya know, I hate bathes but mommy's mommy the bitch seems to think I need one at least once per year.  Whatever.....I clean myself, I have a tongue, I can lick my butt.  But once in a while I miss something and then I get turdsicles.  Everyone hates seeing them but what is a girl like me to do?  Just wanted to explain the concept.<br /><br />Well, time to go.  Until later!</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello, I'm baaacccckkkk and wow, has a lot happened!!!<br /><br />Well, let's see, there was Thanksgiving.  Mommy's mommy spent lots of time in the kitchen and the whole house smells wonderful.  She was bitchy though!  Crabbed around about all the housework, laundry and extra baking, I mean really, doesn't she have a clue?!  Everything is her responsibility and to expect help is just asking too much.  Plus, if she does get help why shouldn't she have to thank them over and over again....I actually heard her say no one ever thanks her for anything she does, like dishes, shitty toilet bowel cleaning, sweeping, dusting, billpaying, keeping everyone's schedules, well, you get the point.  She just needs to accept the fact that most slaves were freed, she wasn't and it is her responsibility and to expect thanks or any appreciation is ridiculous.  So much for her.  Anyway, the meal was really good and yes, I got some samples of turkey and BLISS, HEAVEN, Food for the gods, I got the liver.  She always cooks it just for me and it is so tender and tasty.  Of course, I don't thank her.<br /><br />Mommy ordered a PC from Dell.  She was pissed and let everyone know it.  Seems Dell charged her 2X for one PC...that upset her.  Upset her more when she called and told them that was her problem, take it up with her credit card company.  Luckily Mommy has a good credit card company and they called with Mommy on the line and Mommy said the rep from the CC company was very nasty to the rep from Dell and even threatened to take further action.  Mommy was happy, her account was straightened out.  But then more bad news, Dell ships by UPS and no one was home to sign for the delivery.  Big problem because after the third time you have to pick it up and that is right in the area where the sniper shootings are in Ohio right now.  Well, to the rescue, guess who?  Yep, Mommy's mommy took time off work, stayed home and signed for it.  After all, she is the Mommy and it is her duty  :- )  However, Mommy's mommy did thank her so she was okay with it.<br /><br />Now for the biggest event....the curtain incident!!!  Max, the dumbass, is incapable of learning.  When he first invaded my space almost a year ago, after the first week they trusted him to be out when not supervised and lo and behold the raving dumbass tore a hole...a giant hole...right in the middle of the big French door curtain, you know, the expensive kind.  Mommy's mommy went ballistic that time.  She put him in the kennel so she would not hit him and kill him (which I was hoping she would do and she really wanted to) but she was so mad she was picking up the kennel and slamming it around.  He was stressed, Mommy's daddy was stressed (that was one of his boys) but he also knew better than interfere, she yelled at everyone...well, it was just ugly.  I thought the top of her head would blow up!  Scariest thing I ever saw.  So here it is a year later, Mommy's mommy has a girls' lunch out with some of her friends, comes home and notices...Max ate the replacement curtain!!!!  Mommy's daddy was lazy and irresponsible and left Max unattended and Max, the total idiot, ate the curtain.  It was really ugly again.  She yelled at Max, at Mommy's daddy, she screamed, she cried and was in danger again of losing the top of her head.  I yowled but she was so pissed she didn't care.  Fortunately this curtain can be repaired but it will take two weeks.  Mommy's daddy is a dumbass too, he yelled that he was sorry and it was all his fault and now he is so dumb he cannot understand why she will not look at or pet Max and is barely civil to him.  Duh, a sincere apology without shouting and all the dramatics (as only he can do) would have gone a long way but he is not very smart sometimes so I know that is asking way too much.  He still hasn't really made amends and I am not sure he will ever be smart enough to sincerely apologize for his stupidity and laziness.  Mommy's mommy said this is the last straw and it will be a cold day in Hell before she forgives and forgets this event.<br /><br />Because of all of this so far the Christmas tree is up and in the living room and Mommy's mommy, after all it is her job, said the tree will be natural this year...no lights or decorations...she is refusing to decorate.  She also said she doesn't give a shit if the outside gets decorated or not.  As a matter of fact, she really does have major attitude and I can tell she is holding lots in and wow, when it breaks loose.........don't worry, I can see a major air-clearing battle brewing and I will be sure to blog about it.  The only thing that will shatter my hopes for a full blown battle that will result in the placement of Max in a new home (a dream come true for me) would be if Mommy's daddy gets a brain and sincerely apologizes and like maybe takes mommy's mommy out for a nice dinner and lots of ass-kissing and groveling......she can be wicked and would take all of that I think.  I love her, she is my kind of person.<br /><br />Mommy has been sick, work stress.  I think she should quit and stay home with me.  Who needs a job, she still lives at home and I know Mommy's mommy would take care of us.  After all, she takes her responsibilities seriously...way too seriously but that is good for the rest of the family.  Anyway, mommy is sick and I worry about mommy.  I was blaming that Mike at first but I think he is being good and I think it is just mommy's job.<br /><br />Poor Beth the Brutal.  She still visits and she was there during the fiasco of the curtain and she tried to be the peacemaker but she did not suceed.  She has been very good about Pounces for me and she always checks my bowel.  She will be down this weekend to hook up mommy's pc because Beth the Brutal is a geek and has her own website, www.graveaddiction.com and the Brutal does lots of techie kind of stuff.  Makes me laugh.  I like growling at her just because she is funny to me.  She is also a pest sometimes and doesn't let go of me.  She will learn someday.<br /><br />So been very exciting around the house.  Scary, exciting, noisy, stressful....ahhhh family life.  At least they all still have jobs, are fairly healthy (well maybe not mommy), and have each other and me and those dumbass, retarded, brain-dead, untrainable, shit-eating dachshunds.<br /><br />Enough already?  Let's tell the raccoon story.  Seems the dumbasses were let out to piss and mommy's daddy noticed a raccoon, not uncommon, up by the garage.  He threw a stone at it to scare it away and whoa, it came toward him.  So he managed to get the idiots into the house without them seeing it (because of course they would attack like they have a chance) and then he went back to ask mommy's mommy what to do.  This was before the curtain incidence or she would have handled it herself :- ) but she told him to let her look.  She went out and clapped and shouted and it came toward her.  Then he went out and poked it with a broom and it still came at him.  So mommy's mommy made the decision...something was wrong and it would have to be shot.  Where we live we get sick or diseased wildlife frequently and animal control just says shoot it, so we do.  Anyway, the raccoon went to raccoon heaven.  Probably should have had it tested for rabies or distemper but they just took it back in the field and buried it.  Living in the country can be scary sometimes.<br /><br />Gotta go for now.....oh wait, by the way, mommy's mommy has a really really foul mouth, she said more bads in more combinations than I have ever heard in my life!  Just had to tell you all about that.<br /><br />Until the next round,<br />Ratty</div><br>
