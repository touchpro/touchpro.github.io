On May 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Steph Smith about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I wrote to share a story with you about the Ouija.  I've been tempted to get into using the board again, but I am wondering if you could make a post for me or ask your Ouija experts out there for some advice.  Or, perhaps you can answer yourself.
<br><br>
First, my situation and question(s).  I've dabbled in Ouija for a long time.  My best friend and I bought a board in the 6th grade.  Lessee, this was 24 years ago.  I'm 36, was 12 then, yeah.  6th grade.  It took us an hour to get the pointer to move.  We vowed to make it work the way it was supposed to--not pushing or so forth.  Well, our first session was disappointing (when I look back,) but we were excited at the time.  Most of what we got was gibberish, so we stuck to yes and no questions.  We used the board now and then as we grew up, then quite a bit in our mid/late 20's.
<br><br>
Most of the time, we would only get gibberish, or spirits/entities that were extremely uncooperative.  I look at some of the stories and advice on your site and I can see where I can make improvements during the next session.  But, the question is, what kind of advice do you have for people who really only get a bunch of nonsense on the board, or a pointer that goes from one letter to another and back again: AGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAG.  It gets frustrating.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's the partner you're with and other times I wonder if there is anything one can do to nudge a session through this?  I've had
sessions in the past that have been crystal clear, but they are few and far between.
<br><br>
We've thought of using a tape recorder and speaking aloud as to everything we ask and get answers for, then going back and
transcribing it to see if we're missing any misspelled words or rearranged words.
<br><br>
So, any advice would be awesome!
<br><br>
Now, for my most memorable Ouija story.  I was 27 and working the graveyard shift for a 1-900 Tarot line.  The company was great and we all did our readings and tried our best to perfect our Tarot skills.  There was none of this &quot;keep em on the phone as long as possible&quot; nonsense.  It was a good experience, and the more I used my Tarot &quot;muscle&quot; the better I got.
<br><br>
Well, working the graveyard shift means you don't get as many calls.  Our average was 1-3 calls per hour, if that, and this was split up between three people.  On a particularly slow night, we broke the Ouija board out.  I was there with my (then) boyfriend, Kevin, and another woman who was heavy into Wicca and Paganism named Teresa. Well, the board never worked with my boyfriend, so he opted out.  He claimed that the spirits just never liked him.  So, Teresa and I sat to give it a whirl.
<br><br>
The connection was instant and strong.  We spoke with a woman named Grace who Teresa had apparently contacted before.  She was straight-forward, positive, benevolent.  I definitely felt some good mojo from this one.  Then another spirit came to the board.  Her name was Emily and she was a child.  We spent a good 30 minutes with her.  She loved to play Hide and Seek.  The pointer would move in a circle.  That means she was in the process of &quot;hiding.&quot;  When it stopped, we had to look for her.
<br><br>
Me: Are you behind the moon?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Are you behind the sun?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Are you behind the letter X?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
On and on until we found her.  The spirit felt very child-like, precarious, and fun.  Again, this was one of the first times I had ever felt the presence of a spirit on the board so strongly.  My boyfriend sat with us at the board (very interested by now) just to watch, but he did not participate.  Teresa and I sat at each end of the board and he sat at the top where the Yes and No are located, watching.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the pointer stopped &quot;feeling&quot; light and fun.  We would ask questions and receive answers like &quot;fuck you, slut.&quot;  The pointer then spelled out &quot;Tell Kevin to leave.&quot;
<br><br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: He's sitting in my spot.<br>
<br>
Kevin: F* you.  I'm not leaving.<br>
Board: Leave now.<br>
<br>
Well, the pointer started to move very strongly and very angrily.  I was desperate to keep my fingers on the pointer because if I removed them and this thing kept going on its own, I would have been terrified.  Teresa's face began to turn pale and she asked: &quot;Is this Robert?&quot;
<br><br>
Board: Yes<br>
Teresa: Robert, you're not welcome here.  Leave now.  Good-bye.
<br><br>
She then pushed the pointer to Good-bye, but it pushed back and continued to spell out a string of obscenities, calling her a whore, saying he was waiting for her.  We said goodbye again and put the board again.  Teresa then explained the situation.
<br><br>
A few years ago, she had a gathering of friends and acquaintances.  One of the women who attended was apparently caught doing some magic in Teresa's apartment (in Teresa's bedroom where there was an extra bathroom for guests to use.)  The next night, Teresa broke out the Ouija board with a friend and that was her first encounter with Robert.  He was pleasant at first, but became more and more demanding and crude and by the end of the session, he was not welcome anymore.
<br><br>
Teresa then began to experience nightmares about Robert.  In these dreams, he would try to harm her (beat/kill/rape her.)  Teresa's daughter went to use the restroom one night and saw something in the reflection of the mirror that she said looked like a tall, dark, shadowy figure.  When she turned, it was gone.  This happened frequently and also began to happen to Teresa.  She would catch things in the reflection, see things out of the corner of her eye, and continued to have nightmares.  Finally, she called in help.
<br><br>
A woman who was apparently a &quot;Spiritual cleanser&quot; and medium of sorts did a run-down of her apartment.  She asked Teresa if anyone had opened a &quot;door&quot; or &quot;gate&quot; in her home recently.  Teresa said no.  She then remembered the strange woman who was performing magic in her bedroom.  She told the medium about this.  The medium asked for her name.
<br><br>
Teresa: Ruth, her name was Ruth.<br>
Medium: About yay high, red hair?  Kind of pushy?<br>
Teresa: Yeah!<br>
Medium: Not the first time we've had problems with her.  She's a very disturbed individual.
<br><br>
So, Teresa put two and two together and realized that this woman (Ruth) may have indeed opened some kind of portal/door/window to the spirits in Teresa's bedroom, and that Robert had come through.  A cleansing took place.  Teresa said it took weeks to fully get rid of him and not feel afraid anymore.  She hadn't had contact with him for over a year until that night at the Tarot place with me.
<br><br>
I don't know exactly what happened after that.  Teresa didn't work long at the Tarot joint and I never had the means to contact her after she quit.  I hoped that Robert hadn't become a problem again.  I know this may seem a bit fantastic, but I have yet to feel an entity on the board so angry and vicious.  It's like a darkness fell over us that night, a coldness and fear.  It definitely makes one think about taking more precautions when using the board, AND being more careful who they let into their home, especially if they socialize with folks who gravitate toward the darker arts.
