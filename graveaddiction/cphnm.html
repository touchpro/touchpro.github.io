<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana">Chad sent me the following information about the House of Nightmares:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>It was originally a poor house back in the day.  I believe sometime in the mid seventies or so it was converted into some kind of Catholic school for girls or something along those lines.  And rumor has it that an elevator crashed at some point and killed all the girls inside the elevator. Those girls' spirits supposedly roam the halls.  Also, rumor has it that when they tore up the area around the poor house to put in some houses and stuff they dug up lots of unmarked graves.  They say they were the graves of poor people who died while takeing shelter there.  Yes, you got it...those people whose graves were disturbed supposedly haunt the exterrior of this old building.  Up until recently this place was also used as a haunted house attraction during the Halloween season.  Unfortunately, due to a collapse in the buildings interior, I've heard that they're going to be moving the haunted house to some other location in Gambier, OH.
<br><br>
We had a lot of fun exploring this place, it was sweet!!!  While we walked around the grounds outside the buiding taking some photos and such we got the feeling of being watched.  Overall, I would say the grounds around this building at night had a high creep factor.  Once inside the building, however, the creep factor went down.  Maybe the grounds outside are really haunted and the inside of the building isn't.  That was my opinion at least.  Who knows - maybe all the cool props stashed in the building somehow took away from the overall creep factor of the place?
<br><br>
The weird thing is most of the pics we took around the grounds and of the outside of the building had this strange mist in them, even though there wasn't any fog that night. None that we had noticed when taking the photos anyway.  We also had a strange black orb show up in one of the photos that we took inside the building.  Check out the pic of the outside with all the mist - can you see the face in the upper right hand corner of pic?  I have also included pic of said black orb.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In October 2006 I received a couple e-mails from website visitors regarding the House of Nightmares.
<br><br>
The first e-mail was from Andrew Evans:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I just visited your website, and you have incorrect information that was given to you.  The House of Nightmares in Bangs, Ohio was never a Catholic girl's school.  From 1957 until 1988 it was the home of Mount Vernon Bible College.  It was purchase in 1989 by the Chapel Hill Golf Course.  There was never an elevator in that building after 1957, and no one was ever killed in a elevator accident.  This is made up information from those that ran the House of Nightmares to draw customers.</i></blockquote>
<br>
The second e-mail was from an anonymous visitor:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>The building in Bangs, Ohio was my home for 2 years back in the 60's - 1965-1967 to be exact. A nice warm place with narry a ghost or ghoul to be found. It was the Mt. Vernon Foursquare Bible College. Prior to our use it was the county home for elderly people with no place to call home. By the way, the crash of the elevator was made up, and of 100 or so students no one ever saw a ghost. If you notice the cornerstone, the building was constructed in 1857 and dedicated by the county commissioners. The big church on the hill above the school was the local Foursquare Church Chapel that was built in 1967, and now serves as a clubhouse for the golf course.
<br><br>
The pictures were cool but hard to make out anything I remember. The beds and the cabinets in the room were those from the 1960's. If you have any questions you can drop a note. I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it was a nice place to live. It did look better in those days with a large stone and iron gate that surrounded the property. It would have made a better place if they had not torn the great high brick wall down and the iron gates - it kind of made it look like something out of the movies. Shame it is now fallen down and is unsafe to roam.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In February 2007 I received the following e-mail from Steven regarding the Knox County Home:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>396 acres...Homes, a beautiful chapel, chapel pond, gymnasium, mobile classrooms, National Champion Basketball Team.  &quot;Kicked Nazarene Basketball Team's butts all over the Court.&quot;  Great bird hunting, camping out in the &quot;back 40&quot;, girls sneaking to the back 40 so they could sunbathe in their 1970's skimpy Bikinis too.  Guys &quot;accidentally&quot; going out back to check out the sunbathing babes.  Shooting frogs with 22's at the pond, skipping Chapel Services (a weekly requirement), taking girls in cars out to the back roads for &quot;fun&quot;. Long hair, sandals, Nike running shoes, and bell bottoms. Walking the old train tracks and the path across the old island near the campus entry...
<br><br>
Haunted? Yep! That part is correct.  Regularly every semester, at least one student would secretly and embarrassedly make their way to some teacher, talking about how their bed in their locked private dorm room would be shaken in the middle of night until they'd fall to the floor.  All the men's toilet stalls being seen filled by dead male ghosts in the middle of the night, all wearing old early century poorhouse clothes and shoes.  And, yes, the Guy's dorm was the top floor. One of my dorm rooms is the gable just to the left of the center tower. About the dead ghosts at night in the John, sitting on every stool...I know, I saw them myself...you could feel them around all the time.
<br><br>
But, it was a sad day when the denomination leaders did a &quot;chicken run&quot; and fled Bangs!  All of this was Mt. Vernon Bible College!  Yep, I was there. Well, I went on to be a Minister myself. Even had a aay on International TV on the Trinity Broadcasting Network with my wife, seen in 78 countries on TV. So, you see yet?  The Ol' Place wasn't all bad, even if it was haunted - and, yes, it was.  When I saw the photos of the ol' place on the 'net, it almost made me cry...Why?  Well, the first Parish my Dad had back in the 1950's was a little one room clap board church in a little bitty Kansas wheat farmer's town (Pratt, KS).  A few years after that, we were moved by the Denomination to a Parish outside Neosho, MO in the late 50's.  They closed that church less than twenty years after Dad was moved from it too. In 1996, I took my Wife on a trip. We found the old Church in Pratt,  sitting in bad repair too. It was stocked full of someone's junk. Then, went back to Neosho. Found it closed too. That church is somebody's junk storehouse too. In the early 60's Dad was sent to a small Foursquare Parish in Joplin, MO. Great memories there too. But a few years later they sold that Church and the Parsonage too. We learned a few years ago that there's a huge tree grown right up the middle of the old parsonage in Joplin, MO. SO...When Foursquare Leaders pulled the same thing with my Alma Mater, that of course  hurt too. It's like the places of my childhood and youth were trashed by uncaring Church people in that Denomination.  But, when I was there between 1974-1977 the MVBC Campus in Bangs was all a-buzz. So, next time you drive out by the ol' place, do me a favor. Stop out front. Get out of your car, walk up to that ol' building and get down on one knee. Say a prayer, thanking God for the good years I had in that place. Then, look up to the gable window on the top floor just left of the tower, and imagine me and my bud's hanging out the window shooting bottle rockets out that window at fellow students down on the ground.</i></blockquote>
