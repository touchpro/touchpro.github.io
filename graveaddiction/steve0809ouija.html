On August 1, 2009 I received an e-mail from Steve about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It was summer time, last day of school is always a half day. I don't remember why we decided to do this, but we did. One of my friends, Cami, had a board, another friend, Nicki, told her to bring it and we'd go &quot;play&quot; with it. In the town I grew up in, there was this cave, if you will, in the side of a mountain I guess you could call it. Went back about 50 or so feet, little off shoots here and there. Usually used by the homeless. It was rumored that it was also used for Satanic rituals. At the entrance there were the words in red, &quot;Welcome to Hell.&quot;
<br><br>
Myself, Nicki, Cami, Tina (girlfriend at the time), and Cami's brother Ray were all present. We went into the cave and went to about the middle where there was a wood altar I guess, you could see where it would or could slide into the walls. We figured it was as good of a spot as any. So we settled down and lit some candles.
<br><br>
Nicki and I started out, we asked if anyone wanted to talk. The board sat still for a few, then slowly started to move. We asked who it was and it said &quot;Baby.&quot; Ok, odd enough...All of a sudden it started to move quicker, it said &quot;baby&quot; wasn't there anymore. We asked who we were speaking to, and it said &quot;Satan.&quot; Gets a little strange here (as if it wasn't strange enough to begin with).
<br><br>
Nicki's mom was into the Occult and had sacrificed her baby to Satan, and that was supposedly who we were speaking to before Satan took over. According to Satan, the spirit of &quot;baby&quot; bounces back and forth between me and Nicki. He wants the spirit, but can't get it because of us. Conversation went on for a little while longer, until we realized like 4 hours had passed and it seemed like nothing. We said we were going to go, but would get on later. Satan said that Nicki couldn't leave, but the rest of us could.  Well, it was odd enough, so I carried her out and we went back to my house. Ray had gone home. This comes into play in a minute.
<br><br>
Oh gotta mention, when we were in the cave these white spiders kept showing up on the walls. They wouldn't burn, they just appeared...It was creepy. I went back 10 years later...no spiders.
<br><br>
We got back to my place, got back on the board, and said &quot;Hello.&quot; To which the board responded back, we asked how he was doing to which he replied &quot;evil,&quot; then went to H A H A H A.  We couldn't figure out what it was doing, then it hit us he was laughing, least he had a sense of humor. Then it said &quot;1 down 3 to go.&quot; We freaked and got on the phone trying to get ahold of Ray.  We couldn't. Luckily he showed up a bit later.
<br><br>
Anyway, the board didn't like me...it was scared of me.  It didn't like Cami because he didn't want competition in the evil dept...made me laugh because she was an ex of mine. Didn't like Tina because she came between me and Nicki.  And it didn't really have an opinion on Ray. The board called him Ray Ray, which he hates. He flipped it off once, and the pointer flew from our fingers to NO. Once we saw him flip the board off, the next time we were talking and mid sentence it flew to NO we asked Ray if he flipped it off.  He said yes, so that explained that.
<br><br>
It threatened me by saying to be careful or he would get my mom. I got PISSED and threw the board across the room. When we got back on, &quot;Satan&quot; was laughing and called me an a$$hole.
<br><br>
The speed in which this thing was moving, there was no WAY myself or Nicki could have done it...it was wild!! Whether the story that the board was telling was true or not, or even if we were really talking to Satan himself, it was still pretty freaky.
<br><br>
Somehow the board ended up in the trunk of my car. That car never was the same. When on cruise control, it'd speed up and slow down on it's own.  The speakers would just SCREECH every so often, and would do so until I yelled knock it off. A dash light that is supposed to indicate a code from the computer kept flashing. When I went to check the code, it was a code that didn't exist, even the dealer couldn't find it in their books or their computers. The car was just not the same.
