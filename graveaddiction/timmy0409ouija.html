On April 2, 2009 I received an e-mail from Timmy about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Timmy, from southern California, and I just thought I would share my story.  I personally think its kinda interesting.
<br><br>
A group of my friends and I were over at my friend Brian's house watching a UFC fight, when the topic of the Ouija board came up. Brian said he had one, and I always wanted to try it so we did. We took it upstairs and we weren't getting much feedback, so I went downstairs and asked Brian's mom to try because apparently she's good at it.  After a little, it started working.  We took turns asking this person questions. This is what we found out about this person...
<br><br>
- His name is Dylan<br>
- He died at the age of six<br>
- His sister killed him with an axe when she was nineteen (freakiest part of the night)<br>
- His parents were with him<br>
- He was on the bed right by us<br>
<br><br>
Now whether or not this was true, I still thought it was pretty cool that a six year old came down to talk to us.  He also said that there was no heaven or hell, but God was preventing Brian's grandfather from talking to us.
<br><br>
Another thing that peaked my interest is the fact that this kid knew about the future. He predicted that I was going to make it home 5 minutes late from my curfew (which I did), and that I was going to get in trouble as a result. My dad said I was indeed in trouble, but since this happened last night, I don't know if I really am or not.
<br><br>
Regardless, I completely believe in the Ouija board.  It's kinda creepy, but very fun.
