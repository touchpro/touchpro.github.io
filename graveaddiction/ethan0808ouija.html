On August 12, 2008 I received an e-mail from Ethan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have always been fascinated by the supernatural and the like. It had never occured to me that I could make my own ouija board! After going through this site and reading all of the tips and advice and such last night, I decided to make my own ouija board out of paper and a sharpie. For the oracle, I used a playing card with the ace of spades and cut a hole inside the ace so that it could accurately show what letter. I decided to first try it with my friend Kenny because I felt that he'd be the one to take it the most serious.
<br><br>
We lit incense and a candle and sat on the floor with our board on the table between us.  Almost immediately it began to move. We channeled the spirit of a 32 year old man named Deurg who died in the year 3 B.C. Imagine our surprise!!
<br><br>
We asked him how he died, and he said &quot;FW.&quot; We were confused, so I asked &quot;Um...Deurg...did you die by fireworks??&quot;  He moved the cursor to no. I asked him again how he died, and he said murder.  Turns out that he was murdered, but doesn't know who killed him. Poor Deurg.
<br><br>
We asked him if he was married, and he said no. We asked him if he had a girlfriend, and he said no, but he was in love with a woman named Torae. When we began to ask him things about her, he moved the cursor to goodbye.  After that we paused for a smoke break and began talking about spirit guides.
<br><br>
When we came back, we asked if we had upset him and he said yes, so we apologized to him and he said he forgave us.  We asked Deurg if he was a good spirit, and he said yes. We asked him if there were evil spirits in the house, and he said yes. We asked if they could hurt us, and he said yes.  He also replied yes when we asked if he would protect us from the evil spirits, and if he COULD protect us from them.
I asked if he was my spirit guide, and he said yes.  To test him, I asked him my name and he didn't know. So when I asked him again, he said no. I asked if he was Kenny's spirit guide, and he said yes.
<br><br>
When I asked him the name of Kenny's spirit guide, he began to spell his own name. We began asking him things about Kenny (i.e. how old Kenny is, what year he was born, the color of his eyes, what he handled on his job, etc).  Deurg got it all right.  We asked him if he had to warn Kenny about anything, and he said no. We also asked him if Kenny had anything that he needed to be careful of, and he said no.  So I patted Kenny on the shoulder and said &quot;Ha, good for you man.&quot;
<br><br>
Deurg started moving the cursor slower and slower, so we asked if he was tired. Then the cursor stopped moving all together and didn't continue. So we said our goodbyes and flipped the board.
<br><br>
I like Deurg. He's very kind, and I feel safe and comfortable talking to him. Ha, I'm sure Kenny feels even better about him! Imagine finding your spirit guide the first time you ever use the board!!  I'm very anxious to talk to Deurg again, and hopefully I'll be able to make contact tomorrow when I have someone else to operate the board with me. Maybe Kenny will come over.  With any luck, I'll be able to contact my spirit guide too! I'm very anxious.
<br><br>
I'll admit I had my slight fears about using the board in the beginning, but now I love it!!!
