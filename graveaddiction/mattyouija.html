On June 21, 2005 I received an e-mail from Matty about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This is so aweing that I do not even no where to begin. I have always thought there was a world beyond what we see, and that people are narrowminded to the facts of what exist. My story begins when my father passed away. I always wanted to contact him again. So I got a board. At the time I was so naive, but I learned. The first time me and my friends used it we had contacted an evil spirit. He calls himself Ed or Ekcard, he took on the character of a demoned angel. He still trys to pester me and my friends, but I have built a safety net in which he can't break. 
<br><br> 
After reading more about the board, I made my own and decided to contact my father. It worked from that day on, till now I have not stopped talking to him. When I talk to him, I pray over the board, use a pure silver cross, or the Bible as protection. Through him he has helped me in my life even though he has passed on. He has helped me find things, he has saved my nephew from getting injured. He has told me about other things in general that I ask. To me my father isn't dead - he is more alive than ever, and where he is there is light and happiness. Once he commented to me, &quot;I don't worry about you because you are cared for by God...There are no tears in heaven.&quot;
<br><br> 
Are you happy I asked: &quot;Yes&quot;
<br><br> 
What do angels look like? &quot;Like little Blue Butterflies.&quot; 
<br><br> 
My Mother thinks that I am going through a phase, but I am not. The way my father explained it to me is that he is allowed to help people, however he doesn't know everything; only God does, and only God can guide you all the way. So right now my father is helping me through a big big big thing - trying to get the man of my dreams. lol! He gives me advice, and if he sees something he lets me know and I make a decision on what to do.&quot;
