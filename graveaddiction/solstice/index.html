So today is the big surprise day at work.  I have no idea what this "big surprise" is, but my boss has been making a huge deal out of it for the last 2 weeks.  All I know is that we find out at 1:45 today.  I think we're going to see Spiderman 2.  I guess we'll see.  It would be pretty interesting to see it with my co-workers.<br /><br />I dropped Cordy off at the groomers this morning.  She needs to get a Summer cut.  Her hair is getting knotty & she's starting to stink.  She loves going to the groomer/vet's.  People always fuss over her.  She is such an attention hound.<br /><br />Speaking of Spiderman 2, I'm babysitting tonight for Joey's little Brother, so Joey can go see Spiderman 2 with his parents.  He's very, very excited.  By the way he was acting, you would think it's Christmas or something.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to next weekend as well.  It's the big Moundsville ghost hunt.  I can't wait!  I haven't been on an actual ghost hunt since last Fall when I went to Prospect Place with Beth.<br /><br />Well, I should get back to work.  Only a few more hours until the "big surprise" :)<br /><br /><br><br>

Hum, what to blog about today....  You know, nothing interesting is happening.  I got home from the gym yesterday, made myself dinner, cleaned, watched some movie & went to bed.  Pretty uneventful, but relaxing.<br /><br />I just had some fun drama with a new tablet pc.  It was supposed to be shipped to me UPS overnight, but for some reason it was shipped to me US Mail.  I have no idea why they did that.  I wonder if they even insured it.<br /><br />Only 3 more days until my 4 day weekend!  <br><br>

And it's Monday again, yuck!  I am looking forward to this weekend, I'm going to have 4 days off.  How exciting!  I have all kinds of fun stuff planned.  Lots of sleeping & drinking :)  Well, other stuff as well.  Like fireworks, cooking out, meeting up with friends.  It'll be a lot of fun.<br /><br />Last night was exhausting!  Joey's 4th birthday involved a ton of sugar high kids running around acting like crazy people.  Joey had a blast!  He got so many Spider Man toys.  His last present from his parents is getting to see Spider Man on opening night.  I'll get to babysit his Brother that night.<br /><br />Tonight I don't think I have anything planned.  Maybe I'll just clean & watch some TV.  Oh, I did buy Secondhand Lions this weekend.  I love that movie.  It is such a great story!  I think that's all the excitement for right now :)<br><br>

What a great weekend so far!  Friday I hung out with James & cooked dinner & rented the Secret Window.  Anything with Johnny Depp has to be good!  Well, maybe not good, but at least there's eye candy.<br /><br />Sat I went to the Strawberry Festival in London OH.  It was a lot of fun.  I got to eat my favorite, cheese on a stick.  It's so tasty, but so bad for you.  I was a little disappointed in the Strawberries, turned out they were from California.<br /><br />Sat night I watched "Saved".  It was a pretty funny movie.  I recommend watching it.  I still need to watch the new Michael Moore movie, which I hope to do sometime this week.<br /><br />I'm going to be heading over to Jenny's house soon for Joey's 4th birthday.  I can't believe he's already 4!  I remember when he was born.  He's having a "Spider Man birthday", so he is very excited.  Well, gotta go check on my laundry :)<br><br>

This is a late blog, but it's been really busy today!  Last night was sooo much fun!  Beth came over and we decided to find this cemetery we had been unable to find before.  So we followed her directions in her cemetery book.  We found the general area that it was supposed to be in, but we couldn't see it.  We had to walk though a field, which of course I hadn't been prepared for, and had worn sandals.  We saw some guy in the distance with his dog, we assumed we were on his land, and decided to ask him if he knew where the cemetery was.  I've found that in most situations people can be helpful.  He not only told us where it was, but took us there.  He had the cutest dog named Max, who helped lead the way.  We had to hike up an overgrown path with ticks and mosquitoes, oh my.  I only lost my sandal's twice, so it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />We finally got to the cemetery, and I'll tell you what, it was worth the hike.  Beth got some great pictures and put them on her website.  I'm horrible at putting links in blogs, so just go to graveaddiction.com.  As we walked down the hill a rainstorm started, at least it's Summer, and the rain wasn't too cold.<br /><br />After that we went to a bar close to Rob's (guy who assisted us) house.  He told us some other great places to go to.  Then Beth & I went to our favorite Mexican restaurant and stuffed ourselves on Mexican food.  I was so tired when I got home, I went straight to bed, and even woke up late for work.  Oh well, it was a great night!<br><br>

Yesterday was a pretty good day.  After work I went home and made myself dinner.  I made spaghetti with meatless meatballs.  It was quite tasty, and I am looking forward to my leftovers in about an hour.<br /><br />I ended up cleaning and pulling weeds.  Sounds like a blast, eh?  Cordy was being a bad puppy last night.  I had to put the muzzle on her because she would not stop barking!  They were paving the drive behind my condo, and she was barking her fool head off at the workers.  Sometimes she just can't contain herself!<br /><br />I also watched Law & Order last night.  I love that show.  Right now it's basically the only show I'm watching.  Well, that, and Crossing Jordan.  Over the Winter I was a tv junkie.  Now I'm trying to wean myself off of it.<br /><br />I am so happy that I only have one more day until Friday.  It's almost the weekend!  I am really looking forward to the 4th of July weekend.  I'll have 4 days off.  I always have to watch Return of the Living Dead during the 4th of July weekend buddy boy :)  Do you know why Dave?????<br><br>

Well, I saw the Terminal last night.  It was a pretty decent movie.  The thing that cracked me up is I was sitting there watching the movie & I love men with accents.  I was thinking the main character was kinda sexy with the accent.  Then I suddenly realized, it was TOM HANKS.  The sad part is I knew it was him, but I got so into the movie, that I was thinking he was sexy.  EWWW!!!!  It was very disturbing for me.  No offense to any Tom Hanks fans out there.<br /><br />Tonight should be pretty chill.  I don't have any plans.  I think I might just clean :)  I've been so obsessed with cleaning lately, and I don't know why.  Maybe I'll give Cordy a bath.  Giving her a bath is always an experience, because she fights it.  After about the 1st half of her bath she gives up, and just stands there & pouts.<br /><br />Oh well, tomorrow should be fun.  It's Mexican food & a cemetery with Beth.  I'm sure we both already know exactly what we're going to get :)  It'll be fun to check out a new cemetery as well.  Gotta get back to work :)<br><br>
