Now I am so excited!  We're closing at 2 today!  Nice way to start a 3-day weekend!  Only 2 1/2 more hours.<br /><br />Last night was a lot of fun.  My old Professor was having a lecture at the Newark library on the D-Day invasion.  So I drove out there last night & met up with my friend Deb (who was a History major with me & had classes with this Prof as well).  It was such a flashback to college.  I forgot how much Dr. Ganz can talk!  It was great though!  Dr. Ganz is why I became a History major in the first place.  The lecture lasted for about 2 hours & then Deb & I went out to eat at Applebees in Heath.<br /><br />We talked about seeing Supersize Me next week.  It looks like a good movie!  It's only showing at the Drexel in Bexley, so she's have to drive up here.<br /><br />Well, I'm going to have to keep this short, I have a bunch of things I need to finish before I can leave at 2:00  :)<br /><br />Have a great Memorial Day weekend, and don't forget the meaning behind it!<br><br>

Any old L7 fans out there.  For some reason this song is going through my head this morning so I had to look up the lyrics & post them:<br /><br /> L7 - THE BOMB (from their 1994 album, Hungry for Stink)<br /><br />Plastic people with their plastic lives <br />Plastic lips tell plastic lies <br />Plastic drivers in plastic cars <br />Plastic food from plastic jars <br /><br />Frustration is the fuse <br />The flame is hate <br />Tick tick tick <br />Detonate <br />She`s the bomb <br /><br />Plastic models in plastic magazines <br />Plastic kings and plastic queens <br />All are seen on plastic TVs <br />Prayed to by people on bended plastic knees <br /><br />What you think, well that`s good too <br />But not as much as what do you do <br />This fuse burns slow <br />Waiting to blow <br />The world is a heavy load <br />Watch it explode<br /><br />Lawmakers with plastic policies <br />Put plastic locks on their cities <br />In hopes to keep them quiet <br />Well go off <br />Well blow up <br /><br><br>

I'll bet my neighbors think I'm crazy!  Last night I was supposed to babysit, but Jenny's Sister-in-Law went into labor, so I ended up not having any plans.  I went to CVS to refill my prescription for Allegra, and they charged me $45!  How stupid is that?  The insurance company raised it because they want me to use Claritan now because it's available over the counter.  However, Claritain does not work as well for me as Allegra does.  Stupid insurance companies!<br /><br />I opened my last bottle of Vampire Merlot (which you can buy from World Market during Halloween)last night.  I drank quite a bit and decided to have a cleaning orgy.  It was great, but to come back to my opening line of my blog, I was pulling weeds in my front yard last night about 9:30, and I got some of the strangest looks.  At least I didn't shout at them or anything, then I would be known as the crazy, drunk lady at the end of the street :)<br /><br />Well, it's time for lunch....<br><br>

What a day, what a day!  You know, sometimes I get so sick and tired of all the hypocrites in this world!  Why can't people just be truthful to themselves and others.  I hate these phony facades that people put on.  It's enough to make me sick sometimes.  They're all nice and friendly to your face, and then talk shit as soon as your back is turned.  Sometimes you overhear people you think are your "friends" talking about you, and it's a real wake up call that you can't trust people.  Many people will just use you to get what they want, and then throw you away when they're done.  It's hard to find people to trust, people to be your friends.  Sometimes I just want to hide from the world and all this "fake" crap that people consider reality.  Why do I have to be the "different" one?  I'm sure there are many other people in this world who have the same ideals & values as I do, but hide behind what other people consider to be "normal".  What is normal?  Is it the homeless person on the street corner, the child molester in jail, the high profile businessman who cheats on his wife when he is on a business trip?  Who is to judge what is normal, when no one out there is pure?  You should be judged on the good you do for the world, not how much money you make, or how many things you sell for your company.  It's the hypocrites in this world that wear down the good people, until they are reduced to the type of person they never wanted to be.  But I will continue to be the person that I want to be, no matter who tells me I should be what others want me to be.  Ok, I think I feel better now....<br><br>

We had some crazy storms Friday night.  They were really cool to watch because the thunder & lightening was unbelievable!  Cordy refused to go outside until after the storm was over.  For only being 9 lbs she's pretty good at not doing what I want her to.  I physically put her outside, and she cowered in the corner trying not to get wet.  It was funny, in a cruel type of way.<br /><br />Friday night I went out to eat at Bravo.  That was quite a tasty place.  It's making me hungry again just thinking about it.  I also watched Fulci's the Beyond again just for fun.<br /><br />Sat I ended up shopping around a bit.  I was supposed to go to a birthday party for Erin's dog, but Erin ended up suffering from a sinus infection.  I went to Jenny's to hang out.  We went and got ice cream.  I am always amazed at how much ice cream a kid can get on himself.  Nathan had ice cream everywhere, even his feet!<br /><br />Sunday was the typical parents day.  They did put their hammock outside, so I laid on that and watched the clouds.  It was very relaxing.  I wish I was doing that right now instead of working :(<br /><br><br>

Yesterday was a lot of fun.  I left work early, and went to the hospital to see Amanda & her new baby, Colton.  Her husband is from Texas, hence the Texan sounding name.  Amanda is doing well, just very tired.<br /><br />After that I headed over to Jenny's to go out for her birthday.  It was me, Jenny, her husband & Audra.  We went to the Funny Bone.  First we ate dinner, I spent $30, which is pretty darned expensive!  It was ok.  The comedy was great.  The headliner was Gabriel Iglesias.  I think he's going to be there for the rest of the week, so I strongly recommend going.  Also, check out the website www.latinostandup.com.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do this weekend.  I don't have any solid plans.  Gotta get back to work :)  TGIF!!!!!<br><br>

Yesterday I actually took a sick day, so hence, no post.  I finally went to the Dr yesterday to discuss some problems I've been having lately.  Mainly how easily I've been bruising.  I have some very ugly looking bruises on my body, it looks like someone has been beating me up.  So they ran some tests, and today I had some blood drawn.  I'm thinking I'm anemic.  I guess I'll find out Monday when I get the results.<br /><br />On a more positive note, my friend Amanda had her baby last night.  She went into labor about 8:30 yesterday morning.  She had a bouncing baby boy at 9:15 last night. Long labor!  I'm leaving work early today so I can go visit her & the new baby.<br /><br />Tonight I'm also going out for Jenny's b-day.  She was 28 yesterday, how scary!  I did end up getting her a Frank's gift card, I'm sure she'll love it!<br /><br />Beth's birthday was also yesterday.  Wow, a quarter of a century old!  I think it's so weird, now I know 3 people born on May 19th, what a coincidence!<br /><br />Well, I need to get back to work since I'm getting off work early :)<br><br>

The sky is starting to look omnious, I think it's going to storm again.  It was fun watching the storm last night.  Cordy was freakin' out, she wasn't sure how to deal with thunder.  I'm super busy at work today, I have an evaluation I have to work on, so I will be keeping this short.<br /><br />Last night after the gym I went to Target.  Joey's b-day is coming up soon, and I just had to buy him some Teenage mutant Ninja Turtle pj's.  They are so cute!  TMNT were around when I was younger, and I guess they still are.  I wonder when the cartoon is on, I'd like to check it out sometime.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot the interesting thing that happened last night.  So I'm sitting on the couch watching TV, and I have the window open so I could listen to the thunder & rain.  I see a cop car pull up in front of my condo, and he shines the spotlight right into my window.  I'm like great, what's going on.  He opens the door & gets out, but because it's so dark I can't see him.  I grabbed Cordy and opened the door.  Only then did I notice that he was at the neighbors condo (which is empty) with a black girl (about 15-20, I'm bad with judging people's ages).  She's trying to tell the cop that she lives there.  The cop turns around and asks me, "have you ever seen this girl before, she says she lives here."  Since I know the new owner is a single white male that is not planning on moving in until next month, I told the officer that nobody was living there right now.  So he shines the flashlight in the window, notices it's empty, and says to the girl, "what are you trying to pull on me?"  I go inside after this because I don't need to see the drama, but I do notice that he leaves about 2 minutes later.  I don't notice if he has the girl with her or not.  It was all very interesting!<br><br>

Let's see, it's Monday again, and that means back to work.  This weekend seemed pretty long to me, which is probably because I actually woke up pretty early on Sat & Sun.  Of course, pretty early for me on the weekends means 9:30-10.<br /><br />Friday night I hung out with James & we saw Van Helsing.  Sigh, I was hoping Van Helsing would be good, no such luck.  I thought it sucked pretty badly.  I wasn't very happy about it, but what's a girl to do?<br /><br />Sat I was planning on weeding the garden.  However, it decided to pour down rain all day long.  I ended up cleaning my condo for the first 1/2 of the day.  Then I went & hung out with Amanda, Jenny & the boys.  Amanda's due date was yesterday, still no baby.  I feel so bad for her, she seems so uncomfortable!  Jenny ended up making us all dinner.  Good stuff!<br /><br />Sunday I went to my parents house & did a ton of laundry.  When I got home I planted a few more plants and weeded the garden.<br /><br />Tonight I really need to go shopping.  Jenny's birthday is coming up, and I need to get her something.  I'm not really sure what.  Maybe a gift card from Franks or something.<br /><br />Oh, and my friend Dave called this weekend.  I didn't get a chance to call him back yet.  He had served in Iraq for over a year.  We had an awkward encounter when he came back, we'll just leave it at that.  Anyways, I haven't talked to him since then, and it's been about 2 months.  I really need to either call him back, or e-mail him.  Hopefully it won't be awkward.<br /><br />Well, that's my exciting life for right now, back to work I go :)<br><br>

TGIF!!!!  Only 3 more hours until freedom from corporate hell!!!  Awww, I love the weekends!  Last night I finally went to Franks and bought some flowers.  My yard is really starting to shape up.  All I need to do now is buy some mulch.  I'm not sure how exciting this weekend is going to be yet.  It depends on what I decide to do.  One thing I really enjoy about not being tied down is that my time is my own.  I could lay on the couch all weekend if I wanted to.  I was hoping to go to a flea market this weekend, but Beth shot that plan all to hell :(  I guess I'll just have to wait till next month (just kidding Beth, it's AOK)  I wonder if my friend is going to have her baby this week, she's due May 16, it could be a crazy weekend :)<br><br>

It's official, I'm going to Florida, I'm going to Florida!!!!!!  I just bought my airline tickets today.  I haven't been to Florida for 2 years.  My cousin lives in Tampa, so I'm going to stay with her.  I can't wait, it'll be so much fun, a real vacation!<br /><br />On a more gloomy note, I found out where the water was coming from in my condo.  I guess they had a water main break a condo over.  Nice, eh.  So I spent last night trying to soak up the water with newspaper, yuck!  Oh well, I think I'm going to spend the whole night cleaning.  Get everything put back together.  Maybe even make a stop at Franks.<br /><br />So last night I also stopped by my Aunt's house.  She's on vacation in Utah and needed me to feed her birds & squirrels for her.  I think she's a tab obsessive about her animals.  She has 7 birdfeeders & feeds the squirrels peanuts.  The birds were waiting in the trees for me to finish filling their feeders, it was a tad creepy.  She also had 2 birdbaths I had to clean & fill up.<br /><br />Well, I should get back to work :)<br /><br />  <br><br>

What an exhausting day!  Not only did I get to bed late, but I have yet another issue with my condo.  I got home from babysitting last night, and I'm laying on the couch while Cordy is running around playing.  She comes onto the couch to lay next to me, and her paws are wet.  So I'm wondering how in the world her paws got wet.  I look around my place, and notice that the carpet behind the sofa is wet.  No idea where the hell this water came from, and I have no idea what to do.  It's not coming from the ceilings, or walls, and my place is on a concrete slab, so I have absolutely no idea what is going on.  I guess I have to call my Dad.  I hate doing it though because he was just over last week putting my new dishwasher in.<br /><br />I had to train a new person this morning.  Always fun (she says sarcastically).  I wasn't able to check my e-mail or anything, talk about withdrawal.<br /><br />Tonight I have some major cleaning to do.  I also have to go to the store.  It should be a busy night, but hopefully I'll be able to get some things done.<br><br>

Yawn!  I'm tired today!  Last night was fun.  I went over to Beth's about 6.  We ended up going to Baja Fresh and gorged ourselves on Mexican food.  Then we hit two new cemeteries in Grovetucky (Grove City).  After we got to Beth's house we did the ouija board for a little while.  Talk about creeping me out!  We were talking to this one spirit who told me that I had to watch my back basically, that someone had screwed me over once & they were going to do it again.  Nice, I love it when people do that to me.  After that Mark came over & we all watched Family Plots.  The 1st episode was new, the 2nd was a repeat.<br /><br />After I got home I was going to go to bed, but Cordy was in one of her psycho hyper moods.  Not wanting to calm down, she ran back & forth, back & forth.  Ran up to the door and starting barking, ran to the other door and started barking.  Finally I took her outside for a little walk.  Finally she was calmed down & ready for bed.  I finally got to sleep about 12:30, which is late for me on a work night.<br /><br />Tonight is babysitting night.  Tomorrow I'm helping to throw a baby shower & two wedding showers for some people I work with.  It should be fun.  Hopefully I'll have time to go to the store tomorrow night, because I am getting very low on food.<br /><br />I have had no time to myself lately, which is driving me crazy.  I love spending time alone in my own solitude.  My place really needs to be cleaned, I have to go to Franks and buy some more plants, and go to the store to buy food.  Hopefully I'll be able to work on those things Wednesday & Thursday nights.<br /><br />Oh, I backordered the new Laurell K. Hamilton book on Amazon.  It's call Cravings Anthology.  It has a short story by her, and by 3 other authors.  Looks like it should be good.  As always I highly recommend checking it out.<br /><br />My coworker just brought her little girl in.  She's 4 months old, and such a cutie.  I want to pick her up and give her hugs, but she has to stay in her stroller or she'll start crying.  Oh well, I guess I'll have plenty time with kids tonight.<br /><br />I also found out the Nekromantix are going to be playing in Cleveland.  I am very tempted to go, but not sure who to go with.  I know my Brother likes the band, but I'm not sure if he'd go all the way to Cleveland with me.  Guess I'll have to think about it.<br /><br />Time to get back to work :)<br><br>

Well, it's another lovely Monday morning.  At least the sun is shining!  We had a beautiful weekend!  Friday night I saw a Reds game.  Yes, I actually like baseball.  When I was in grade school I played for 7 years.  It was a good time.<br /><br />Sat I went to Frank's and bought my Mom (& myself) a hanging fushia plant.  I always buy her a hanging fushia basket & her's always looks beautiful, but mine dies mid summer.  I guess I don't water them enough.<br /><br />Sat night I went to a party for my friend.  We didn't end up getting there until the end, when there were only about 10 people there.  It was still fun though, I hadn't seen many of those people for quite a while.<br /><br />Sunday was Mother's Day, so I went over to my parents house.  Cordy & Maggie had a blast playing in the backyard.  Both puppies were exhausted by the time they were finished playing.  My Brother & I started to cook dinner for Mom.  However, she doesn't like anyone in her kitchen, and kicked us out.  She ended up cooking most of the dinner herself, but we tried to help.<br /><br />I also dug up some lilies of the valley & hostos at my parents house last night.  I ended up planting them at my place when it was almost dark outside.  I still have to go to Frank's to buy some Impatiens, Wave Petunias, and mulch.  I think that's all I need.<br /><br />Tonight should be fun.  I'm going to get together with Beth.  I think we're going to eat at Baja Fresh & then check out a cemetery or two, and watch Family Plots.  I think she's also wanting to play with the Ouija, because I guess people want to read more Ouija stories on her website.<br /><br />Well, gotta get back to work, it's Monday & it's busy :)<br /><br /><br><br>

I feel the need to blog early today since Beth really built the Margarita story up!<br /><br />So last night Beth came over.  Cordy was pissed because Beth had too much stuff in her hands to play with her right away.  Cordy later expressed her feelings by stealing one of the new pens Beth gave me & destroying it in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />We ended up going to a few cemeteries that Beth had maps to.  We found 3 out of 4, which wasn't bad at all.  I think the missing one was moved because some new houses were built there.<br /><br />We ended up at the Mexican restaurant about 8:45.  I went to the restroom as soon as we got there.  Beth knew I wanted a margarita, but didn't know what size, so she ordered me a medium.  I had actually wanted a large, and the waiter decided that if I finished the medium I had, he would bring me another, and if I finished it, he would give it to me for free.  I was like, cool, 2 margaritas is a piece of cake.  <br /><br />So I ordered my typical veggie meal: cheese quesadilla, cheese enchilada, and bean burrito.  I finished my 1st margarita before my meal came.  The waiter brought me my 2nd one, which was freakin' huge!  But still, I was like, no big deal.  So I took my first sip, and hum, it was a lot stronger than usual.  They must have added a few extra shots of tequila, because after a few big sips, I was feeling it.  So I made Beth chug some margarita.  Beth started feeling the tequila as well.  The waiter was trying to get us drunk!  He did a pretty good job, I was pretty buzzed by the time we left.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing!  He didn't charge us for it, so that was cool.  There are certain perks of being a regular at certain restaurants, mine is free margaritas!!!!<br /><br />Thanks Beth for trying to help me finish the margarita and for hanging out with me!  I had a great time!<br /><br />After I got home I had to watch Angel.  I really don't like the show Angel, but I have to watch it because Spike is on it.  He is one fine man.  Love the fake accent ;)  <br /><br />Well, gotta get back to work.  Only 7 hours until the weekend :)<br><br>

I thought I might as well do this....<br /><br />3x Thursday: 05/06/y2k+4: Your Qwirky Self <br /><br />1. What have you done this week to better yourself?<br /><br />I went to the Doctor's and finally got some Algeria.<br /><br />2. Describe something you did this week that was goofy/dumb.<br /><br />Thinking that a one year old knew how to use a slide (please note post from earlier)<br /><br />3. Everyone has conflict. Weather it's with a roommate, S.O, or plain just not wanting to get out of bed. Name and describe one conflict you've had this week. What did you do about it? Is it solved?<br /><br />Well, I just got off the phone with my Dad.  Now I love my Dad very, very much, but sometimes he can be a little too pissy.  I called my house to talk to my Dad and see how installing my dishwasher was coming along.  First thing he says is, "how in the world am I supposed to work with some many Goddamn vases in the way?"  I didn't know that he had to go under the sink so I didn't clean it out.  When my Dad is in a mood like that, there's no talking to him, so I said I guess I'll just have to throw them away.  Oh well, I guess I didn't need that many vases.  I made sure to thank him before I got off the phone for putting in my dishwasher.  I hope he's calmed down by now.<br /><br /><br />Bonus Question for Comments: Think of your biggest problem in your life at the moment (describing what it is, is optional). In the grand scheme of things, does it matter? Will it affect you down the road?<br /><br />Well, I have quite a bit of debt.  I'm not too thrilled about it, and it tends to stress me out from time to time.  I guess I'll just have to marry a rich man so he can pay off my debt (that was said sarcastically, well, mostly).<br /><br><br>

Well, the Doctor's was a success!  I was right about what was wrong with me as well.  Sinus infection & Allgeries, great combo.  At least he gave me free samples of Algeria, so I don't have to fill that one for a while.<br /><br />Last night I babysat for the boys.  We had a pretty good time.  We went to the school across the street and played on the playground.  Nathan (the one year old) only hurt himself twice.  One time he was getting ready to go down a slide.  For some reason I thought he knew how to slide, instead he starts to walk down the slide & starts to tumble.  I caught him before he got too far though.  At least kids are rubbery!  The second time he was running and was looking back at me smiling, and whack, ran right into a tree.  Crazy kid!  Oh well, at least they seemed to have fun.<br /><br />Tonight I'm hanging out with Beth.  It should be a good time, dinner & a cemetery.  I'm also going to have Beth take some new pictures of Cordy & put them on my blog.<br><br>

Well, the evil hives are back.  Last night was the absolute worst!  I started getting the hives again in the evening.  By the time I went to bed I was starting to get a headache.  I woke up about 12:30 with a killer headache & hives all over my legs!  My headache was making me sick to my stomach, and I was seriously considering going to the emergency room.  I finally got back to sleep about 2.  When I woke up my headache & hives were gone.  How weird is that?  I made an appt to see the Dr. this afternoon.  My own personal diagnosis is that I have a sinus infection & my allgeries are acting up.  So he'll probably give me two prescriptions, which will cost $50 with my insurance.  Another $50 I don't have!  Oh well, it has to be done.<br /><br />I dropped Cordy off at the groomers this morning.  For some reason she is always very excited to go there.  I think she likes the attention.  She is such a wiggle worm though, I wonder how they cut her fur?  <br /><br />Tonight, if I feel ok, I'm going to babysit.  Hopefully the boys will be on their best behavior.  Thursday night is graveyard & Mexican food night.  I am already looking forward to dinner (I'll bet Beth is too).  Well, I gotta get back to work.  I have some things I have to finish before I can leave for my Dr.'s appt.<br><br>

Tuesday Twosome:<br /><br /> Reading<br /><br />1. Do you prefer: Fiction or non-fiction?<br /><br />I actually like to read both.  Being a history major, I love to read books about history, but then I'm also a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan!<br /><br />2. Do you prefer: Magazines or books?<br /><br />Books<br /><br />3. Do you prefer: Biography or autobiography?<br /><br />I like biography.  I think it's more interesting & more fairly written.<br /><br />4. Name your two favorite books:<br /><br />Well, all Laurell K. Hamilton books, and I'll pick as a non-fiction book Into That Darkness : An Examination of Conscience<br />by Gitta Sereny, which is a very good, but depressing book about the commandant of Treblinka, Franz Stangl.<br /><br />5. Name two books you haven't read, but plan to:<br /><br />The DaVinci Code & the new Laurell K. Hamilton book that is due out in October :)<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ahhh, no more itching or scratching today.  The hives were gone by the time I woke up this morning.  Sweet relief!  Today, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, what a beautiful day!  Last night was a pretty good night.  I was doped up on the couch (on Benedryl) watching Family Plots.  The 2nd episode was a repeat, but the 1st one was new.  Gotta get back to work :)<br /><br /><br /><br />  <br><br>

I swear I am going to start scratching my skin off!!!  I am having a major issue with hives right now.  I have a lot of allergies, and I must have eaten something I shouldn't and now I have hives everywhere.  Agh, I'm going to start screaming!!!!!!  This really, really sucks!!!!!  I thought I'd write something here because I think my co-workers are getting tired of hearing me bitch.<br /><br />This was a pretty good weekend.  I saw Kill Bill 2 Friday, and I loved it.  Go ahead Dave, say I told you so :)  It was a really good movie.  There were a few parts that freaked me out (like the being buried alive scene).  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Sat I went dishwasher shopping.  I think I'm going to end up buying a Whirlpool.  It seems to be a pretty good dishwasher.  Sat night I hung out with my girlfriends.  We went to Don Pablos.<br /><br />I missed the Beltaine fes (sorry Jos, had to go dishwasher shopping).  I'm sure it was fun.  Sunday I went to my friend's babyshower.  She got a lot of pretty girl baby things.<br /><br />This week seems like it's going to be pretty busy.  I'm going to have to get together with Beth soon so we can check out some cemeteries.  The weather should be improving later this week.  I really have to start my gardening sometime soon.  Hanging baskets are on sale at Frank's (buy one, get one 1/2 off) this week.<br /><br />Sigh, I can't wait until I can go home and take some Benedryl, this madness has got to stop!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br><br>
