Well, it's "hump" day.  I took this Friday off work, so only one more day!  I am so sick of this rain, it's kinda depressing (and not in a good way).  Beth's back in town.  I'm looking forward to hearing all about her trip to New Orleans.  I'm sure she had a great time.<br /><br />Monday night I went out with my Aunt.  We went to a bunch of different stores (Steinmart, Burlington Coat Factory, and Filene's Basement) looking for a navy shell for her to wear under her suit.  Finally we found one, and it was only $10, which is pretty good.  We also went to Trader Joe's which is a great organic grocery store.<br /><br />Last night I went to the gym after work.  I was there for 2 hours!  It was a great workout!  When I finally got home Cordy was super excited to see me.  We made dinner and watched American Idol.  Once again I have to question myself, why do I watch this show?  I think I have some weird obsession with Simon Cowell.  Just something about British guys....<br /><br />I also watched Law & Order CSI.  It was such a weird show.  Basically some famous guy is accused of molesting children.  It was a Michael Jackson like story.  The actor even looked a little like Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Tonight I have to go to a Mary Kay party.  Why?  Because my best friend is throwing it, and I have to be supportive.  It should be interesting, and Jenny's making her famous salsa, so I can't complain too much.<br /><br /><br><br>

What's On your favorite 'recently viewed movies' list Right Now?<br /><br />Well this one isn't too exciting....<br /><br />My most recently viewed movies would include the "remake" of Dawn of the Dead.  I've also seen 50 First Dates (which is good), and Eurotrip (which sucked, Lucy Lawless couldn't even make it worth watching)<br><br>

Tuesday Twosome:<br /><br />Driving:<br /><br />1. Rain or Snow?<br /><br />I actually don't mind driving in the rain.  I just sold my car that had rear wheel drive, so hopefully I won't hate driving in the snow so much.<br /><br />2. Music from the radio or compact disc?<br /><br />Depends on my mood.  Alot of the music I listen to cannot be found on the radio.<br /><br />3. Yellow light: "slow down" or "go faster" ?<br /><br />Faster!<br /><br />4. Freeway or feeder road?<br /><br />Once again, depends on my mood.  If I don't need to be somewhere in a hurry, I'll go the feeder roads.<br /><br />5. Road Rage: "what's that?" or "Heck yeah, and you better not get in my way!"<br /><br />Yes, I can be road ragey.  I am usually a pretty calm driver, except when I'm late.<br /><br><br>

Monday Madness:<br /><br />1. Describe what you believe is a "good" driver.<br /><br />A good driver knows to get out of the fast lane if they're not going at least 10 over the speed limit.  Also, use turn signals, they're very important.<br /><br />2. Describe a "bad" driver (your opinion of course).<br /><br />A bad driver goes 55 on the freeway in the fast lane.  Drives me batty.  Also bad drivers weave in and out of traffic w/o using turn signals.  Bad drivers think they are the only person on the road.<br /><br />3. Which category do you fit in? Please back up your answer. Feel free to use examples!<br /><br />My Dad would consider me a bad driver.  I guess I go through brake pads too quickly.  He told me yesterday that the guy who bought my old car needed to replace the brake pads again.  However, I've been told I drive just like my Dad, like a bat out of hell.  I've tried to slow down and be a better driver lately.  I just recently got a new car, which I'm pretty happy about.  It makes me want to be a better driver ;)<br><br>

Sunday Brunch:<br /><br />More This and That:<br /><br />1. Are you organized or disorganized?<br /><br />I am organized in some ways, and disorganized in others.<br /><br />2. How well can you swim?<br /><br />I'm a pretty good swimmer.  I love the water, after all, I am a water sign.<br /><br />3. How often do you fill your gas tank?<br /><br />As often as needed.  Usually every week & a half, 2 weeks.<br /><br />4. Where is your favorite vacation spot?<br /><br />Either the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, or the Big Island of Hawaii.  Both are great for different reasons.<br /><br />5. What is you favorite animal to have as a pet?<br /><br />I have to say a dog because of their personalities.  Of course I love my pet bunny (Bella) and my fish.  I love all animals, but can't have cats because I'm allergic.<br><br>

Well, it's another Sunday, almost time to go back to work, YUCK!  I wish weekends were longer.  I had a pretty good weekend, except for the fact I have a nice cold going on.  Not sure where it came from, but now I'm dealing with it.<br /><br />Well, my date on Friday went pretty well.  I could not figure out what the hell to wear.  It was that inbetween temp and you're not sure what to wear.  I stood in front of the closet for a good 10 minutes.  My dog was of no help to me.  Sometimes I wish she could talk so I could get a second opinion on outfits.  Anyways, I settled on a short black skirt, and a white top.  I even got to wear sandals for the 1st time this year.<br /><br />Anyways, I met him at Easton.  We were to meet at the fountain in front of the Cheesecake Factory.  It was pouring rain of course.  At least I had an umbrella.<br /><br />So we went to Brio for dinner.  We had to wait for an hour & a half.  We ended up going to Adobe Gilas for a drink, and looked around in the stores a bit.<br /><br />Dinner was very tasty, and he insisted on paying, which was very nice (of course I didn't argue).  Then we went to Barnes & Noble and looked at some books (pretty exciting Friday night, eh).<br /><br />Since I had a few drinks at dinner I was pretty talkative.  I kept showing him my favorite authors (Laurel K. Hamilton & J.A. Jance).  Then I was looking at some tarot card books.  He asked if I was into that stuff, I said yes, and he was like, that's cool.  Point for him, at least he didn't call me a freak or weirdo, or give me one of those looks that I get from time to time.<br /><br />So he walked me to my car & then I drove him to his.  We sat in the car & talked for a bit.  Then he was getting ready to go, and there was that awkward moment of silence.  Then I start laughing.  Why do I do that?  I always laugh at a crutial time.  I was like, just give me a hug, I don't know you that well yet.  So I got a nice little hug.  And that was that, he wants to go out again sometime soon, and I was up for that.  No major sparkage, but you never know.<br /><br />Saturday I hung out with my girlfriends.  We ended up buying some wine and having a great gab fest.  Sometimes a girl just needs some quality time with her friends.  The four of us (Jenny, Amanda, Marian & I) are so close, it's like we're sisters.  I think we all trust each other with everything.  It's great :)<br /><br />Now I'm over at my parents doing laundry.  I'm going to have to leave soon to meet my Brother for dinner.  Cordy is a muddy mess, she's been playing in my parents backyard.  I just gave her a bath yesterday.  Guess I wasn't planning ahead.<br><br>

I haven't actually written a lot lately, looks like since Tuesday.  Since Beth is out the rest of this week, I have decided it is my duty to keep things interesting.<br /><br />So I have been trying to get a promotion at work, and have been working on this big project all week.  It was stressing me out, but now it is completed so I can relax.  Hopefully I'll get my 2nd interview sometime this week.<br /><br />Wednesday night I actually had a date.  It was kinda last minute.  I date this guy Rich every once in a while.  So he came over and brought me pizza, from Flying Pizza, which was quite tasty.  The we went and had some margaritas.  Which was all very nice.  He's a nice guy, but I'm not sure there's any spark there.  Then I think, maybe I'm just to picky.  Is it worse to be too picky and be single or to settle and be in an unhappy relationship?<br /><br />Anyways, so my dog gets jealous.  We were on the couch, you know, getting our groove on, and Cordy freaks out.  Starts barking and pawing at Rich.  Not the best behavior for a dog.  So, I think he hates my dog now.  I guess he should be happy she didn't bite him.  So I guess the question is, would you stop dating someone if there pet annoyed the crap out of you????<br /><br />So last night I went out with my Brother to Old Bag of Nails.  I love their fish & chips.  It was very tasty (and really fattening).  We had a couple of margaritas (see a pattern with my margaritas?) and talked about life.<br /><br />Today is Friday!  I'll actually be able to sleep in tomorrow.  I woke up this morning with a sore throat feeling all crappy.  I feel a little better now.  I have a date tonight with this guy named Jim.  It's our first date, so let's see how it goes.  I don't sound very positive about dating, do I?<br /><br />Well, I should get back to work.  Even though it's Friday, I still have work to do :)<br><br>

3x Thursday: These are just a few of my favorite things...<br /> <br />1. Who's your favorite person in your family? What makes them so cool? (note: family doesn't necessarily mean blood members)<br /><br />All my family members are my favorite for one reason or another.  If I had to pick one, I'd pick my Brother.  He's one of my best friends!<br /><br />2. What's your favorite meal of the day? Why?<br /><br />I love dinner/supper.  I'm usually at home & I get to relax.<br /><br />3. What's your favorite search engine? Can it cook your meals for you?<br /><br />Um, kinda weird question.  I usually use Yahoo.  As far as cooking meals, it would be nice if it could.<br /><br />Bonus Question for Comments: You're given one day to do any number of favorite things that you choose. What would your day consist of?<br /><br />Let's see...  I would be able to sleep in.  It would be a perfect Summer day, so I would head out to my Aunt's in the country, hang out at her pool, read.  Then I would eat lunch at Chipotle (yum!), and go for a hike in the Hocking Hills.  Then I would like to hang out with some friends, and go eat some Italian food somewhere.  Then maybe go to a club or just hang out.<br /><br><br>

Whatever Wednesdays:  (Thanks Beth for the idea)<br /><br />1. What are your views on pornography?<br /><br />Well, I don't have any real views on it.  Some people are really into it.  Me, I prefer a good story where I can use my imagination, if you know what I mean ;)<br /><br />2. What would you like done to your body when you die?<br /><br />I would like a nice little house built for me in the country.  I would like my body placed in the living room of that house, on a Lazyboy.  Sounds good to me.<br /><br />3. Would you rather eat your tongue or your hand?<br /><br />Hum, would this involve cutting off my tongue or hand first?  Or would I actually have to eat it off while it's still attached.  Would I win money for this?  I would rather not eat anything attached, but if I had to choose, it would be my left hand.<br /><br><br>

Awww, sweet Chipotle heaven....  I have been so hungry all day, and finally it was lunch time.  Now I'm sitting at my desk munching away on a burrito.<br /><br />Last night I went to Petsmart and spent about $100 on my dog.  I bought her a new bed, new doggie gate, shampoo, doggie perfume, and a couple of bones.  I thought she really needed a new bed.  Her old one doesn't have a lot of padding, and she folds it up & perches on the top of it.  She didn't look very comfortable.  So this new bed was all fleecy (is that a word?) and soft & squishy.  I thought she'd love it.  So last night I put it in her cage and go to bed.  I check on her a few minutes later and she's laying in the bed sleeping.  I'm like cool, the $25 was worth it.  So I wake up this morning, and go to let her out.  I guess she decided she didn't want the nice new bed.  She had ripped the stuffing out, and was laying on her old bed.  So much for my $25, I wonder if I can return it?<br><br>

Warning: Spoilers for Dawn of the Dead<br /><br />Ok, how should I start this?  On Friday night I went out to Heath to see Dawn of the Dead.  The movie was pretty good, but if you see it, just think of it as your standard zombie movie.  Do not, I repeat, do not expect to see a remake of Dawn of the Dead.  The only thing the two movies have in common is that they take place partly at a shopping mall.  Here's my breakdown of the movie:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Good special effects<br />Plenty of blood & gore<br />Plot kept me interested<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Can you say zombie baby?  That part was soooo stupid!!!<br />Why did they have to put a dog in the movie?  Don't worry, it doesn't die.<br />After they leave the shopping mall, the director decides he wants to change the way he shoots the movie to 28 Days Later.<br />Zombies that can run????  WHY????<br />Oh, if you want to use your imagination leave before the credits start.  During the credits they show what happens after they leave on the boat.  I would rather have it end with them leaving on the boat, and coming to my own conclusions.<br /><br />I can't think of anything else right now.  It was a pretty decent movie.  If you like zombie movies, see it.  Us zombie movie fans can't be too picky when it comes to new zombie movies.<br /><br />I ended up going to Heath that night because my friend Deb lives there.  She is the one who taught me all about Lucio Fulci, and why he's the best Italian horror movie director (yes, better than Dario).<br /><br />Anyways we saw the 9:55 showing of the movie.  We bought our tickets early.  If you ever go to the movie theatre at Indian Mound Mall, bring cash.  How weird is it that they don't take cards????  Then we went out to eat at Garfields, which is a restaurant at the mall.  I do not recommend it.  The food sucked!<br /><br />Yesterday was the baby shower for my friend Amanda.  It went well.  Amanda received plenty of new things for her baby.  She seemed to have a pretty good time.<br /><br />Last night I hung out with my Brother & his friends.  We went to a pool hall and played pool for a few hours.  Since I wasn't driving I had quite a few shots of tequila.  Needless to say, I didn't play pool very well.  Then we all went to visit my Brother's girlfriend who is a server at a restaurant.  Poor girl had to deal with a bunch of drunk people.<br /><br />Now I'm over at my parents house doing laundry.  We went to Bob Evans for dinner.  Their idea not mine.  Then went to Meijers.  I got three rolls of film developed.  I'm going to have Beth put a bunch of pictures on her website.  There are pictures from Point Pleasant (WV) & the Mothman festival.  And a bunch of cool cemeteries.<br /><br />Well, I better get going.  I gotta finish my laundry & go home & clean.  My place is a wreak!  <br /><br /><br /><br><br>

Today is the day.  Dawn of the Dead!  I am so excited.  I read the review in The Other Paper, and they gave it 3 out of 4 stars.  I'm not sure how much I trust the review.  They really liked it, but Romero didn't direct it, so we'll see how good it really is.  I will give my personal review of the movie sometime this week.<br /><br />I'm also going to a baby shower on Sat.  I went to Babies R Us last night.  It kinda makes me sad to be there.  Really brings out the motherly instinct in me.  I always thought when I was younger I'd be married with children by now.  No such luck, which is actually a good thing.  I guess I haven't found the right person yet.  JOS where is that person????  Sorry, I have to pick on you a little.<br /><br />Anyways, so the baby shower I'm going to is for my friend Amanda.  I've know her since preschool, and we went to grade school & high school together.  She's having a little boy in May.  I'm really happy for her.  Her husband has a 10 year old boy from a previous marriage (her husband is 12 years older than her), so I think this baby will help her feel more like a family.<br /><br />Well, time to get back to work.  7 hours until the weekend!!!<br /><br /><br><br>

Friday Five (thanks Beth for the idea)<br /><br />If you...<br /><br />1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?<br /><br />I would have to say Italian!  My Grandmother used to cook great Italian food, I would love to use some of her recipies.<br /><br />2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?<br /><br />Hum, I would love to own a magic shop like on BtVS :)  (could I have Spike work there?)<br /><br />3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?<br /><br />I would have to say something like Laurell K. Hamilton.  Horror/fantasy<br /><br />4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?<br /><br />Well, I have my BA in History, so History of course!<br /><br />5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?<br /><br />This would be a fantasy world if I could sing.  I would love to have a voice like Sarah Brightman or Sarah McLachlan.<br><br>

3x Thursday: <br /> <br />1. What's your most memorable St.Patty's Day event?<br /><br />I usually don't do too much for St. Patty's.  I do remember when my Brother went to school in Mexico for 3 months, and came home on St. Patty's Day.  I remember waiting for him at the airport.<br /><br />2. Do you believe in the whole wearing green thing for St.Patty's Day? <br /><br />I wear green so one of my co-workers doesn't pinch me :)<br /><br />3. Without doing a Google search, can you honestly tell me why they call it St.Patrick's Day? <br /><br />St. Patrick is the Patron Saint of Ireland, it's their national holiday.<br /><br />Bonus Question for Comments: What's your drink of choice on St.Patrick's Day?<br /><br />Green Margaritas!<br><br>

What a foggy day outside, and snow on the ground to boot!  Doesn't Spring start Saturday?  I am so sick of this weather, I'm sure everyone agrees to that!  Well, pretty soon it'll be in the 80's and everyone will be bitching about how hot it is.  Not me, I enjoy the heat!<br /><br />St. Patty's day went pretty well.  After work we all went to a Mexican restaurant and drank margaritas & ate chips.  Not too Irish, but good none the less!  My co-worker Nikki actually had her husband watch her kids, so she was able to come to happy hour.  After the free drinks at the restaurant, we went back to my house and had a few more drinks.  I tell you what, I can handle my alcohol, but Nikki can drink me under the table!  After she left I watched American Idol.  Ugh, I can't believe I watch that stupid show, but for some reason I'm draw to it.  I actually went to sleep early last night, well, I guess the term would be passed out.<br /><br />Well, gotta get back to work :)<br /><br /><br><br>

I am so happy I got my tax returns back today!  That means it's time to shop.  1st thing on my list is to get a new bed for my dog.  I have a nine pound Yorkie Poo (1/2 yorkie, 1/2 poodle), named Cordelia May.  She goes by Cordy, The Cords, or BAD DOG!  She's a little over a year old, and tends to act like a puppy still, but she's so cute she can get away with it.<br /><br />Tomorrow is St. Patty's Day.  Which is cool because we are going to have happy hour after work.  Green Margaritas!<br /><br />I am also looking forward to Friday when I get to see Dawn of the Dead.  The original Dawn of the Dead is my favorite zombie movie.  I hope they don't turn the remake into crap.  I guess we'll see.  My 2nd favorite zombie movie would have to be Return of the Living Dead with the punk rockers.  I never get sick of seeing Trash "taking her clothes off again" or the great punk music soundtrack!<br><br>

Ahhh, a new blog, just like a new boyfriend, fresh, fun & exciting.  Special thanks to my friend Beth who set this all up, <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction, click here</a>  She is much more computer literate than I.<br /><br />Today is a quite snowy!  I thought the weather people were lying when they said we'd get snow, I guess I should have believed them.  I'm on my lunch hour right now, so I thought I'd post my 1st entry.<br><br>
