On February 20, 2006 I received an e-mail from Aurrora about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My good friend from high school, Amanda, passed away unexpectedly a few years ago after a battle with lupus at the age of 20.  I flew up to Chicago to attend her funeral and I stayed with her family for a few days.  While I was there, I purchased a Ouija board at the local toy store so we could try to contact her.  Present were Amanda's three sisters, and myself.  This was my first time on a Ouija board, so I did not know what to expect.  We all put our hands on the planchette.
<br><br>
This was some time ago, so I do not remember the conversation verbatim.  But we basically contacted Amber in order to say goodbye, since her death was so sudden and no one was able to really talk to her, since no one knew she would die.  We asked her if she was upset that her family chose to cremate her, and she said she was.  There was a box of jewelry that she had that her sisters were looking for but could not find.  We asked Amanda where it was, and the Ouija spelled out that the box was in her make-up travel kit.  We looked and it was there.  She answered a lot of questions, seemingly confirming that it was her.  The mother had gone out to the grocery store; we asked the Ouija if she knew what the mother had bought and how much was spent.  The mother came home and we asked her what she bought and what she had spent, and she said the exact items and the amount she spent that &quot;Amanda&quot; had told us, making us think that Amanda was with everyone she loved at any given moment, watching them.
<br><br>
The rest of the conversation was just us telling Amanda how much we loved her and missed her, and she reciprocated the sentiments.  We were all crying and in shock still, so it was somewhat comforting that we were talking to her, even if there was a possibility that it was not really her.  I was uneasy at some moments, wondering if it was really her.  But nothing weird or scary happened, and we said goodbye to her without any incident.  I had to fly home the next day.  The sisters have since told me that they have tried to contact her with the Ouija board again, but it never worked.  Maybe since she had just passed away her spirit was still lingering, and then left for good.
<br><br>
We divided the contents of the jewelry box among the four of us; I am still wearing the gold hoop earrings that I was given, years later.  It kind of makes me think she is still with me.  To this day I am about 75% sure that it was Amanda that we talked to, just because the conversation was so pleasant and gave us closure, but there is that possibility that it could've been a deceptive spirit trying to manipulate us.  Even so, speaking to her on the Ouija board right after her death is something I will never forget.&quot;
