It seems like it's been AGES since my last post.  I've just been really busy.  I thought I'd have more time to play online tonight, but I didn't get my pictures developed when I expected, which in turn caused me to get a later start on scanning them for the site.  However, Cord Camera took blame for the extra hour of developing time and took 20% off.  And I didn't even have to ask them, I thought that was really cool!<br /><br />Anyway, two new major pages on the site:  <a href="hallofrogs.html">Halloween Frog Pictures</a> and the <a href="currmonth.html">October Frog of the Month</a>.  I think the Halloween pictures turned out rather well, even though I am still sad about the frogs lack of willingness to wear the vampire, ghost, and bat costumes.  But the witches are cute :)<br /><br />Anyway, I need to finish some other stuff up.  But before I log off I want the people whose journals I read to know that I will be visiting their sites in the not too distant future (probably tomorrow) so I can catch up on the entries that I've missed reading the past three days! :)<br><br>

YUCK!  All I can smell right now is frog pee.  Yes, frog pee.  I attempted to take the Halloween Frog pictures tonight.  Maybe it's the weather, or maybe they wanted to be devils instead of witches...but whatever it is, the frogs were absolute monsters tonight!  No one wanted to sit still for long, in fact, the <a href="mypacman.html">Pacman frogs (Albert, Rambo, and Mason)</a> and the <a href="mywtf.html">White's Tree frogs (Emily and Sandy)</a> are the only ones that stayed still enough for me to take any pictures.  I was getting frustrated with the hopping around stuff, but then things got worse.  It was Rambo's turn to pose for the picture.  I put him down in the Halloween scene I created, and as soon as I put him down I saw the big puddle of pee form around him.  Then the ammonia smell hit.  I finished taking his pictures,  the only pictures left to take were the White's tree frog pictures.  They usually don't pee all over everything like the pacmans.  Usually is the key word.  Emily was fine, but George did the same thing Rambo did.  So the desk smelled like frog pee, but I was OK.  I finished up the roll of film and went to put the next roll in the camera.  However, I forgot to bring the new roll into the frog room so I needed to walk over to my bedroom to get it.  I didn't want to put Emily and Sandy back in the cage, so I "stuck" them to my shirt.  Yes, you read that correctly...tree frogs like to climb and stick on things, which is cool because they'll even stick to a person's clothes...well, until they decide to jump off anyway!  I've done this before, no problems.  Again, tonight was different.  I was halfway to my room (which isn't a long distance) when my shirt felt wet...George decided to pee on me too!  What a mess.  After I finish this blog entry I need to change and take a shower!!<br /><br />Anyway, I think the pictures will be cute.  I went to 2 different JoAnn fabric stores because I forgot to get the fabric to cover up the desks at the first one I went to.  Both of the women measuring the fabric asked what I was going to make with it.  I told them the truth, that I was going to use it for frog picture backgrounds...it was obvious from both of their reactions that tonight was the first time they've heard that response! :)  Anyway, I agreed to bring pictures into the store for them to see.  My frogs are getting to be quite popular! :)<br /><br />Well, I need to go and clean up, I can't take this much longer.  I really can't smell anything right now other than antibacterial hand wash and gel, and Lysol Antibacterial spray.  However, even though I can't smell anything, I still feel dirty!<br><br>

The first part of the day went so fast...however, the last hour has gone extremely slow.  I feel really tired today, I really do believe that the gloomy weather has a lot to do with this.  <br /><br />The section of the parking lot I always park in was blocked off this morning.  I hope I remember where I parked my car :) It's not that big of a parking lot, I really doubt that I'll not be able to find it.<br /><br />I think I'm going to put up my Halloween decorations tonight!  Yea, it's a few days early, but I honestly don't care.  And of course that shouldn't surprise anyone who knows me, afterall I am the girl that wears Halloween socks (like black and orange striped, skulls, spiders, etc) all year!  I need to get to JoAnn fabric sometime too so I can get the material to make the Halloween costumes for the frogs!  It's times like this that I wish I could sew...I'd have more options for costumes if I could.  The 4-H sewing project that I took the summer after 3rd grade is what totally made me hate sewing, and I haven't sewed anything since!  My mom helped me with that project, a shirt and skirt outfit, and her hate for sewing rubbed off on me.  I remember I learned all sorts of fun, ummm...colorful words from my mom during that project!! <br /><br><br>

I walked out to the parking lot with Brenda and Sheri, which is what I normally do when I leave on time.  Sheri had told us earlier that it had really cooled down a lot outside, and when I opened the door I was surprised at how much cooler it was!  I truly do love this cooler autumn weather!  It has been raining constantly, but it's a very light rain.  The plants will like it.  I wish it we would get thunderstorms though.  I think we're supposed to, we're supposed to get tons of rain overnight through tomorrow.  Even though it isn't raining very hard, it's still raining hard enough to hear and the sound is making me sleepy.<br /><br />I'm not in an internet mood right now, which is odd since I'm an internet addict.  I should start on the October Frog of the Month page since September is almost over.  I could get it finished now and then all I'd have to do is FTP it next week.  I'll probably wait until 10PM on the 30th though, I tend to do things at the last minute.  Really though, it'll probably only take about 15 minutes to do it so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I volunteered to help Sheri out with some regression testing for her CLS project.  I think there were about 6 test plans that she needs executed by next Friday.  I'll be quite busy with helping Deidee out with the quarter end QC stuff, but since she desperately needed help I volunteered to take one of the six test plans.  The one I took is one that most people dislike.  I really didn't think it was bad...unless I find a problem that is!  Only 50% of it needs executed, which I assumed meant looking at about 25 contracts, because the last time I executed it (I think it was during September of 2001) it required looking at 50 contracts.  I was shocked when I pulled up the test plan and saw "you should find at least 100 contracts..."!  Still, it should only take about 8 hours.  It requires a monthly flow to be run, but if I coordinate it correctly I should be able to use next Monday's regularly scheduled monthly so I won't have to request a special one.  Still, I should have chosen one of the easy test plans on the list :)<br /><br />I am so happy that tomorrow is Friday.  The week went really fast...they all seem to be going faster now in my old age.  Hahaha, a few of my coworkers would be giving me dirty looks right now in response to the old age comment!  <br><br>

The All Ohio Reptile show is this weekend.  I've been thinking about going and looking for more White's Tree Frogs.  Also, I need to take some Halloween Frog pictures soon! :)  I have lots of costume ideas, I'll just have to wait and see which ideas will actually work.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.savekaryn.com">Save Karyn</a>.  I know people do some crazy stuff, but this site was just too much.  I really can't believe people are sending her money!  Honestly, I think it's pretty pathetic to ask others to pay off your debt instead of working to pay it off yourself.  But hey, she's getting people to donate so I guess she knows what she's doing.  I don't think I could do anything like that, I have too much pride!<br /><br />We're supposed to get lots of rain here today and tomorrow, and that makes me very happy...now I won't have to water the plants!<br><br>

I added a new page to the site tonight...Cindy, my former manager, gave me a few pictures she took during my frog presentation at her son's preschool back in January.  She told me that she has more pictures to give me, but her son has both copies of the pictures at his school.  She said she asked the school to send the double prints home with Tyler but they haven't done it yet.  I'm in no hurry, I look awful in all of the pictures so I'm definitely not in a hurry to post them on the site :)  It was really hot in the preschool, I do remember that I felt sweaty.  Anyway, the 4 pictures she did give me are on the  <a href="teach2.html">Frogs in Preschool page</a>.  I'll post the other pictures when I get them...hopefully they'll look better!  Of course, I don't think I've ever been in a picture that I've liked.  It seems that most (not all) people dislike pictures of themselves, so I guess it's not unusual that I dislike these.<br /><br />My sister came over for dinner tonight.  That was unexpected, but it was fun. Good thing I hadn't already eaten dinner when she called.<br /><br />I really don't mind feeding the frogs crickets, they don't gross me out at all.  However, it is extremely annoying when I get a noisy cricket...there is one cricket in Jorge's aquarium that keeps chirping and it is really starting to get on my nerves.  I haven't been able to find it, but when I do I'll make sure it never chirps again, mwahahahaha(an evil laugh).  <br /><br />In other frog related news, I am now one of the Assistant Managers for the <a href="http://groups.msn.com/frogstoadsotherfriends">Frogs, Toads, and Other Friends</a> MSN group.  I think it'll be a fun group, I like reading about other people's pets and helping others out with their pet frogs.  <br /><br />I need to figure out what to wear tomorrow.  I miss being able to wear jeans everyday to support Operation Feed.  Getting ready for work was definitely much easier when I could just throw on jeans and a golf shirt.  Oh well, at least we still get to dress down on Fridays for Op Feed.<br><br>

The garbage truck came at 2:20AM this morning...and of course I had a difficult time falling asleep after it woke me up.  I did manage to fall asleep though, and I had weird dreams.  I can't remember everything, but I do remember dreaming that instead of getting up when my alarm went off, I fell back to sleep and was going to be late for work.  The thought of being late was really making me upset.  Then I really did wake up and I was sure that it wasn't a dream and that I really did sleep in!  I got up to get my contacts so I could see, but before I got them my alarm went off.  I wasn't late afterall!  What a weird way to start the morning.<br /><br><br>

Today wasn't a great day at work, it wasn't terrible or anything...things just got on my nerves.  I was in a training class this morning from 9-12.  I didn't think it'd last the whole 3 hours but it did, and it was just because a few people kept going on and on about the same subject.  Also, I'm officially tired of people complaining about last year's lack of raises.  OK, our managers did lie about whether or not some people got raises, that came out in last week's department meeting when they admitted that some people (very few) did indeed get raises.  There were so many rumors going around saying that there were people who got raises, I'm suprised that announcement came as such a surprise to some.  Anyway, sure management would have gotten more respect if they came out and admitted that there were raises...or then again, maybe they still wouldn't have been respected.  Because some people complain no matter what.  Honestly though, it's now the end of September and raises were given around the beginning of April (or maybe it was March, I can't remember when the common effective date is)....how long are people going to complain about this??  This is the sort of stuff that gives me headaches.<br /><br />Tonight I cleaned the frog terrariums and gave them all more crickets.  I didn't feel like battling the traffic on Morse Road, so instead of going to Captive Born Reptiles I went to Petland because I knew they sold feeder mice.  I like Petsmart better (but I hate Petco), but they don't sell feeder mice.  Which is stupid really...they sell the snakes, lizards, and frogs but they don't sell the mice that these herps should eat when they're older.  Anyway, the only live feeder mice Petland sold were the regular adult mice.  My frogs aren't big enough for those, they just eat pinkies and fuzzies.  Petland did have frozen pinkies though so I got three of those.  This was the first time I've tried buying frozen mice for my frogs.  It was REALLY gross!  You thaw them in a cup of warm water for 15 minutes.  Then you have small, dead, pink, ugly, hairless baby mice.  I prefer feeding them live ones.  Pinkies are pretty disgusting, but dead pinkies are worse.  Rambo and Jorge wouldn't eat them, but they never eat pre-killed food.  Mason ate two of them, and Albert ate the last one.  Everyone's happy with the crickets though!  And everyone likes the new substrate in their tanks :)<br /><br><br>

I got quite a bit accomplished tonight.  My laundry is finished, and I've cleaned the house.  The laundry room was packed tonight, but towards the end of the evening it was just me and the new couple that have moved into the complex.  They had tons of laundry, but they were very nice and left two washers and two dryers for me to use.  Not many people are that kind.  In fact, sometime people are really rude in the laundry room.  For example, if I'm waiting for a washer or a dryer, I never remove the other person's clothes, I just patiently wait for them.  The majority of the time people come to remove their clothes from the machines within 10 minutes.  However, some people must feel that they can't afford to wait that long, and they remove the other person's clothes.  I think that's so rude, because who wants a stranger touching their clean clothes?!  There are only a few people that do that, so it's usually not a big deal.  I always take my clothes out right away...washer cycles are 26 minutes and the dryers take a full hour.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.siteturn.com">Siteturn</a> sent out some generic explanation as to why the site was down.  They said that they had a technical problem this weekend, and when they fixed it it effected a small number of site's abilities to FTP, etc.  I haven't checked my work voicemail tonight, it'll be interesting to see if they called me back.  <br /><br />Anyway, I still need to fold laundry.  I better get that done before it gets too late (and before everything wrinkes sitting in the pile of clothes on my bed!).<br /><br><br>

<b>I am once again able to FTP files to my site!!!!!!!</b><br /><br />I <b>finally</b> got in touch with a service representative on <a href="http://www.siteturn.com">Siteturn's</a> live chat feature.  Joshua was quite helpful, he told me to e-mail their billing department for credit on my account.  And I finally got in touch with someone on the phone...they are supposed to call me back shortly with an explanation for the downtime.  They were actually helpful, it's just too bad it took about 36 hours to get in touch with someone.  If they only would have provided me with help Saturday or even yesterday...maybe then I wouldn't have filed the complaint with the Oakland, CA Better Business Bureau.  Oh well, too late for them now!<br /><br />I really got myself angry about that awful webhosting service...so angry that I have a terrible headache now as a result.  But I can post to my blog again and update my site, that's the good news!<br /><br />Anyway, time to get back to work. <br><br>

Still no answer regarding the status of my FTP problem.  I can't stand not being able to update my site, it's torture!!<br /><br />The weekend went by too fast, I can't believe it's Monday.  It was difficult to get out of bed and get ready for work...I had the window open and the room was nice and cool, almost cold, and I was so warm under the blanket and comforter.  I forgot how nice it is to sleep when the weather is cooler.<br /><br />So today I no longer report to Cindy, I report to Ben.  He has our first team meeting scheduled for 2:00 this afternoon, and I also have a one-on-one meeting with him this morning at 10:00.  Other than those two meetings, the only other meeting I have scheduled is a Statements and Confirms meeting downtown from 4:00-4:30.  I'm still not sure I'm going to attend since I'm being phased out of Statements testing.  <br /><br />Hopefully I'll have my FTP abilities back by this afternoon.  I'm planning to call Siteturn again after my 10-11 meeting, even if I can FTP.  I need to express my frustrations with their company to someone, and find out how they're going to back-up their 99.9% uptime and 24/7 tech support guarantees!<br /><br><br>

I've now realized how addicted I am to the internet.  Around 1:30 AM on Saturday, September 21 I attempted to publish a blog entry to my site.  The blog entry posted, however it was not published due to the error "Unable to establish FTP connection".  I have not been able to ftp files to my site since Friday afternoon.  And it's been absolutely terrible!!  I also think that my webhosting company (<a href="http://www.siteturn.com">Siteturn</a>) sucks for a few reasons:<br /><ol><br /><li>They guarantee 99.9% uptime.  Well, since my site was down on a regular basis I started having <a href="http://www.internetseer.com">InternetSeer</a> monitor my site's performance.  So far in September my site has been down for 20 hours and 34 minutes.  Doesn't sound like 99.9% uptime, does it?!<br /><li>They also advertise 24/7 technical support.  I haven't received a response to my e-mails about my ftp problems.  When I tried calling, the message said tech support is only available by phone Monday-Friday, 9AM-7PM PST.  The message also said that tech support is available by e-mail and the live chat feature on their site 24/7.  When I tried using the live chat feature it said it is only available Monday-Friday, same hours as the phone.<br /><li>The website says that all tech support e-mails will be answered within 4 hours.  I sent the first e-mail yesterday morning at 10:36AM.  Like I said above, I haven't received a response.  Unless I'm not good at math, I think that's a lot more than 4 hours!<br /></ol><br />So I'm going to get in touch with someone at Siteturn tomorrow, even if it takes me all evening after work to do so.  I'm totally fed up!<br /><br />Anyway, I should go ahead and write about my day yesterday even if I can't publish this entry right now.  <br /><br />Mom and I went to the <a href="http://www.hockinghillsfleamarket.com">Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market</a> yesterday.  I wasn't really excited about going, but I'm glad we did...I finally found the Early American Prescut individual salt and pepper shakers!!!!  I've been trying to find a pair for about 6 months now!  They are in great shape, and I got a good deal on them.  Now the only rare EAPC piece that I'd really like to find is the panelled bowl.  Well, and if I ever stumbled upon a bud vase that would be cool too :)  Anyway, the individual salt and pepper shakers were a great find.  I also got an EAPC juice glass from the same vendor for only $1.00.  I found a few other things at the flea market, like two Indiana Glass Company Whitehall glasses for only $0.50 each, and five Anchor Hocking Soreno honey gold juice glasses for only $0.10 each.  Not bad at all, I was glad we went.<br /><br />We also went to the Logan Antique Mall.  I found some more EAPC stuff for really terrific prices - 2 juice glasses and 3 tumblers, and also a smooth rimmed small dessert bowl.  Mom found an antique wooden swing picture frame at a really good price too.  It was a fun day!<br /><br />The weather has finally cooled down and it's starting to feel like fall.  I turned the AC off and have all the windows open again.  It's supposed to cool down to 49 degrees tonight, and the high tomorrow is only 66...I love cooler weather!<br /><br />Anyway, I should finish cleaning the house.  I made <a href="chickenchiladas.html">chicken enchiladas</a> tonight, and while it's a very easy recipe, it always results in a lot of dishes to wash :(  <br /><br />Hopefully I'll be able to publish these last 2 blog entries soon!<br><br>

I tried going to sleep about an hour ago and laid in bed for about 45 minutes and still didn't feel tired or ready to fall asleep.  So I decided I may as well get up and do something productive until I do feel like I'm ready to fall asleep.  I'll regret this when I wake up "late" tomorrow...and I'll probably regret it if I wake up "early".  I'd like to sleep until 9AM, that would be sleeping in for me on a weekend.<br /><br />If a guest walked into my place right now their first reaction would be "wow, does this girl ever vacuum or sweep her floors?!".  The floor is pretty messy, but that's a result of me cleaning the closet.  I'm planning to put my Halloween decorations up next weekend, and I thought it might help to dig the Halloween box out of the closet.  When I opened the closet door I realized just how difficult that task was going to be.  I have a bad habit of throwing things in the closet without organizing them.  As a result I have stacks and piles of stuff in the closet.  Tonight I pulled everything out of the closet so I could get to the Halloween box - the box that was the furthest in the back, at the bottom of a stack of boxes. So now I have little bits and pieces of stuff all over the floor - little pieces of cardboard, paper, tinsel, etc.  I was pretty sick of cleaning tonight so I decided to leave the vacuuming for tomorrow.<br /><br />There's still a chance of rain for tonight and tomorrow morning so mom and I have decided to cancel our Springfield Flea Market trip. Instead we're planning to do stuff around here.  Dill's Greenhouse in Canal Winchester is having their fall open house, I think we're going to go to that.  And there's always the Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market and the Logan Antique Mall.  We can wait and decide what we'll do tomorrow.<br /><br />Someone from Columbus signed my guestbook.  She also sent me an e-mail.  She's a consultant currently working at Nationwide - what a small world!<br /><br />My coworkers always buy me frog things for my desk at work.  Today Cindy found a little multicolored beanie frog at Once Upon a Child.  Now it's sitting on my CPU :)  Pretty soon my entire desk will be covered with frogs!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.captainfrog.com">Gerry and Captain Frog</a> e-mailed me yesterday to let me know that <a href="prince.html">Prince Pierre's</a> clone mysteriously returned from Newport News, VA where he was MIA.  Gerry sent another e-mail with some additional details, and all I can say is that it's one very interesting story!<br /><br />All this typing and internet stuff has finally made me feel like sleeping.  Maybe I'm so used to writing in my blog each night before I go to bed that my body has worked blogging into my pre-sleep routine?  Hmm, if that's the case it could cause problems if I spend the night someplace else or go on vacation.  But I doubt that's really what's happening, my guess is that I just had a busy night cleaning and got my second wind.  <br><br>

I went to New Uses during my lunch break today.  I went down the kitchen aisle, which is where I usually find the glassware I collect, but I didn't see anything.  I was so disappointed because I thought I'd leave without finding anything.  But I was wrong.  I was looking through the vase section when I saw it...an 8 1/2 inch Anchor Hocking Early American Prescut vase!  And it was only $3.00...I just bought one a few weeks ago because I didn't have it yet, and I paid $15.  What's sad is that this one is in better condition than the more expensive one!!!  <br /><br />I also picked up two other things at New Uses.  I have been writing new recipes down on notecards, so I bought a plastic recipe box for $1.00 to store them in.  I also found a glass lamp that's probably about 30 years old.  It has a clear, round glass base with a clear, narrow glass pole.  The globe on it is sort shaped like a halogen lamp, with the big open top.  The globe is also glass, it's a light amber color with a star-like pattern cut into it.  I'll take a picture of it sometime and post it on my <a href="antiques.html">antiques page</a>.  It was only $20, which isn't bad at all for a glass lamp.  <br /><br />Today hasn't been bad at all.  There are quite a few people in the office, and I've been busy all day.  I can't believe it's already after 2:00!  Only about an hour and twenty minutes left...<br /><br><br>

What a day!<br /><br />The funeral was rather sad and depressing.  The only people that attended were me, my parents, 3 aunts, 1 uncle, 3 cousins, 3 neighbors, and the guy that is in charge of the Fairfield county historical parks.  This was definitely the smallest funeral I have attended.  And he only had three flowers arrangements, including the spray for the casket that mom got.  It's sad, but I have to keep reminding myself that it was probably what he wanted, afterall, he did want to keep to himself and not talk to anyone when he was alive.  Mom and dad were telling me that one of his old coworkers from Bell labs went to the viewing last night.  I guess people at work enjoyed talking to him, but he'd never socialize with them after work, and since he wouldn't get a telephone at his house they could never call him.  He also told them that a few people did try to visit him at home, but he'd give them wrong directions so they couldn't find his house!!  Too strange.<br /><br />Talking with my family at the funeral home was mildly amusing.  My Aunt Sharon got a new dog, it's one that they found wandering around their neighborhood.  Actually my cousin found him, and he and his wife thought the dog's face resembled Jesus, he even had the beard.  So they were going to name the dog Jesus, but luckily my aunt decided not to.  My cousin Brad said that was a good thing because last week the dog almost got squashed when a 1/2 gallon of ice cream fell out of the freezer and almost landed on the little seven pound dog.  He thought it would have been awful to go to the vet and say "We killed Jesus with a carton of ice cream"...that would have been bad!  I'm not sure that all of the other members of the family found it to be as funny as we did.  <br /><br />Tomorrow it's back to work.  Friday again, that means no one will be there, which means it will be quiet and the day will drag on forever!  Maybe I'll be wrong and they'll be plenty of people there.  I doubt it.  At least I get to wear jeans, that's the best thing about Fridays.  It's definitely worth the donation to the Mid-Ohio Foodbank.<br /><br />Maybe tomorrow during lunch I'll make a field trip to the New Uses on Sawmill road.  I haven't been there for a few weeks so maybe they'll have some new glassware that people have brought in.  It's always fun to look, you never know what you'll find.  Even though I compare it to a yardsale, it's much better because there's not as much junk and there's absolutely no clothes!<br /><br />Wonder if we're still supposed to get storms or rain tonight?  I hope so, I always sleep better when it's raining.  I think we will get storms, it's getting really windy.  Oh, and I just heard thunder!<br /><br />Speaking of sleep though, I had a really odd, almost scary, dream last night.  I always have strange dreams, but the past few days I haven't remembered any of them.  There are two fake places that are occasionally in my dreams:<br /><ol><br /><li>The city - it's a really dark city with a really big graveyard right in the middle of it.  There are lots of dark, narrow streets and lots of hills.  The buildings along the streets are all old and dirty looking, and quite a few of them are abandoned.  There are always a lot of creepy people that live there.<br><br><br /><li>The country setting - in this setting there is a really long path through a woods, and on the other side of the trees that border the path there are big ponds.  The ponds look really deep and dark and the water is perfectly still.  Miles down the path there is an old abandoned town.  It almost seems like an abandoned camp full of old cabins similar to the ones at Tar Hollow's 4-H camp, except the cabins in the dream have holes in the roofs and window screens.  Also, the "campground" has abandoned, dusty stores and other buildings.  You have to go down a hill from the path to get to the "campground".  Most of the people in this setting are people I know, but sometimes there are ghosts around the ponds.<br /></ol><br />Anyway, last night's dream took place in the city.  I met my mom, dad, and a few people from work (Ben, Sheri, Deidee, Heather, and Stacie) at the graveyard.  I wanted to go through this abandoned house at the top of a hill and look for old glassware.  Heather was the only person that would go with me.  Sheri really didn't want to go with me, she told me "I hate antiques, I don't want to go with you!".  We made it up the hill, but it was an eerie journey.  We passed lots of homeless people on the way there.  We went into the house, and there were lots of homeless people there.  I saw a red glass bowl in one of the back rooms.  Some homeless guy told me not to go back there because Ruby, a homeless lady, claimed that room as hers and she didn't like visitors.  I said I didn't care.  I went back there, and Heather stayed with the homeless guy.  When I went in the room it was empty, so I crawled though a bunch of junk and took the glass bowl and put it in my shoulder bag.  I was getting ready to leave, and as I went to go through the door this old homeless black lady wearing a dirty dress and a shawl stopped me.  For some reason I knew this was Ruby and that she practiced Voodoo, I don't know how I knew, but it was a dream so that doesn't matter :)  She blocked my way out and told me that I wasn't welcome and that I'd have to be punished for what I did.  I turned around and ran out of the other door in the room (there were two doors, both on the same side of the room, but they lead into different hallways.  I ran out of the house and headed for the graveyard to meet the others, and Ruby chased after me, cursing. About 3/4 of the way back to the cemetery Ruby stopped chasing me, and she disappeared.  I made it back, and Heather was there.  I yelled at her for not helping me, but she said she was scared and that she didn't like me enough to stay and help me!  We started to walk to a shoe store when I saw Ruby come around the corner behind me, screaming that she was going to kill me. That's when I woke up!  <br /><br />I have no idea what could have prompted that dream!  Welcome to the world of my messed up dreams!   My dreams never make any sense, but this blog will be a good place to jot them down so I can keep track of them and watch for patterns.  Hopefully tonight the places (and make believe people like Ruby and the homeless guy) won't be in my dreams!<br /><br />We're getting a bad storm now (and it's been going on for the past 5-6 minutes), very similar to the one we had last night.  No hail tonight though.  I should jump in bed now while it's still raining, maybe that will ensure pleasant, <b>normal</b> dreams!<br /><br><br>

Comments still aren't working.  And I just wrote a big, long blog entry, posted & published it...but now it's not showing up.  And I just changed my imood to accomplished.  Maybe I need to change it back to frustrated!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, this post won't be as long, but basically here's what I said in the last one:<br /><br />Tonight I finished the frog of the month pages.  You can see the current frog of the month by <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/currmonth.html">clicking here</a>.  It would have been done sooner, but we had a wicked storm here with lots of lighning, thunder, and even a little hail.  I didn't want to lose all of my work in case the power went off before I saved everything, so I just shut the computer down and took a little break.  It gave me time to clean the frogs' water bowls.<br /><br />I accomplished a lot tonight:  the web stuff, grocery shopping (which I absolutely hate doing), and filling up the truck's gas tank.<br /><br />Now I'm tired, I need sleep bad.  Tomorrow's my great uncle's funeral so I should make sure I have something nice to wear that isn't too wrinkled from hanging in the closet for ages!  I hope I don't have to iron, that would just suck.<br /><br />OK, I'm ready to sign off for the night.  Maybe <a href="http://www.haloscan.com">haloscan</a> will be working tomorrow.  If it's not, maybe I'll take <a href="http://www.conformity.ontheweb.com">Erik's</a> suggestion and try <a href="http://www.enetation.co.uk">Enetation</a> instead.<br><br>

Well, that didn't take long...Haloscan is down AGAIN!  As a result, my comments are disabled once again.<br /><br />I'm going to work on some other pages for my site.  Maybe by the time I'm finished with them comments will be working again?  We'll just have to wait and see...<br><br>

Comments are working again!  <a href="http://www.haloscan.com">Haloscan</a> posted info about the downtime on their site.<br /><br />Anyway, it's time to shut down the computer and head for home.  I'm only leaving about 10 minutes late since I was 15 minutes late due to the traffic problem on I-270 this morning.  I won't complain too much, so far this has been the only time I've been stuck in traffic on 270 since moving up here to the Tuttle area in May.  <br /><br /><br><br>

Hmmm, I wonder if Haloscan is just down temporarily?  I hope so.  If not I guess I'll just have to find a new comment host.  It's still frustrating though.<br /><br />My first MUG (Mercury User's Group) meeting as the secretary went fine.  I took lots of notes, it'll take me a little while to type them up in a word document...sometimes I have a difficult time deciphering my own handwriting when I take minutes :)<br /><br />Anyway, I'll log on again tonight and write about the newest frog thing I'm working on for my site...the Frog of the Month contest! <br><br>

I had to remove the comments option for now...Haloscan is down, and if I leave the comments code in my blog I can't access it!  I'll check after my meeting, and if Haloscan is working again I'll add the comments code then.<br><br>

Today has been a pretty good day.  <br /><br />I really can't wait to decorate for Halloween...only a few more weeks until I can!  It honestly is my favorite holiday, the decorations are so much fun.  My all time favorite decoration is the Haunted Toilet.  I bought the Haunted Toilet in November of 1995.  I didn't actually display it until October of 1996...it was one of those decorations I decided to buy after Halloween when everything was 50% off.  Anyway, the HT is this small brown/black toilet.  When you flush it, a skull pushed the lid open from the inside and says "Happy Halloween, hahahahaha", and it repeats it one more time.  It's really kind of stupid when you think about it, but it's so stupid it makes me laugh!!  It's starting to get a little old, and every year I worry that it will no longer work. I have never been able to find the haunted toilet again, so I don't know what I'll do when it breaks!  <br /><br />I buy lots of Halloween decorations each year, but until last year I hadn't found a decoration to compare to the haunted toilet.  Last year I found a skull decoration with four black roses on the top of it.  It has a button on it's forehead, and when you press it it plays the Funeral March (a spiced up version!) and the roses dance!  It's so stupid, it also makes me laugh each time I play it.  I haven't found any animated decorations that I want this year, but I haven't hit all of the stores yet! :)<br /><br />Halloween is really on my mind right now after talking with my coworker Karen this morning.  Karen sent out an e-mail asking for any old sheets, tents, and tarps for a haunted campground.  I have some old sheets to donate, so I stopped by her desk to tell her.  Then we started talking about past haunted houses we've been associated with.  And now she's invited me to help at her haunted campground on 10/19!  I haven't helped with a haunted house type of thing since 1998, this will be so much fun!  So far I've helped her find some good fake blood recipes:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.shades-of-night.com/painneck/blood.html">The Raven's Fake Blood Recipes</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.azodnem.com/Lounge/Jason.htm">Jason Sullivan's Blood Recipes</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.halloweennet.com/site/html/blood.html">Halloween Net Blood Recipes</a><br /></ol><br />Well, my lunch break is over, I need to finish up some work before the big department meeting this afternoon.<br><br>

Chrissie rescheduled our dinner at the Ocean Club to tonight instead of Wednesday.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to go, because Mondays are always busy for me.  However, tonight wasn't too busy so I was able to go.  Dinner was pretty good, I had Crab Stuffed Sole, but I do have to say that I like Mauger's much better.  It was fun to talk with Jennifer, Chrissie, Kyle, and Sarah - it's been awhile since we've all gotten together as a group.  <br /><br />My stomach is really churning now, I don't feel the greatest.  I'm sure it was dessert, the white chocolate key lime thing.  Probably too much milk or dairy products.  I think I may be lactose intolerant, dairy foods tend to upset my stomach.  This sick feeling hit about the time I was taking the I-670 exit from I-270 South.  I only live about 10 minutes from there, but it was a long ten minutes home.  I drank some Rooibos tea since I read it's supposed to calm stomachs.  We'll have to see if it really works.<br /><br />Anyway, we were seated no later than 6:30, and we left a little after 8:00.  Since we were at Easton we decided to shop!! :)  Kyle, Jenni, and Sarah went to Abercrombie and met Chrissie and I at Barnes and Noble.  Barnes and Noble is an awful place for me to go because I can't control myself! :)  I found a few books, and saw lots more that I'd like to read.  They have all of their Halloween books out, which means a lot of pagan and witchcraft books are on sale...it's the perfect time for a witch like me to shop for books!  I found a couple of Haunted Ohio books to read, and one even has directions to haunted buildings around the state!  I also bought Lorenzo Carcaterra's new paperback, <i>Gangster</i>, a mafia book by the guy who wrote <i>Sleepers</i>.  But the best book I bought was <i>Coraline</i> by Neil Gaiman.  Neil Gaiman is my <b>favorite</b> author, and even though it's difficult to picka favorite, I'd have to say <i>American Gods</i> was my favorite book by him.  <i>Coraline</i> is a book for all ages, one review said it's even better than <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  A lot of reviews say that it is an absolutely terrifying fairy tale...I can't wait to start reading it!!  I bet it'll be similar (not in theme, but in "story for all ages" type) to Clive Barker's <i>Theif of Always</i>.  I wasn't sure if it was out in the US yet, so I asked the guy at the information desk.  He thought it was upstairs in the juvenile section, but we couldn't find it anywhere.  He finally got in touch with the lady that works in that section and she thought it was downstairs...we finally found it about 15 minutes later in the fiction section upstairs, with all of the other Neil Gaiman books :)  They were very helpful though, that Barnes and Noble has the best staff!<br /><br />We also went to the Virgin Record Megastore.  The CD I want isn't available until midnight tonight...Disturbed's <i>Believe</i>.  One of the guys working there said I should come back at midnight to buy it, but I think I'll be fine to wait until tomorrow ;)  Besides, I'll probably we able to find it cheaper at Best Buy or Target!<br /><br />I need to get to bed...5:30 comes around so early, and I need my sleep to prepare myself for another day filled with testing fun! <br /><br /><br><br>

Something I can see my mom doing...<br /><br />"The lady was using a power strip to plug her computer and other devices into. Windows was completely frozen, and she was unable to shut down the machine by using the power button. She mentioned the power strip, so I told her to flip it off. She said, "Ok, I gave it the finger. I feel better." <br><br>

I wish we were able to get PDF files for our test statements and confirms because waiting for the paper output is just awful.  Until I get the confirms I need to look at I'm at a complete stop for testing my S&C stuff.  At least I have plenty of web updates to keep me busy!  I really enjoy updating my division's website...sure, it's still work, but it's fun!<br /><br />I have a meeting downtown this afternoon, which is really cool because I'll be able to go home right after the meeting and miss all of the after work traffic on I-270.  And it only takes me 2 minutes to get home from downtown as opposed to 20-25 minutes from Dublin.  The weekly S&C meeting downtown will be one of the things I'll miss once I stop testing statements.  <br /><br />My lunch break is almost over so I should put my headphones on (I've been listening to Stone Sour today, maybe I'll switch to Type O Negative for the afternoon) and get back to the web updates.  <br><br>

Today was such an uneventful day that I wasn't sure if I should write in my blog or not.  But obviously I decided to!<br /><br />I slept in this morning and awoke to a weird sound, it was something that I hadn't heard for several weeks....it was raining!  I'm sure my plants loved it since I often neglect them and don't water them each night.  Rain is one of the most relaxing sounds in the world to me, and it's even better when there are thunderstorms.  I listened to the weather radio a little this evening and it sounds like there's a chance of rain for most of the week.  We really need it, all of the corn fields around here look so dead.  <br /><br />Really, all I did today was sleep, read, do dishes, eat lunch, pack my lunch for tomorrow, and figure out what I'm going to wear to work tomorrow.  It was a very relaxing day, which was nice.  I can't believe the weekend is already over!<br><br>

I feel really tired right now, today was a busy day!<br /><br />I woke up around 7:55AM when the phone rang.  It was mom, and she called because she couldn't find her purse and wanted to see if maybe I grabbed it by accident and took it home last night.  I told her I'd look.  I searched everywhere but didn't see it.  Turns out it was at her house, under the blanket Oscar pulled off the couch to sleep on.  Bad little dog, hiding the mommoth's purse!  She also told me that my great uncle passed away around 5:50AM that morning.  I wasn't sure how to feel, I wasn't overly sad because I really never knew him.  But at the same time, I was sad about not feeling sad...afterall, he is family even if he did alienate everyone.  I'll probably go to the funeral, it'll be either Wednesday or Thursday.  That whole "when to have the funeral" and "when is the lawyer going to take care of arranging it" situation is a mess that I am not going into.  Mom told me about a half hour ago that she had talked with all my aunts and uncles and they are all in argeement that this lawyer is a liar and that he took advantage of an old man.  Not exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I guess stuff like this is what makes life interesting?<br /><br />Mom and I went up to Easton today.  We didn't do much shopping since we were both exhausted.  I was really feeling tired because I had to take Benadryl.  My allergies have been bad the past few days, and the wiener dogs always make me itch and break out with a rash.  Anyway, back to shopping...we went to World Market first.  I got Thai fish sauce (so I can try making my own Pad Thai), rice noodles, rooibos tea, and rosemary mint salt scrub.  Oh, and a little travel bottle of habanero hot sauce that is small enough to carry in my purse.  After that we walked around Bed Bath and Beyond.  There are always a lot of cool things in there, but I didn't find anything I had to have during this visit.  Next we went to <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/index.jhtml"> The Container Store</a>.  I had never been in there before, and I was really impressed.  Mom liked it more than me though because she found this egg container that she has been trying to find for a long time. It is nice.  Someone told me that it was really expensive, but I didn't think the prices were too bad.  I found a few things, like a really nice plastic two compartment container that I can pack my lunch in for work.  I also got a six cup container that has a cheese shredder built into the lid.  That will come in handy the next time I need to grate white cheddar cheese for enchiladas.  <br /><br />We made chicken marsala for dinner.  It was really good.  This was the first time I had dinner with Katy's boyfriend Mike in attendance, not counting cookouts.  I bet he thinks we're a really strange family now :)  Our dinner conversations can get pretty strange.  Like tonight we got started on the subject of worms.  Katy mentioned how mom always yells at us when we eat even a small piece of raw cookie dough and tells us "you'll get worms from eating that raw".  Well, mom told us that when she was growing up my grandma always worried about the kids getting worms, so she made my mom and my aunts and uncles take this worm medicine on a regular basis to make sure they didn't have any.  Definitely not your normal dinner conversation! :)  We also talked about what an abnormal child I was, and how my kindergarten teacher told my mom that I would never get higher than average grades and not to expect too much out of me.  Bet she was shocked when I made it in the top math and reading classes in fourth grade!  We also talked about my lack of artistic ability...everyone's favorite is the A+ I got on a clay bowl I made in 8th grade.  It fell on the floor when my art teacher took it out of the kiln, and as a result it's kind of rough instead of smooth.  It was so ugly that when I glazed it I mixed every color available, which produced an ugly brown colored glaze.  I also dripped black glaze down the sides.  My art teacher loved the finished product and said that it was a perfect example of abstract art and gave me the A+...and she was being serious, not sarcastic!!!!  My family finds that just too amusing :)<br /><br />Benadryl makes me extremely sleepy, so I think I'm going to lay down in bed and fall into an allergy medication induced sleep!  <br><br>

I went down to my parents house tonight.  I went to dinner with my mom and dad.  Katy was home, but she did not want to go with us.  We decided to go to China Paradise on Brice Road in Pickerington.  It's my favorite Chinese/Thai restaurant.  I was all ready to eat Pad Thai, but when we got there we saw that they were featuring a dinner buffet.  There were so many good things on it that we all decided to get that instead.  It was so good, but I ate way too much!<br /><br />When we got home Katy was downstairs working out with the radio playing loud...so loud that she couldn't hear the phone ring.  Mom got it in time though.  It was my aunt, she called to tell my mom that my great uncle was in the hospital.  She said the nurse told her they didn't think he'd make it through the night.  So mom, dad, and myself decided to drive down to the hospital to see him.  We were never very close with him, because he never really talked to us even though he lived next door to us my whole life.  Not sure what happened, but years and years ago (even before my mom was born) there was a family argument and he stopped talking with the family.  He lived a very solitary life.  But the past few years my parents went to visit him in the nursing home and he talked with them about normal everyday type things.  Well, when we saw him tonight we weren't even sure we were in the right room, because the person laying in the bed didn't look like him at all.  It was a very sad, depressing night.  I'm not going to write too many details, but I would like to say that he looked absolutely terrified.  I think it would be awful to feel alone during one's last days.  That's why we went down to visit.  Mom and dad are going to visit again tomorrow morning.  If they also go again in the afternoon or evening I'll probably tag along.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that my uncle kept looking at me.  My grandma always focused on me too.  It's weird, but older people always "flock" to me.  My mom and several nurses have noticed.  The psychic I talked to last November said that it's because I'm a very grounded person and that I emit a positive energy.  She said that helps calm people.  I didn't think much of it, but I do think she (and my mom who says the same thing) may be correct.  Who knows, right?  It does freak me out a little though, it's difficult to explain.<br /><br />We're supposed to have a chance of rain all weekend...I hope we get some.  It's been weeks since it's rained, and it shows.  All the grass and plants look so dead.  I wouldn't care if it rained non-stop for weeks!  <br /><br />It's starting to feel a little hot in my house with the air conditioning off.  I don't have my fans on right now though, maybe it will cool down to a comfortable temperature when I do turn them on.  If not I'll just have to give in and turn the air back on.  I'm so tired of hot weather, I can't wait until the highs are 70 and below!  I think I need to move someplace cold, that would be awesome!<br /><br />Anyway, I am exhausted.  I wasn't expecting to go be at the hospital, and I got a headache while I was there.  So I think I'm going to drink a glass of water and then go to bed!<br><br>

I had to post one more thing...<br /><br />If I get another 9/11 forward in my inbox I am just going to scream!  9/11 was a terrible tragedy, so I'm not trying to be insensitive, but when will people be able to move on?!  I totally understand that people who lost friends and family would still be upset, but for others it's really time to move on.  I keep getting chain letter forwards asking me to forward the message on to help others remember the events of 9/11.  But honestly, who could forget?  It's been in the news non-stop since last year!   I didn't even turn my TV on at all Wednesday.  I'm not trying to offend anyone by my opinions above, and I don't think my opinions make me "unpatriotic" like one of my coworkers implied.  I just feel like some people, not all, overreact a little.  <br /><br />Also, I got this in my inbox today:<br /><br /><i>"Pepsi has a new patriotic can coming out with pictures of the Empire State Bldg. and the Pledge of Allegiance on them. But Pepsi forgot two little  words on the pledge, "Under God."  Pepsi said they did not want to offend  anyone. If this is true, then we do not want to offend anyone at  The Pepsi Corporate office.  If we do not buy any Pepsi product, then they will not receive any of our monies.  Our money after all does have the  words "Under God" on it.  Please pass this word to everyone you know. Tell your Sunday class and tell your Pastors so that they can tell the whole congregation. Christians stand up and let your voices be heard. We want the words "Under God" to be read by every person who buys a Pepsi can. If not, don't buy Pepsi."</i><br /><br />Now, I think it's stupid to take the words "Under God" out of the pledge too, even though I am pagan.  That phrase is part of the nation's history.  If someone is offended by it, just don't say it.  If we removed everything that was "offensive" for every group out there we'd be unable to say anything :)  However, I do believe some Christians are overreacting...I get an average of 4 e-mails everyday regarding the "Under God" phrase in my inbox...all of which I delete without opening.  One of those forwards actually offended me, it said something along the lines "if people don't believe in our one God and Christian values they can get the hell out of our country"!  Talk about throwing our constitutional right's out the window...one of the things that makes our country better than others IS the fact that we have freedom of religion!  I'm not Christian, but I know I'm a much better person than some Christians out there!  As long as I live a good life and have morals, why should it matter what my religious beliefs are??!  I don't push my beliefs onto others, all I ask is the same in return.  <br /><br />Anyway, that's enough venting for today :)  <br><br>

It's Friday again so that means there's hardly anyone here at work today.  And that means it's quiet.  Which means today is going extremely slow for me.  <br /><br />I did get my laundry done last night.  I really like the new Downey liquid fabric softener scent, Clean Breezes.  In fact, I really like liquid fabric softener, epecially when washing jeans because it makes them so soft!  <br /><br />I also cleaned a little upstairs. I didn't mop though, because I forgot that I needed to buy refill cleaner for the Readymop.  So I'll probably do that on Sunday.  A lot of people I know always clean house on the weekend, but I think I like cleaning it during the week better.  Sure, it's bad because you're so tired after work, but then it's done and you can just sit back and relax on the weekend.<br /><br />I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  Which isn't bad, I've had a busy week and could use the rest.  Next weekend mom and I are going to the Flea Market Extravaganza at the Clark County Fairgrounds in Springfield.  I think that will be lots of fun.  Also, I'm going to dinner with Chrissie, Jennifer, Kyle, and Sarah next Wednesday.  Chrissie has a couple <a href="http://www.cameronmitchell.com">Cameron Mitchell</a> gift certificates that Battelle gave her as awards at work, so she's taking us all out to dinner!  I think we're going to the Ocean Club at Easton, but I'm not sure.  There are so many good choices!<br /><br />Another good thing about the realignment at work is that I'll be able to get rid of the Statements and Confirms pager. It has news updates a few times a day, and they really annoy me.  For some reason each news page comes two times, maybe 30 seconds apart.  I'm not sure why it does that.  Some people I know think the pager is kinda cool, because it makes my job seem important.  But I disagree, I don't think it's cool at all!  And really, the only time I will get pages is at quarter end. I don't want to leave it at home though and never carry it with me because I'm sure I'd manage to lose it.<br /><br />I found a bunch of new hot recipes to try out at <a href="http://www.pepperfool.com">Pepper Fool</a>.  I can't wait to try some of them, I think I printed off about 15 recipes!<br><br>

I decided to try Cream of Wheat this morning.  I had never had it before, and I kind of like it.  I think it'd be good with cinnamon in it.<br /><br />I was talking with Michelle this morning, and we talked about plecos again.  I forgot to mention it in Monday's journal entries, but I now have a pleco named after me!  Michelle was talking with her sister and her husband this weekend - their names are Mark and Kathy, just like my plecos!  They have one pleco, and they think that plecos are quite ugly.   So when Michelle told them that they had plecos named after them they laughed and decided to name their pleco Beth!  I think that's pretty cool.<br /><br />It's so nice and cool outside.  But in here it's hot!  I hate being hot, I'll have to turn on my fan.  The only thing bad about that is that my fan is pretty loud and sometimes I can't hear when people at the end of the aisle try to talk to me.  <br /><br />Mom wrote some new poetry today, I'll have to add it to the site soon.  Also, I've had about 8 people ask me about doing a frog of the month contest, like Frogland's, on my site.  Maybe I'll e-mail Dorota and ask if she would mind, it makes me feel like I'm copying her idea.  She hasn't updated her frog of the month page since March though, and lots of people would like to see it on my site.  Something for me to think about anyway.<br><br>

I decided that I couldn't put it off another night...I cleaned the ACF and the Fish tank.  The frog tank wasn't too dirty, but the bad part about cleaning it is that I have it upstairs.  That means I have to carry four buckets of dirty water down the steps without spilling it!  It's just a 20 gallon aquarium.  The fish tank is downstairs, but it's a 30 gallon tank so there's more water to clean.  It's also a tall aquarium so my whole arm has to be immersed in the toxic sludge...oops, I mean dirty fish water!  Before I got <a href="myroccoco.html">Jorge</a> I actually thought about taking the current 30 gallon fish aquarium and using it as a tree frog tank, and use the 55 gallon for the fish.  But the thought of cleaning 55 gallons of water was just too awful.  I like terrariums much better than aquariums, especially when it comes to cleaning them!<br /><br />I had a very busy day at work, but I got everything I planned to get done accomplished.  I've been working on "regular" project tasks this week, as opposed to statements tasks.  I don't think I wrote about it in the journal yet, but last week my division was realigned.  Effective 9/23 I report to a new manager (one of our current team leads), and I will no longer be a full-time statements and confirms tester.  I wasn't disappointed in that change, I did kinda miss the "excitement" of testing projects.  I think PALLM projects are more exciting for me than statements because I feel like I have a better grasp of PALLM than I have of statements.  But it's not like these past 9 months training and testing statements will be a waste, I'll still get to help out at quarter end and any time I find myself with some downtime.  I learned a lot from working with that team, and I especially learned a lot from Deidee - she is the best trainer I've ever had!  She was great to work with, very patient and she did a fantastic job explaining things!<br /><br />So it looks like tomorrow I'll finally get around to doing my laundry.  I'll also clean upstairs and finish cleaning downstairs.  Really, all I have left to do downstairs is mop.  I got a Clorox Ready Mop a few months ago, and I must say that I really love it!   It makes mopping so easy, and it really does work.  Wish they were around when my ex-roommate lived with me.  She used to mop (well, she mopped the floor 2 times in the year I lived with her, it wasn't like she did it all the time!) the floor and then put the wet mop in the closet.  Wet mops sitting in a closet for a week or more isn't a good thing, they mold pretty quick, and moldy mops really stink!  Funny that talking about mopping makes me think of her.  I think that year I lived with her really traumatized me...so much that I don't think I'll ever have another roommate as long as I live!!<br /><br />Today was an awesome day temperature wise.  I think the high was in the mid 70's.  The first thing I did when I got home from work today was turn off the air conditioner and open the windows.  The fresh air in the house is great!<br /><br />Only two more work days until the weekend!  This week has gone by fast!<br><br>

Well, I didn't do my laundry OR clean the fish tanks!!  My sister ended up stopping over after her class got out and we went to dinner.  I guess I'll do that stuff tomorrow night.  I have plenty of clean clothes so the laundry isn't a big deal.  And the aquariums really aren't that bad, they've been much worse so they will be OK too.<br /><br />I put some new recipe pages out on the site.  I added the link to the green navigation bar, but since the most recent copies of the other 4 versions of the navigation bar are on a disk at work in my planner I'll have to update them tomorrow.  The URL for the new recipe page is <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/bethrecipes.html">http://www.hoppytogether.com/bethrecipes.html</a>.  I have more to add, but the ones that are out there now were the ones I was able to find easily tonight while digging through all of the loose recipes (ones not in books).  <br /><br />I think I'm going to pack my lunch for tomorrow, and lay out my clothes to see if I need to iron anything.  Then I think I'll listen to a little Type O Negative to relax...and then I'll go to bed to get some sleep!<br><br>

I decided to go ahead and add the option for readers to comment on my blog entries.  To do that, all you have to do is click on the blue "comment" link at the bottom of each post.  I think it'll be interesting to see if anyone actually comments on any of my entries.  I doubt anyone will, but I could be wrong.  I mean, I never thought anyone would actually visit my site, but I get quite a few visitors and they're not all people I know!  It's kinda cool.  <br /><br />My day at work is almost over.  I think I'm going to do laundry tonight.  Or maybe I'll clean the fish and ACF tanks.  Or maybe I'll be really energetic and do both!  What I really want to do is sleep :)  I haven't been going to bed at decent times the past few days...too busy working on web stuff and dealing with web problems!  <br /><br />I'm also trying to decide what I should make for dinner.  Decisions, decisions.  That reminds me...I have a few recipes that I'd like to put on a webpage.  I have lots of family recipes from the cookbook my mom and I made last year on the site, but I don't have any of the newer recipes that I have found lately.  Maybe I'll work on that tonight too :)<br /><br /><br /><br><br>

Last night was a terrible web developing night!  I finished a bunch of new pages and went to FTP them to the site using WS-FTP like I always do.  It looked like the files were transferring correctly until I got an error message on the first file I tried to transfer.  It said something like "there is not enough space left on the device".  I'm not even using 10% of my web space yet, so I knew that was an incorrect message.  I decided to FTP a test journal entry since I can FTP right from Blogger.com.  I just wanted to see if I messed something up with WS_FTP.  Well, Blogger said that the transfer was successful, but when I viewed my journal the page was totally blank.  I decided to see if the other pages I FTP'd earlier were still OK, and wouldn't you know it, they were blank too...even my main index page!  I was very angry (I can think of some other words to describe how I felt, but I'm trying to keep my site kid friendly!).  That left me no choice...I had to use the File Manager in my web admin tools.  It's terrible to use - it's EXTREMELY slow, and you can only upload one file at a time.  I corrected the index.html page, but I didn't have the patience to use file manager to correct the other files.  This morning everything seems to be working much better, but I think I'm going to write Siteturn (my webhosting company) to find out what the problem is.  I've been quite patient with them, but last night was too much.  Not only have I not been able to transfer files, but my site has a lot of downtime, especially since Siteturn guarantees 99% uptime.  Wow, it felt good to vent about that!<br /><br />Anyway, it has been a long time since I've written in the journal!  Last week was a busy week for me.  But I wanted to make sure I got everything I needed to get done completed before the weekend.  I went down to a cookout/hayride at Mark's parents' house this past Saturday.  You can read about my adventures on the following pages:<br /><br />1.  <a href="mothman.html">The Mothman Quest</a><br />2.  <a href="carpasture.html">The Old Car Burial Ground</a><br /><br />I'll probably write more tonight, but now I need to get back to work!<br /><br><br>

It didn't seem like a Sunday, and it's all because I know I don't have to go back to work tomorrow!  <br /><br />I didn't do much today.  I watered the plants and cleaned a little.  I'll probably finish cleaning tomorrow.  I did do a little shopping too.  I went to Garden Ridge to check out their Halloween decorations, and I found a few things.  But the best thing I found at Garden Ridge was candles.  They had bunches of candles on sale, and good scents too.  I also got some more black candles for the living room, since that's pretty much the only color that matches the furniture.  Also, black is my favorite color!  <br /><br />After Garden Ridge I went to World Market.  I wanted to get some Rooibos tea.  It's one of my favorites for times that I don't feel like green or black teas.  I also found some Cardamom Cinnamon tea that smells awesome!  Other than tea, I didn't buy much else.  Some more hot curry powder, I like using that on chicken, and a picture frame.<br /><br />It felt nice to take it easy today, I think I must have really needed the rest!<br><br>
