On June 5, 2005 I received an e-mail from Ron West with an ouija board story...and warning:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This is just a short summary of a story about my good friend's dad and his
experience with the ouija board.
<br><br>
Back when his dad was a teen, he and four friends went hunting somewhere in Nebraska (he didn't say the exact location). They found an abandoned shed nearby where they were hunting and decided to stay the night
there.  One of his friends had brought along an ouija board because he knew they would be camping somewhere and thought it would be a good &quot;game&quot; to bring along for this hunting trip.
<br><br>
So in the middle of the night they start to play. I don't know much about who they talked to or what because everytime he tells the story he gets emotional, but I do know that when they were &quot;playing&quot; with the ouija board, in the end it said &quot;3 will die&quot;. After they got that they stopped and put it away.
<br><br>
Over the course of three years, three of his friends died.  He and one other friend still lived. Each year one life would be taken. I don't remember how they died, but I think it was a hunting accident and two car wrecks.  After
that he never went close to an ouija board and never talked about his experience with the ouija board that much because it's too hard for him.
<br><br>
So next time you use one, please take my advice and be careful.  It could end up messing up your life or even ending it.&quot;
