		<div class="content">I am pissed.  I just typed my little paws off and the whole fucking entry went away.  Hateful evil piece of equipment.  Okay, so I most likely hit a wrong key but that just really pissed me off and I was so eloquent in my prose tonight.  Idiots!<br /><br />I started my first entry by give Beth the Brutal a new name.  She, the eccentric one, the one that treks around in her big black truck (since she doesn't own a hearse yet), the one that visits graveyards and cemeteries for fun, the one that lives in a haunted apartment, the one that will someday have to be bailed out of jail for trespassing when visiting abandoned buildings, the one that goes on ghost hunts, yes, she has the nerve to call me Bitchzilla.  Me, the kindest of all, the most generous, the most understanding, SHE calls me Bitchzilla.  She needs to understand, I have a right to complain when she grabs me a pets me, after all petting is on my terms.  Her purpose is to be at my beck and call, to provide me with  'Yums when I want them, to be there when I want attention, not when she thinks I should have treats or when she thinks she wants to pet me.  I am the boss, not her.  So I shall call her Beth, the Brutal Bitch from now on.  Deal with it Beth the Brutal Bitch, this is payback!<br /><br />Today there was a celebration lunch at the Buxton Inn.  Mommy, mommy's intended, Beth the Brutal Bitch (haha), Mommy's mommy and daddy all went there for a lunch.   A good time and much feasting took place.  Isn't it funny how mommy's mommy somehow managed to have the celebration lunch for mommy at her favorite restaurant.  Mommy's mommy loves the salmon croquettes there, plus the place is supposed to be haunted and that makes it more fun.  The waitress was lots of fun and even took everyone on a mini-tour after lunch.  Was I invited, no, even though there is supposed to be a ghost kitty there.  Bastards, always forgetting about me.<br /><br />I guess they teased poor mommy about her ring.  Chris said he had to rob winos to get it, Beth the Brutal Bitch said it was a wonderful piece of CZ and mommy's mommy wondered how many dimes Chris had to put in the bubblegum machine before he got it.  Actually it is quite pretty and tasteful.  Mommy stares at it all the time and makes it sparkle in the light and ignores conversations, she is quite mesmerized.  Mommy just needs to joke back, these foul people will tease her to death because of her very short fuse until she learns to shrug things off and tease back.  Poor mommy, she was born into a family of comedians, or wanna be comedians.  They get an "A" for trying anyway.<br /><br />Had a couple nice springlike days this week.  Oh yeah, what fun, I got to go to the barn and see the porch pigs as the outside ladies are called.  They do need to hunt more rodents and eat less cat chow or they are in danger of losing their athletic figures.  And why do the outside ladies think it is so much fun to play games with the brainless, stunted legged, those of elongated body who like to eat bodily waste, things that masquerade as dogs.  Games like "Chase me barking and watch me run, climb trees, jump on tables or go through the fence" or games like"steal the rodent I just killed and stress mommy's mommy out by running around with it in your mouth or attempting to eat it" or "smell my butt" or "chew my head while I claw you", or Max the Mangler's newest game "hump the cat".  Thankfully Max got yelled at for that, at least Fluff looked at him like he lost his mind entirely.  I am so glad I am Queen and live in the house and do not participate in any of those disgusting games.<br /><br />However, it is Ohio and it is winter again.  The daffodils are blooming, it is snowing.  Must be spring.<br /><br />What idiot thought up daylight savings time?  No one wants to lose and hour, why does it need to stay light until after nine in the summer, duh, humans and animals need to sleep.  Idiots!<br /><br />Well, I must tiptoe through the clothes, papers,  and dust bunnies on the floor and go to bed.  Been a busy day and I need to rest.<br /><br />Until my tired paws feel like typing again, best to you, Ratty, Ruler and Intelligent Life Form of this Domain.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Mommy is getting married, mommy is getting married.  I am coming to terms with this whole idea of mommy getting married.  Chris seems nice enough, he is willing to accept me on my terms and he has already been initiated into the supper routine.  You eat, I sit and stare and look pretty, you eat, I meow and show you what a long kitty I am, you eat and I tap your arm, didn't even get to tapping the table (because I am long kitty I can reach the table if I want), he caved in and gave me a bite of his supper.  He can be trained so he will do.  Mommy seems pretty happy.<br /><br />Poor mommy though.  See, mommy is kinda a prude, a very private person, and she believes some subjects are personal and not for group discussion.  However, mommy will have to learn that a marriage announcement brings out the baser side of people and they love to tease.  Heck they are probably remembering back when, like back when they used to have sex.  Mommy will have to learn to smile and blow off all teasing about submitting to her husband, middle of the night wake-up calls, having headaches.....people tease and yes, tis crude but it is reality.  And the worse their life is in that area the more apt they are to tease.  Poor mommy, her mommy's oldest brother will really tease her (he teased mommy's mommy back in  the day) and mommy will just have to smile and learn to tease back or at least put on a front of not being upset.  Heck mommy's mommy learned to say things like, well don't come knockn' I won't be interrupted, or you must be kidding, I am the boss in my family or on some occassions she just smiled and said, time will tell.  Poor mommy, tough being a private person in this world. <br /><br />Besides, mommy never let me have any fun, took me to the vet at 6 months.  Hmmmmm, let her try to lock me out of the bedroom once I move in.  She will have to behave or get used to me staring at her and most likely yowling.  Mommy thinks people are crude, wait until I give her grief and embarrass her.  muuuuwwwwhahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaa (evil laugh)<br /><br />Mommy's mommy has pretty much taken control of the planning.  She doesn't believe in waiting until the last minute on this kind of thing.  Got a reception room booked.  Woohooooooo!!!!  Going to be really good eats and plenty of them, hopefully a DJ and nice decorations just to start.  Not sure about the booze yet but mommy's mommy figures she will need something to help get her through the whole thing.<br /><br />Mommy still has a messy room.  But mommy's mommy will wait a few more months until mommy is gone then redo the room.  Mommy's mommy is trying to be good, she told mommy no rush but she figures by next April if mommy's stuff is still in there she will pack it and deliver it to mommy.  Now that would be funny to see.<br /><br />Well, another spring night in OH with freezing temps.  I must go warm myself by the fire.  Worse thing is Oscar, the oldest and fattest of the mutant dogs is in desperate need of a bath.  I mean this creature reeks and of course out by the fire I have to smell his stinkin' ass.  Whewweeee, one smellie animal.  Do they make doggie deoderant, like Sure or Arrid, this hunk of meat is rancid and needs something.  Mommy's mommy has been wiping him down with doggie bath wipes.  She is having a psychic party in 3 weeks or so and is hoping to bathe those smellie things closer to that date so they smell good in the house.  Not sure she can wait that long.  She complains about my shitter smelling but for the love of all that is holy, I shit in the shitter, it is expected to smell.  Oscar smells like a walking turd.  Sam is getting there and Max the Mangler, well he is the least smellie but he has been rolling and I do believe he must have found a dead, decomposing rodent or something.  I may have a litter box but I really think those 3 are worse.  Hope mommy's mommy puts them in boiling bath water with clorox or that old brown bottled lysol concentrate...or both!!!  Of course then their hair would fall out and they would probably blister but not sure that bothers me at all.  At least they would smell fresh.  Or perhaps she could cram them in the washer and tumble them dry with outdoor fresh Bounce sheets...just a thought.  Ahhh, pleasant thoughts they are.  Time for a nap by the fire and dreams of wiener dogs roasting over the open fire.<br /><br />Good night until next time.  RattyCatt, Ruler of Her World.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Life has taken a sudden turn.  Wow, I don't even know how to say this so I will just blurt it out.  Mommy got an engagement ring.  It is pretty for people stuff.  It is one diamond in the middle that is square and two smaller on each side in a white gold setting.  It is very pretty.  I HATE IT!!!  Chris is nice and all but wow, he just stepped in and took over as mommy's favorite.  If I had money I would buy her a ring but I am just Queen Catt, I have no money, just a charming personality and good looks.  The fact I purr is an added bonus.   Bet Chris doesn't purr.  Okay he is nice, the dumbass weenies like him and yeah, he is nice and knows where to scratch a kitty but she is my mommy.  He and I will just have to come to an understanding.   Where she goes, I go!  And before I settle in I will be sure to let everyone know I am boss.<br /><br />Mommy says a fall wedding date.  At least the family has rallied around mommy after the initial shock.  Mommy's mommy at first was shocked, then called Beth the Brutal to check out the ring (did I tell you mommy broke the news over email) and then she told mommy's daddy and when he finally started breathing again he said he was ok with it.  Mommy's mommy and daddy agree that she is 24 and old enough to make her own decisions and besides, mommy's mommy has wanted the bedroom to turn it into an antique room for a long time.  Talk about ulterior motives!  Wicked old woman.  I think I saw her taking measurements earlier.  At least over the years mommy's mommy has been buying a few things here and there so mommy doesn't go entirely without things.  If nothing else mommy has quite a collection of Longaberger baskets.  I will most likely find one of those to sleep in instead of that cheap shit mommy's mommy buys me.  I have higher expectations of sleeping quarters from mommy.<br /><br />Mommy and Chris want to buy a house.  Hello out there, remember me, the Catt, ummmmm, the place better have some sunny windows because I like to lay there and be warm.  And remember, soft blankets and no complaining if I yak up a hairball and you step in it.  Until I become accustomed to sharing my shitter you will need to expect messes in your house to.  I will rule, trust me, I am Ratty Catt, Ruler!!!!  At least I will have subjects, Lady Pepper, the Large and Sir Ash of the Squirrel Tail.  I am sure they will understand that I rule, there will be no other before me.  <br /><br />Mommy obviously did not have a clue what her news would mean.  Mommy's mommy instantly enlisted the help of Beth the Brutal and started telling mommy what she needed to know and when.  First, list of invitees (which is pretty darned large) and second, tentative dates.  Mommy just wants to get married at the courthouse and then have one helluva party.  Mommy's mommy says that is fine but she really wants some good food, not usual wedding cardboard tasting shit.  As soon as mommy's mommy can figure out how many she can start calling around for places to rent.  Then she can call around for someone to cater it.  She is hoping for pulled pork, beef brisket and BBQ chicken breasts with all the sides. Or some other good food, not tasteless cardboard wannabe food. <br /><br /> Mommy's mommy also is coming up with ideas for decorations as well and has asked some people to help out.  I do know this, mommy's mommy will see that there is a celebration.  After all, mommy is only allowed to do this once so she better have a good time and party on.  Music is puzzling, mommy likes country, mommy's mommy likes hard rock, 80's rock, all kinds of rock (she is not right you know) and just about anything else, Chris likes AC/DC (which gets approval from mommy's mommy) and mommy's daddy, well who knows.  Beth the Brutal would like some Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, and Metallica for starters....wow, what a party this will be.  What do you want to bet I will not even be invited.  I bet she doesn't even take me on the honeymoon. <br /><br />Mommy will survive but I bet this will really stress her out.  Mommy usually has let the planning be done by others and this time she has to be involved.  Woohooooo.<br /><br />Well, I am tired.  Been a tough week.  Plenty of announcements to keep everyone's blood circulating.  The best part is, I will be leaving the weenies behind.  In 6-7 months I will be wienerless.....</div><br>

		<div class="content">Sorry (just so hard for me to say that) but geez, what is with this OHIO weather.  Did we really do something here to piss God off.  I thought spring was here for a while in February then winter came back and this snow, ice, wet, cold wind, and other assorted shit just will not go away!!  Gets me down in the dumps.  I can't go play, mommy has her new boyfriend, mommy's mommy is as down about this unending winter as I am, Beth the Brutal is busy with her website and new job, and of course, mommy's daddy has his wieners that he likes to sit and stroke while he watches TV.  He is the only person I know who watches TV asleep.  Quite a feat.  He really pisses mommy's mommy off because by the time she sits her ass down at night she is tired and if she happens to dose off he will loudly say, HEY ARE YOU ASLEEP, WHY DON'T YOU GO TO BED IF YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP.  She is usually nice and just glares but I am waiting for the day she says, why don't you get your head out of your ass and stop yelling at me when most evenings all you do is hold stupid dogs and watch TV ASLEEP.  She says after being married to him for most her life she knows he is a jerk and will never change and she just accepts it.  She is wicked though.  There are some little things she does to get even that he and none of the rest of the family will ever know about, but oh my, she is evil with a capital E.  Like she says, nothing that hurts anyone but she does have lots of little tricks.  Face it, if you do all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and as she likes to say, even has to clean up their shit (she really hates cleaning the toilet bowls even with handy dandy cleaners and brushes) it gives you so much opportunity to be evil.  Ahhhhhhh, it is the little things in life that gives a person pleasure.<br /><br />Mommy has a new boyfriend.  Hmmmmm, I have a feeling this one could be pretty serious.  Mommy's mommy worries a little because of the age difference but really as long as mommy knows she will be young and beautiful and he will be older and wrinkly and tired and sleeping in front of the TV (can you tell mommy's mommy is younger than mommy's daddy by a few years) and mommy is ok with it, then she says it is mommy's business.  After all, at some point mommy's mommy has got to let mommy make her own decisions.  However, I am worried.  I hate to admit this but I am a stately older lady and I have always lived in this house on this little piece of paradise in Smalltown USA.  Even though I detest the abominations, I am used to living with the hellhounds that eat my food, slobber in my water, and aggravate me in the morning.  If mommy moves in with her new boyfriend I will either have to stay here without mommy (since I doubt he is openminded enough just to have weekly conjugal visits and let me have her here the rest of the time) or move with mommy in with him.  The problem, he has two other cats who think they rule.  DAMMIT!  DAMMIT TO HELL!!!  I AM THE QUEEN BEE, THERE CAN BE NO ONE BEFORE ME, I RULE!!!  I own mommy, she is mine, all mine.  Yes, I am having issues.  I suppose it will all work out but I always thought it would be just me and mommy tolerating these elongated rodents we live with and her parents.  I guess I can learn to accept Chris the boyfriend, even though he played football and his bones crack, because he is pretty good at petting me and knows I like Aquarinums and table food and is willing to accept my arm tapping, long kitty routine, and yowling.  But I must rule the house.  For God's sake, his one cat is part squirrel (or squarrl as one redneck where mommy's mommy works spells it, stupid hilljack, even if he does have a degree).  I mean that tail is poofy and huge and he holds it like a squirrel does.  The other cat is an older lady and she mostly lays around but what if she wants to lay where I normally lay.  So much for me to worry about.  Worst of all, what if they use my litterbox!!  I mean that is mine, truly all mine, and no one else is allowed in.  I would have to shit all over the house to get even.  Gifts from me would be found in shoes, under beds, on couches, oh the fun I could have.  Mommy needs to give this lots of thought.  Then again, my heart would break if I were not with Mommy.  I am sure this will work out, Chris seems understanding.  He better be or his shoe is first.<br /><br />Beth the Brutal has been most happy.  Her site got a nomination for some kind of award.  She is so happy.  She works really hard on her site.  Her butt is dragging these days.  New job and it is really a job, she cannot sit at work and update her site or answer her email all the time.  Poor Beth the Buttdragger, work is work and now she can only play at home.  Still, she seems to be in good spirits, probably because she and mommy and their friend Amanda went out for Mexican which means Margaritas.....OLE!<br /><br />Well think I will turn in.  Tis cold, snowy and mommy is not home.  Mommy's mommy was petting me a little while ago.  Big deal, she is not mommy.  She is probably sitting and playing solitaire, her little break away to help her mental health.  That or she is thinking up dirty tricks to do to people.  Wicked old woman.<br /><br />Well, better go, chat later.  Got a lot on my mind but really, in the long run, everything always works out.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Praise the Lord!!!  Mommy made a dent in this hellhole she calls a room.  Why I let her stay in here is beyond me, geez, even the stinking dogs hesitate before entering and they are brainless and will charge into danger mindlessly.  There is actually a path that is almost clear.  Whatever, as long as I have my bed and she keeps the sheets clean and the blankets soft I will keep her.  Really, mommy's mommy has set a date, March 1 as the day the room better be clean or she will get a backhoe and come in and clean it.  Mommy's mommy can get pretty damned evil so I think mommy will stop making excuses like she has done for the past two years (lame excuses I might add but because her life has been so full of drama mommy's mommy hasn't pushed it) and get this dumpsite cleaned.  I do hope no one calls the EPA or Green Peace.  I can see those people out there now with picket signs saying no more illegal dumping and pointing to this room.<br /><br />Wonder how this will work out.  Mommy is now working on the same floor as Beth the Brutal.  Different areas, mommy is in accounting and Beth is IT, no stupid ass, not it I T, but still one floor even in a big building might be too close.  Of course, those people there are pretty cool and if mommy and Beth the Brutal got into a fight those people would just probably start placing bets on the outcome.  Beth the Brutal did go to lunch with mommy today and she said that mommy eats like a snake...ya know, swallowing her food whole.  Mommy pretty much said go to hell, I was hungry!  I guess Beth the Brutal even walked to work and even packed a healthy lunch.  Hmmmmm, new job, new outlook?  Lets hope so.  Of course the dumbass, Beth the Brutal, walked and wore dress shoes and then wonders why she has a blister that broke and is all sore.  Geez, and she is supposed to be intelligent.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy had one hell of a day today.  Yes, it is Valentine's Day.  So she got her husband, mommy's daddy, some cards from her and why she did this is beyond me but even bought him a card from each of "his boys" the penis....I mean wiener dogs.  Rather than say thanks honey, I love you he gets pissed because as usual he got he jack shit.  He gives her jack shit for most holidays and after more than a quarter of a century she doesn't even expect anything (but she would like to be surprised even though it would be such a shock she would have a stroke or heart failure).  He acted like this was a first.  Whatever!!!  The she goes to work and manages to kill her keyboard.  Then her work, she is a tester too, went to hell because the shit just doesn't work and some bitch of a release coordinator is acting like it is mommy's mommy's fault the crap got put in the release and isn't working.  Mommy's mommy is just a tester and is just supposed to test to see if it works or not and SHIT DON'T WORK!!!  So there were some meetings about that, then lunch with the husband who sat and bitched about everything and on top of all that it was gray and rainy.  Happy fuckin' valentines day!!!  Maybe at least at Easter she can hope a rabbit will leave her a turd or something in a flower bed.<br /><br />Mommy did alright with her new boyfriend Chris.  Chris got her pretty flowers and chocolate and the bitch didn't even let me smell the chocolate, and he got her a blanket, which is different but whatever and mommy was happy.  Oh yeah, and a toy dog.  Wait until the "boys" get their mouths on that, it will die a painful death, stuffing will fly, button eyes will be swallowed and the garbage will be full.  Those damned mutant dogs are so destructive.  When they were at the vet the vet should have pulled all their teeth.<br /><br />The shortlegged creatures from hell got to go outside and to the park.  Big whoop, I got to spend a few minutes on the deck this weekend.  Is spring never coming?<br /><br />Well, time for bed.  Signing off.  See ya next week.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Pretty crappy time of year. I think I have a bad case of blogitis. Hard to blog when all that happens around here is winter. February is a miserable month. A few hints of spring with plenty of winter thrown in to dash our hopes.<br /><br />Mommy will be 24 this weekend. Mommy is pretty young in people years. So everyone wish mommy a happy birthday. She must be afraid of being an old maid because even after a nasty breakup she was able to find another guy pretty quickly. Mommy is pretty but there must be more to mommy than that, she seems to get guys pretty easily and they all seem to want to settle down with her. Sometimes though I think mommy must also have a self-preservation device that kicks in and makes her work to ruin relationships before they become permanent. So far mommy hasn't landed a guy worth keeping. Seems they all have too much baggage to suit her.<br /><br />Enough about mommy and her love life. This is Beth the Brutal's last week on her current job. She moves on and up Monday. Now that is what I call a Valentine present. I sure hope Beth likes her new job. If not, she will wait about 9 months of the mandatory year and then start applying out. She doesn't let any grass grow under her feet. She is having a very good year, she thinks odd numbered years are good for her. Hmmmm, perhaps that is because she is a little odd. Oh piss, I suppose I should be kinder, let's see, Beth the Brutal is eccentric, yeah that's a good word. After all, how many young ladies travel around photographing cemeteries, sometimes with complete strangers, and have a website called Graveaddiction. How many plan their vacations around destinations that are supposed to be haunted and of course, have graveyards and cemeteries to photograph. Yeah, I found out there is a difference between graveyards and cemeteries a while back. If it is part of a church grounds, it is a graveyard. Otherwise a cemetery.  Oh and she has a real problem with people and cats that misspell cemetery.  Gotta tell ya, she is one unusual person.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy has the psychic party all set up and has enough paying customers to make it work.  She also has the menu planned and is all excited.  She also has 2 more months to wait.  She was worried that she would not get enough people and she was also worried about the date.  Couldn't have it the cheery month of February 'cause sure as she planned it there would be a snow storm.  March is also iffy weatherwise and she is hoping that by April it will be warm enough that people can spill out onto the deck since the house is not that big.  She is also determined that mommy get her room cleaned soon or she is gong to clean it and she will have no mercy.  I know she threatened just to rent a dumpster and forklift and totally clean and gut the thing and start over.  Yes, mommy still lives at home but cannot blame her.  Mommy's mommy and daddy are generous people for the most part and mommy lives there, doesn't really ever help out a whole lot (except when mommy's mommy has a moment and blows up) and it doesn't cost her a dime.  That changes once she finishes her degree (which she really needs to get for work so not like she can drag it on too much longer) .  Mommy if she continues to live here will pay rent.  Mommy should have a hefty savings since she got a few thousand toward her education, and now work pays for the rest of it.  However, mommy's mommy thinks mommy could use some lessons in finance but has decided if she doesn't learn now she will certainly learn later and it will be more painful when she is out on her own.  Please, don't let mommy's mommy read this or she will start on how when she was single and on her own sometimes before payday she and her dog would only have popcorn to eat for supper.   OK, so life hasn't been a bowl of cherries for her, I have to eat fuckin' dry catfood all the time.  To get anything good I have to act like cute kitty and do kitty tricks.  Assholes, they just don't know how damned tough life can get.<br /><br />Of course it was in the 50's over the weekend so the hell hunds got to go outside and get fresh air, the little stunted bastards.  Saturday there was still more snow cover than mud so the turd munching mutants only came in the house wet.  Sunday however there was more mud than snow plus they got to go roam the park.   I hope their genitials itch!  The drug in burrs, mud, leaves, grass, seeds, just anything and everything they encountered on their great outdoor adventure.  I heard they were munching on tasty snack size deer turds or perhaps bunny turds, who really knows or cares.  Surprised they don't have worms.  heheheheheeeee, now there is a thought, a nice dose of worm medicine for their little intestines.  My luck they would just poop them out and think of it as a nice warm protein treat.  Dachshunds, heck, most dogs, really have a thing for poop.  Except for Clyde the Jack Russell, he likes to lick pee.  Sure, take a piss and he will lap it right up.  He also likes to pee everywhere, mommy's mommy was telling a story how Clyde's daddy let him out but did not take him to the park like Clyde wanted so Clyde came back into the house and hiked right on his daddy.  As far as I know Clyde escaped bodily harm, which is good because when he gets nervous he just pees more, everywhere, even on a dead run.  Why do people put up with these creatures.  Cats are so much better, independent, poop in our litter box...most of the time...lick our own butts or wipe them on mommy's sheets which she has to wash anyway....we are just superior creatures.<br /><br />Oh my, this was fun but it is time to go.  Perhaps I will chat later this week, just depends on my mood.<br /><br />Remember, Ratty Rules!<br /></div><br>

		<div class="content">Here I am again.  Not too much has happened since my last update.<br /><br />Beth the Brutal has a start date on her new job.  She says this last two weeks will be the longest two weeks ever.   She is starting to let her feelings out, she really doesn't like too many of the people she works with.  They truly are a backstabbing group of wanna-be-up-and-comers and there is not one speck of loyalty.  Mommy's mommy will miss Beth the Brutal working closely with her, they watched each other's back.  Mommy's mommy thinks they will smear Beth the Brutal's good name after she is gone, tis the fate of the person that leaves, last person to leave gets blamed for everything.  Beth the Brutal says she really doesn't give a shit what they do or say when she is gone.  Mommy's mommy hopes she catches one in a bit of name smearing, mommy's mommy can be most evil and loves to make these assholes cry.  See, they talk tough but they are whiney cryey babies at heart and more than once she has made they feel lower than whale shit on the bottom of the ocean.  She might be old, fat and tired, but wow, she can be the vilest of the vile if the mood strikes her and she does hold a grudge longer than anyone I know.  She never forgets and will wait years for the right moment to get even with someone that wronged her or someone near and dear to her.  She doesn't necessarily believe you have to be mean either, sometimes not saying anything when asked an opinion casts more doubt on a person's character than a harsh word.  And those idiot beings think they win points when they team up and get someone in trouble.  Mommy's mommy knows that people that have been burned by the "group" are likely to team up to get even and she recruits her pack of acquaintances (she says you rarely if ever make real friends at work)  from those that have been wronged.  Ahhhhh yes, once again I must say, in Corporate America it is survival of the fittest and the most cunning.   Age and wisdom over the stupidity of youth.....<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  not all youth is stupid, just that pack of imbeciles at work<br /><br />Mommy does have a new boyfriend and oh my oh my, she brought him home to meet her dad and mom.  While there is an age difference that mommy's mommy and dad are trying to come to terms with, at least they think he is decent.  Mommy's mommy worries that mommy falls head over heels in love with every single guy she goes out with.  Mommy's mommy just hopes mommy knows what she is doing.  But she also thinks mommy is getting old enough to have to deal with the consequences of her actions and that mommy's mommy will just have to let things play out however and step back and keep her opinions to herself.  So mommy, just remember, I am an old kitty and cannot take to much upheavel in my life, just be careful before uprooting me from my current home.  Besides, if you think I am moving in with two other cats and I will be happy about it you are dreaming.  I will be PISSY and nasty and get sick and you will have to take me to the vet and be worried.  Because I call the shots, I am the RATTY!!<br /><br />The hounds from hell have enjoyed playing in the snow cover now that the air temp is a little better.  Still, their feet get cold and then they sit and lick them.  Fools, stay out of the snow and play on what little grass is showing.  I am hoping to get out some this week.  I feel the walls closing in around me, the air getting staler, and the light is fading....wait it is night and I farted.  Ok, never mind......<br /><br />Mommy's mommy is having a psychic party in a couple months.  A psychic comes and does readings and people pay her money.  Mommy's dad doesn't understand why you need to give a psychic directions to your house or give you phone number, after all, aren't they psychic.  Mommy's mommy rolls her eyes and plans her party.   Sounds like it could be major fun, mommy's mommy friend is coming and she is bringing her cousin who is bringing her Tarot cards and a bottle of wine.  Seems the cousin reads Tarot and becomes Madame Shitface after drinking some wine.  Now this could be really interesting.  Beth the Brutal will bring some Ouija boards and mommy's mommy is cooking lots of good food.  Mommy just hasn't yet decided if she is attending or not, mommy gets kinda freaked with some of this weird spirit shit.  Mommy's mommy and Beth the Brutal love it.  Someone emailed Beth the Brutal and told her that she is killing the earth and God by playing with Ouija boards.  Wow, and people think Beth is weird, where is this email lady getting her information from.  Wait, I bet she talks to God on the phone and he is telling her this.  After all, God does have a sense of humor or he would not have permitted Corporate America to form because that is one major joke.  Also, he must be laughing His ass off up in heaven at these people that voted for George dubya and made him president because he is a moral person.   Right, send troops overseas to fight a war based on everything but facts and say you are moral.  Be governer of a state that practically has an express lane for capital punishment but say abortions and stem cell research is wrong.  I could go on and on but hey, I am just one little cat, and I can type all days but 51% of the voters in America were idiots and they call me a dumb animal.<br /><br />Well, enough for tonight.  Think I will sit here and digest that Kentucky Fried Chicken I mooched for supper and then take a nice long nap until morning.  The I will get up in the morning, ask for 'Yums, and nap until mommy gets home tomorrow night.  Ahhhhh, this is the life.<br /><br />later, The Rattster!<br /></div><br>
