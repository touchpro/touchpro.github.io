On November 17, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jennifer about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Hi my name is Jennifer, and I am in NC in the Air Force. This story that I am about to tell you is COMPLETELY true and STILL gives me chills to this day.
<br><br>
I have always been interested in the occult ever since I was young. My whole family is Cuban, and when I was a baby my grandparents were into &quot;Brujeria&quot;, (it is kind of like African voodoo) which is very popular in Cuban and other Hispanic cultures. I have always been very empathic as has my mother. When I was about 11 years old my aunt (mother's sister) and her two daughters (my cousin's) moved to Miami, FL (where we lived) from Cuba. When I was about 12 my mother decided she wanted to buy my cousin and I an Ouija board (the 1960's model) around Christmas time. We immediately brought it home and opened it and started messing with it on the kitchen table. Nothing really happened.
<br><br>
Time went by and my cousin and I stopped using it until we got really into it again like a year later. We started talking to a friendly spirit. We would ask her to do stuff to other people, and then the next day our friends would tell us that weird stuff happened to them. We thought it was the funniest thing ever. Anyway, we spoke to her pretty much everyday. We figured we had to give her a name so she said to call her Samantha. We asked her how old she was and her answer was &quot;-2&quot; we were like &quot;-2? When did you die?&quot; and she was all like &quot;I haven't&quot; and we were like &quot;?&quot;.  And she was like &quot;I haven't been born yet.&quot; We thought this was peculiar, but didn't give it much thought. She kept saying &quot;You know my mother, you know my mother. Take care of her, she is in trouble!&quot; We didn't know what she was talking about, but figured maybe she had us confused with some one else.
<br><br>
Well, shortly after that time period my aunt and my two cousins moved out. My aunt had an abusive boyfriend that was causing trouble and my mother was fed up with the drama so she told her she either had to leave him or get out. Guess what she chose? Yea, she moved out. So we didn't talk to them for a couple of years because she was still with him and we didn't want to be involved. Anyway, my aunt (whose tubes were tied) ended up having a baby and guess what they named her? You got it, Samantha! Now, imagine a full blown Cuban family with child names like Chabely and Misleidys. A name like Samantha is VERY out of place. When I spoke to my cousin about this she was totally freaked out. She had forgotten about the whole Ouija board event and immediately remembered. Now, let me tell ya...this child is very weird. I had only met her once when she was a baby, and when I came back home and saw her again she was about 4 and she remembered me? I didn't understand this. She even knew my name and I was not around her enough for a 4 year old to remember my name. It still boggles my mind!
<br><br>
In conclusion, I know this story sounds a bit hard to believe but it is the God's honest truth and it STILL freaks me out. I totally believe that we can communicate with paranormal things through the Ouija board. I am definitely convinced; this was WAY MORE than just a coincidence!
