Kris Tea sent me the following information about the Witch's Ball at Memphis Cemetery:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I heard about the witch's ball when my parents moved to Columbus, Michigan.  One day I asked my brother about the local ghost legends of the area. He mentioned the witch's ball. He told me that there is a large marble ball associated to the grave of an alleged witch. The gravestone here is very similar to the one found in Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Ohio.  It resides in Memphis, Michigan. It's a large marble ball set on a stone stand. I haven't found much actual data regarding that story besides this taken from the <a href="http://theshadowlands.net/places/michigan.htm" target="_blank">Shadowlands website</a>:
<br><br>
Memphis - Memphis Cemetery - If you take M-19 (Van Dyke Rd.) and follow it through Richmond to Memphis, the cemetery is on the right side. It is a small cemetery, but there is a narrow dirt road that runs through. At the very back center of the cemetery there is a huge black marble stone called the &quot;witch's ball.&quot; If you get close enough you can see faces and shadows in the stone, just like a crystal ball. Voices have been heard and apparitions have been seen there too.
<br><br>
In other accounts of this story there have been instances of orbs being seen in some pictures, which can easily be explained by the large amount of cottonwood trees in the area. In addition, many people are probably seeing their own reflections in the stone, since I have seen no images proving otherwise. The stories are very similar. Both stories probably play off the fear of witches, and the fact that the gravestones both resemble the crystal balls used by many witches just adds the facility of these stories. I've also heard it said that the one in Memphis has been seen rotating on its stand.
<br><br>
I even made a trip out there to see the alleged witch's ball in Memphis, MI. My friends and I went there during the day and night. We didn't feel anything coming from there at those times, but the other graves around it were more active. If you do go there, please do not park your car near this set of graves but in the new section, because it upsets some of the residents in the older section near the witch's ball here. Also, the stone is not in the middle back as mentioned on the Shadowlands, it's on the right hand side in the back.</i></blockquote>
