On February 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Shelby about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Shelby, and a few years back, my friend Yelena told me her house was haunted. That night, Yelena allowed myself and two other girls to sleep over. In the night, I started hitting the girl next to me, waking two girls up. They said I pointed to something, and they saw a shadow. In the morning, lighters were on a coffee table in front of us, randomly.
<br><br>
A different time at Yelena's house, we decided to pull out a ouija board. We were talking to the same spirit, I believe his name was Tom. He had told us he liked to kill birds for fun. We laughed, and asked him if they were spirit birds. He replied, no. Afterwards, he told us he choked these birds. The next day, about four birds were all over her yard, dead, without blood.
<br><br>
Yelena's house was built by her father, and they had a dirt basement, which she never went into. Just for thrills, we decided to go down the ladder into it. When I was going down, something grabbed my foot, and I fell and scraped my arm pretty bad...We left right away.
<br><br>
One other time, Yelena and I decided to use a ouija board. This time, we had candles set up. We asked, &quot;Who are we talking to,&quot; and the board spelled out &quot;death.&quot; And we asked, &quot;Are you here to take someone?&quot;  It said, &quot;No, protect.&quot; We asked who it was protecting us from, and the board spelled out &quot;satan.&quot; We turned off the candles, and put the board away.
<br><br>
These stories are all eerie, and very true.
