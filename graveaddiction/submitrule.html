I welcome anyone to submit photos of cemeteries, possible ghosts, or historical structures/parks to the site...in fact, I encourage it!  I will gladly display these images, giving full credit to the contributor.  However, I do have a few guidelines to help make this process easier for me.  If you have trouble with a few of the rules, don't worry...I won't reject your contributions!  I am just trying to prevent people from sending excessive amounts of large photos (for example, excessive = more than 30 photos for a single cemetery from a single contributor!)
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Please note that each contributor may use up to 15MB of space on my site.  I haven't enforced this rule prior to August 2006, but due to increasing space usage I have decided to enforce this limit.<br><br>
<li>When you <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">e-mail</a> your photos to me, please let me know who I should give credit to.  This can be your first name, your first and last name, a screenname, or you can remain anonymous.  It is VERY important that you let me know this, or I will not post your photos.<br><br>
<li>If possible, please resize your image to make it small enough for the website.  Some photos I've received have been 500KB+.  I don't mind resizing them myself, but it makes it SO much easier when the photos are 150KB or less.<br><br>
<li>Also, please limit the number of photos you send.  I typically post 20-30 photos per location, sometimes more for larger cemeteries and structures.  Please don't send 50+ photos for a single cemetery/location - it's pretty safe to assume I won't post all of them if you do.<br><br>
<li>Another thing that <b>really</b> helps me out is including titles with your photos.  I need a title to display in the dropdown list for every photo, and sometimes I'm just not sure what title to use.  If you could send me a very short description (or title) for each photo, I'd truly appreciate it!<br><br>
<li>It also helps if you can provide the city, state, and country (if outside of the US) for each location you send.<br><br>
<li>If sending me your photos via postal mail, you won't have to worry about size of course, but please include the information regarding location, name, and titles mentioned above.  Also, please be sure to let me know if you need me to mail the photos back.  If I do need to mail them back, please make sure you include your return address (printed neatly so I can read it).
</ol>
<br>
Thanks so much for helping me make this process a little easier! :)
