On November 13, 2006 I received an e-mail from Sabrina about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This is all true...My friend and I (Sabrina) went out and bought a board because we didn't believe that it worked. So we went out to WalMart and we bought one.  Our boyfriends thought that we were crazy, so we went to her house and we lit some candles.
<br><br>
We asked if anyone was there, and it told us yes. So we kept asking it questions.  Then we asked a specific question because her daughter had said that she plays with a girl who is dead.  We asked if it was true, and it said yes - that the girl was in the house right now.  Next thing we know, the water in the kitchen turned on...THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE HOUSE WITH US! It was crazy.
<br><br>
We have had alot of stuff happen to us when we have been playing with it. One night we were talking on it, and the next thing I know it was telling us that we needed to leave her house because her boyfriend was on his way to the house to hurt her. We didn't believe it, so we kept on talking on the board.  It just kept telling us to leave. Well, the board was correct, because he was on his way until he got pulled over right down the road from her house.  He told her the next day that he was on his way over there and that he was going to hurt her.
<br><br>
We still play on it, but we are always very careful of what we ask and where we play it at because so much stuff has happened to us. I never believed in it until I played it for the first time. So be careful what you ask, because we have asked questions that we shouldn't have and it was really hard for us to get rid of the spirits.
