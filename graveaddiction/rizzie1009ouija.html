On October 29, 2009 I received an e-mail from Rizzie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Session 1
<br><br>
Are there any spirits in the room that wish to speak to me?<br>
YES<br>
<br>
Hello spirit, can you please tell me your name?<br>
E<br>
<br>
Does it start with an e? If so, can you keep spelling it?<br>
(goes to w)<br>
<br>
So its E-W-(goes to r) EWR - are those your initials? (goes to C)<br>
<br>
Keep going.<br>
<br>
(moves into the very top center of the board, over the logo 'Ouija Mystical Oracle'<br>
<br>
You're pointing to the center of the board. Does this have any certain meaning? Are you telling me to 'see' (C) ouija?<br>
YES<br>
<br>
I'm sorry. What is the specific reason behind this? Can you spell it out for me?<br>
O 1 (moves in between 5 and 6, dead center at the bottom of the board)<br>
<br>
5 and 6. What does this mean, can you keep going on?<br>
(moves up the center of the board in a straight line, planchette landing back on the ouija logo)<br>
<br>
Are you trying to tell me something about the ouija board?<br>
YES<br>
<br>
Can you tell me if there is anything bad about it?<br>
B S U NO (I interpreted this as bullshit, you know)<br>
<br>
Are you saying that I know what's wrong with the ouija board already?<br>
YES<br>
<br>
[I pause a moment] Would you like to tell me, because I'm not sure we have the same thoughts?<br>
H U (it started making it's way towards the moon, so I was nervous, because my thought was a demon had posessed the board. Suddenly, my camera beeped and shut off, stopping the recording and scaring me half to death.)<br>
<br>
Goodbye. (I quickly flipped the board over and turned the lights on)<br>
<br>
As I was changing the batteries in my camera, it had occured to me that I never asked the spirit if they wanted to be recorded. They were probably angry because they knew I was recording the session.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, I flipped the board back and tried again.<br>
<br>
Hello, if the same spirit from before is here, I would like to speak to you and apologize.<br>
GOODBYE<br>
<br>
So I felt pretty bad about that!<br>

<br><br>

Session 2
<br><br>

Right now I am also extremely sick with a bad case of bronchitis. Its not lethal, but the reason I'd taken out the board was to see if any of the spirits knew anything about it.  After going upstairs and changing my camera's batteries, I sat with the camera not recording, in my lap.<br><br>

Are there any other spirits in the room who can talk to me and help me?<br>
pointed to the sun, which I assumed was a yes<br>
<br>
Thank you. Would you mind being recorded?<br>
NO<br>
<br>
I scooted myself close to the board and dropped the camera right under the board.  I then pushed the record button with my thumb, without taking my hands off the planchette.<br>
<br>
Hello spirit, do you know that I am sick right now?<br>
F E F S -<br>
<br>
(I stopped them mid sentence) Is that the name of a sickness or something? (dunno why I thought that)<br>
U H-<br>
<br>
(my dad called downstairs and interrupted me) &quot;Hold on a moment, OK&quot; (talking to dad)<br>
<br>
Sorry.<br>
U H G (like ugh)<br>
<br>
Are you saying that because I keep getting interupted?<br>
YES<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry about that. Do you know when I will get better?<br>
N 3 R D E 7 W T<br>
<br>
Is any of this pertaining to my sickness?<br>
7<br>
<br>
Are you saying I'm going to be sick for 7 days?<br>
B O P M Y<br>
<br>
Do you know anything that can help me cure my sickness faster?<br>
U T S D P E YES<br>
<br>
Spirit, you're not making any sense.  I'm sorry, do you know anything about my sickness?  If so, please point to the YES.<br>
(nothing)<br>
<br>
If you can tell me how many days I will be sick, please point to the numbers on the number line. If you can not, please go to the NO.<br>
stopped at the 2 slightly, but went to GOODBYE.<br>
<br>
So that didn't help much. But it was pretty cool!
