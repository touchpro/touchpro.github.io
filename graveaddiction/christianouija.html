On July 18, 2007 I received an e-mail from Christian L. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
One day I was just rollerblading with my friend, and he wanted to show me this website (It was fake, but I didn't know). Well, when my friend would type this stuff would come up, like an online spirit. Like you put in a petition and then a question. But only when he typed the stuff, it worked. When I typed, it just said stuff like your spiritual link is getting better, and then thingd like I will sleep under your bed tonight, or someone is waiting outside for you. Then my friend was typing stuff (for the answer)...like go to the theater, turn off the lights, look behind you, stand up. So well onto the ouija board story.
<br><br>
A few friends and I were doing the ouija board, and we were saying stupid stuff like when am I going to get married and such. Well, here it is:
<br><br>
Me: Do you like us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old am I?<br>
Board: 13<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 3<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: Boating accident<br>
<br>
Me: Who was driving the boat?<br>
Board: John<br>
<br>
Me: How old is John?<br>
Board: 0<br>
<br>
Me: Can we go for a little bit?<br>
Board: Yes...<br>
<br>
Around an hour later we come back.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like peteranswers.com?  (A fake spirit website)<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know who made it?<br>
Board: Daniel (One of my good friends)<br>
<br>
Me: Daniel?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you say Daniel?<br>
Board: Cause I want to hurt him<br>
<br>
Me: Hurt him?<br>
Board: Gun<br>
<br>
Me: What?!?<br>
Board: Kill Daniel<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: Giana (Some girl from school)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like me?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: Is something wrong?<br>
Board: Rising spirits<br>
<br>
Me: What are rising spirits?<br>
Board: Taller spirits<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to hurt Daniel?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How<br>
Board: Burn<br>
<br>
Me: Can I leave please?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: My brother comes in and says can we leave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: So we flip the glass over<br>
<br>
The next day I see Daniel, and he had burn marks all over his shoulders, legs, and stomach. When I got back, I threw away all the paper and just got rid of it.
