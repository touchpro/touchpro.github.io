On September 3, 2006 I received an e-mail from Tammy Schaeffer about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Hi, my name is Tammy Schaeffer. Me and a few friends (Nick, Beckie, Ellie, and Ellie's brother, Derik) wanted to &quot;play&quot; with the board. We lit four candles and started to ask questions.  We eventually contacted Rusty, a 54 year old man.  We talked to him for awhile...then my grandpa came through.  I cried so much, and then I went online to check myspace (a website that rocks!).  Suddenly I felt a cold draft around me. I asked Nick if he had opened a window he said no, so I was like uhh ok then! I heard a voice call my name, and I thought I was going crazy (I was tired as hell).
<br><br>
After we got done with the board, we went to this place that is haunted - the Middletown Reservoir.  The story goes that a young girl had died there, so we went into the woods and heard a little girl scream.  I have anxiety attacks so I couldn't deal with that shit...Nick held my hand because he knows when I'm about to have one. Suddenly a little girl was running after us, and all I could think was &quot;God, I'm going to die.&quot; We got out of the woods, and I have this thing where I can talk to spirits.  The girl from the woods talked to me and said if we ever go into the woods again, someone would kill us. I need someone I could talk too about this stuff.  One question...My candle is lit and it is flickering. How can I ask if a spirit is trying to contact me?
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Tammy, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll send your advice on to her.
