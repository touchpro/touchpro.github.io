On October 27, 2005 I received an e-mail from Maddy Larsen with a follow-up story to her last <a href="dlarsouija.html">ouija experience</a>:
<br><br><br>
&quot;We used the Ouija board again, this time with JT, Audra, and I. We did it outside on my porch, and what scared me the most was that when we asked if anyone was there it became really...still. The trees that had been previously a bit active as the wind ruffled their leaves seemed to freeze in time. 
<br><br>
The person it was most active for was Audra. Our fingers weren't touching the planchette, as when we had all done it
before.  We kept questioning who was pushing it and the heightened fingers just seemed to make us a bit more able to believe in it. At any rate, we had a few candles on the table, it was a glass table outside. After about 10 minutes JT asked if it was evil. I don't know why he did it, but he just did. He had never believed Audra and I about the Smokey
Face in my attic room, so he was quite amazed when it became extremely windy and all of the candles began to blow out until only one was left.
<br><br>
This will really surprise you - you see, we had a bunch of candles left over from the previous Halloween...and one was a gift from Audra. This was on my birthday, mind you. It was a tall, thick, black candle she had found at a store. Surprisingly, it was entirely black, not one of the cheap ones with just a layer of black paint on the outside and
completely white on the inside. It didn't really answer, so JT asked again. Now I was freaking out. I imagine they were as well, considering Audra kept staring around with wide eyes and saying she heard something. I don't know how she heard something when all I could really hear (besides them talking) was the wind. By now it had begun howling when JT had asked the second time. The candle flame grew really long and then went out. When the smoke began to dissipate I swear I saw that same face as last time! Of course we put up the board, and after they left the next day I ripped it to pieces.&quot;
