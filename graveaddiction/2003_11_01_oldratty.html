		<div class="content">I know I am a cat, but it happens to us too:  Blogstipation!  I have been stopped up and unable to blog and I just don't understand.<br /><br />Let me try to bring you up to date.  Mommy has been better at cleaning my litter box but she still spends too much time working, going to school and going out with that Mike guy.  She needs to dump him and spend more time with me.  I am more understanding and loveable and all it takes to keep me happy is a clean place to take a dump and a full food dish with Pounce for dessert.  I try to make her understand but she sees something in him.  Okay, he is pretty good at face scratches but she doesn't even like her face scratched...whatever, someday maybe she will realize that I should be first in her life!!!<br /><br />Mommy's mommy is being herself.  Always talking about those people with their heads up their asses, always saying 4 more years until retirement, always looking for a reason to stay home and not go to work.  Mommy's mommy says she is just too old, fat and tired to deal with the BS of corporate America.  I think she is funny and makes me laugh.  She was babysitting me the other night and was so stressed just to shut me up she kept giving me POUNCE.  I bet I got 1/2 a can out of her that night.  I can really yowl when I choose and that gets on her nerves!!  Mommy's daddy pretty much sits and holds those deformed, smellie creatures.  I think bathtime is coming soon, definitely before the holidays!  Mommy's daddy did get a new lawn tractor, it has 25 horses...I have been looking out the window and not seen one horse but he is happy.  The tractor is big and red and has a snow blade.  He says he is too old to be shoveling snow....well duh, I don't see any snow.  Guess he is planning in advance.  Oh, that is another thing, mommy's mommy thinks she is a bear because her legs are hairy and she thinks she should hibernate now that she is fat enough.  I think she should stop eating more than a starving third world country at a buffet and shave those big beefy legs!<br /><br />Beth the Brutal has been around some, giving me Pounce, scratching my face, pissing me off and making me growl and shed...she hasn't changed a bit.  Guess she is running around with a new person, Kate, who is a little gothic.  Well I like black and if she wants to wear it fine with me.  Mommy's mommy likes her so she must be ok except she has a dog...guess it is cute (cute dog, not sure about that) and really likes her dog.  They are going ghost hunting tonight, why would anyone want to hunt a ghost, like really, once you find one what are you going to do with it???<br /><br />Max the Mangler is getting very bad at biting the other mutants.  I really don't care but he is constantly be screamed at and it disturbs my naps.  Another thing, they have a full food bowl and God forbid that Daddy ever let it go empty plus everytime they take a piss or shit outside they get rewarded with various snackies.  So why do those SOBs (they really are sons of bitches you know) have to eat my food and drink my water!!!????  Duh, my bowl is always empty and dirty, those hogs.  I would take a nice stinky dump in their bowl but heck, they think that is a real treat and would fight over it.  I am not sure how to stop this stealing of food.  Right now I just eat as fast and much as I can.  A girl does what she must.<br /><br />Oh yeah, how could I forget, happened a week ago and everyone still talks about it even though it was a one time event....Max caught a mouse.  Big whoop!  I have killed.  His was still alive.  Of course they had to take it away from the dumbass before he ate it and then puked mouse parts all over the carpet.  Mommy's mommy would have cussed until there was a blue haze over the house.  Anyway, Max caught a mouse...talk about that for weeks.<br /><br />Well, best I go on about my business.  Their work day is almost done and I need to nap before they get home.</div><br>
