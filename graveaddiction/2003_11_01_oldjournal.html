Hope you all had a FANTASTIC Thanksgiving!!!!  Mine was good, my mom made a great dinner... Mmmmm, broccoli cheese casserole! :)<br /><br />I bought a new computer Wednesday afternoon after work.  I thought about waiting until today, but I absolutely hate battling the after Thanksgiving crowds, and I got a really good deal on the computer at Best Buy...I didn't see anything comparable to this one in the ads any cheaper.  My old computer was an IBM Thinkpad that I bought on November 19, 1999.  The new computer is a Compaq desktop, it's a Pentium 4, 120GB hard drive, etc...I really do love it!  I always thought I'd love having a laptop, but I've got to admit that I like desktops better.  I've got a lot to catch up on...blogging, website updates, and working on the Fisher Catholic High School Alumni newsletter that I need to have put together by the end of the month!<br /><br />Tonight I went to Meijer, mainly because I was bored.  While I was there I decided to look at Christmas trees.  I hadn't put one up for the past two years (because my old one kept falling down!).   I was surprised and found a really good deal...a 6 1/2 foot, slim, pre-lit tree (multi-colored lights) for only $29.99!!!  That's like an after Christmas sale!  So I just finished up decorating it.  It's nice to be able to display my Snoopy ornaments again....and the Mothman ornament!  I'll have to take some photos of it and post them, it looks really nice.<br /><br />Well, I have to clean up the mess I made while digging the Christmas ornaments out of the closet.  Perhaps I'll blog again tomorrow!<br><br>

My computer crashed on Sunday, I'm devastated!  So until it's fixed or I get a new one, I probably won't be updating the blog often...but hopefully I'll have a new computer by the end of the week!<br><br>

My teeth are <i>perfect</i>...no cavities!!!  I had this awful feeling before going to the dentist that I would have at least two cavities, so I was relieved when he said it was a perfect checkup.  Also, I asked about my wisdom teeth (my little sister had her wisdom teeth out last year) and he said it looks like I'll be able to keep them!  They're tiny, but they're all the way in.  They're straight and they're not overcrowding my mouth...unless I'd get a big cavity he said there is no reason why I should get them pulled.  That was REALLY good news! :)<br /><br />My appointment was at 1:40PM, but I didn't get back to go back until 2:00PM.  Then it was 2:30 before Dr. Neff was able to see me.  I said I'd be back to work in Dublin by 3:30...my dentist is in Lancaster.  Yes, yes...I know that's a long drive and I should find someone closer, I just haven't gotten around to doing so.  For those of you not from the Central Ohio area, it's about 45 miles from the building I work in to my dentist's office...it's an estimated 58 minute drive time according to mapquest.  And for once, that's a pretty accurate estimate.  It took me about 55 minutes to make it down there.  I didn't leave the dentist's office until 2:55PM.  So yeah, I had to drive like a bat out of hell to make it back to work by 3:30 (and yes, I did manage to make it back on time).<br /><br />Anyway, now I'm exhausted.  But at least my teeth are clean and shiny...I love that feeling!! :)<br><br>

Ugh, today I have to go to the dentist.  Just a cleaning, here's hoping I don't have any cavities!  Really, the going to the dentist isn't all that bad, I shouldn't complain.  My appointment is in the middle of the day, so I'll have to leave work and then come back.  <br /><br />Last night was pretty uneventful.  I had an awful headache after work (not sure why, it was a good day), so I laid around most of the night wishing it would go away.  Finally around 8:00PM I decided to take Excederin PM, one of the few medicines that knock me out.  I slept really good last night as a result, but I had some strange dreams.  In one of the dreams I was in some sort of testing competition...a bunch of testers were gathered from all sorts of different companies, and we had to test some new software.  Whoever found the most defects won.  Thank god it was just a dream, I'd hate to be in a competition like that!!!  Wonder why I'd dream about testing?  Maybe I've been too stressed out at work lately...the only times I dream about work are times when I'm stressed.  <br /><br />I also had a dream that I was hunting in the woods behind my grandma's old house (which is interesting since I've never gone hunting before).  It was dark and something was stalking me.  It was kind of scary.  Luckily I had Cherokee with me (the dog my parents had to put to sleep last January...I remember blogging about how they didn't tell me they put him to sleep, I found out a week later).  It made me feel better in the dream, but honestly, I don't think Cherokee would have been much protection.  He was a Golden Retriever, and they're not too ferocious!  Maybe he would have licked the stalker to death?  Anyway, that's about all I remember from that dream.<br /><br />I still haven't had a chance to work on the photos from last Friday's ghost hunt.  Maybe I'll get a chance to work on them some tonight.<br><br>

I know everyone complains about spam in their inboxes so I'm not saying anything new, but I feel like whining anyway...<br /><br />I HATE spam e-mails with subjects like &quot;I have a question&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;I need your help&quot;, etc.  I get a lot of real e-mails with subject lines like those from people who visit the site.  Therefore, I open must of those because I never know if it's going to be about a cemetery/haunted place or whether it's going to be about.  So I'm thinking that I may have to put a little disclaimer on the site telling people to make their subject lines as descriptive as possible, or I'll delete them.  <br /><br />Another spam related thing that I hate...now I'm getting it in my guestbook.  It's happened twice, the last time was this past Sunday.  I log into my e-mail and find 30 e-mails with the subject "new guestbook entry".  I got all excited since I love it when people sign the GB, but then I look at the entries and the entries are from people named Viagra, Ambien, Zoloft, etc.  So I had to log into the GB admin panel and delete those too.  I guess pretty soon they'll start attacking the <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/phpBB2/index.php">message board</a>.  <br /><br />I feel much better now that I've vented :)<br /><br />Less than an hour until the weekly team meeting...I can't wait (<i>said <b>very</b> sarcastically!</i>).<br><br>

First things first...I added two new blogs to my daily reading list:<br /><ol><br /><li><A HREF="http://home.columbus.rr.com/rubbertoe/blog.html" TARGET="_blank">The Toe Pages</A><br /><li><A HREF="http://the-material-kid.org/" TARGET="_blank">the-material-kid.org</A><br /></ol><br />I didn't get a chance to blog last night because I decided to clean.  Yes, I am a bit obsessive compulsive when it comes to stuff like cleaning.  I swept the patio on Sunday because all the wind we had last week covered it in leaves, and I managed to track leaves into my house.  I was feeling depressed on Sunday (I'm always depressed on Sunday because I know I have to go back to work the next day), so I didn't vacuum.  So anyway, I decided to vacuum last night, and I can't vacuum without dusting, etc.  So yeah, I got a bit carried away with the cleaning again.<br /><br />My weekend was a lot of fun.  Friday night I went to a ghost hunt at <a href="prospect.html">Prospect Place</a> with Kate.  We were the only two people that signed up for that night, so it was a really small group!  We explored the house with Randy, the paranormal investigator in charge of the Friday night hunts, and two other members of his group, Marsha and Joe.  I really had a great time!  I'm planning to add the new photos to the site later this week, maybe tomorrow or Thursday, along with a written description of my ghostly experiences there.<br /><br />Yesterday was our Thanksgiving Potluck at work.  It turned out pretty good.  I brought in a cream cheese ball (3 bars of cream cheese, 1 package Carl Budding Beef - chopped (I use the food processor), 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon Accent seasoning, and a few dashes of garlic powder.  Mix it all up and form into a ball).  I was afraid I might have put too much garlic in it, but I guess not since everyone loved it.  I didn't want to take it home (because I knew I'd eat it all night, that stuff is addicting!), so I left it at work.  This morning my coworker Sheri told me that she took it home with her, she just loved it.  It made me feel good to know that someone liked it so much that they took it home!<br /><br />Well, it's time for me to get to work.  I'll try to blog again tonight.<br /><br /><br><br>

I admit it, I've been slacking on my blogging again!  I'll go and ahead and write about everything that's been going on since I last blogged:<br /><br />Tuesday night I met my friend Kate in Worthington, and she took me to a cemetery off US-23 that I would have never knew existed.  It was a really interesting cemetery...you can see the photos I took by <a href="patters.html">clicking here</a>.  After we finished looking around the cemetery we went to Senior Antonios, a small Mexican restaurant not far from the cemetery.  Kate wasn't lying, it was <b>really</b> good!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  And if the cemetery and dinner wasn't enough fun, I also got to meet her dog, Cordy.  Cordy is absolutely adorable, I can see why she won first place at Petsmart's pet Halloween costume contest!<br /><br />I don't remember what I did Wednesday night.  I think I just read.  Oh yeah, and I downloaded all of the photos from the camera so I could make <a href="newstuff.html">this week's update</a>.  That's about it though.<br /><br />Yesterday was the best day I had experienced for a long time at work...of course, maybe that's because I was sort of only there for a half day.  We had our &quot;I Got Caught&quot; lunch.  We have these awards at work called &quot;I got caught&quot;, we can give them to each other when we &quot;catch&quot; them doing something good to help out the area.  Every quarter, people who have been caught get to go to a free lunch.  I left a little after 11 for that.  Then immediately after lunch my team was volunteering at the Foodbank.  That was fun too, I like working at the foodbank.  So really, it was like a half day since I was out of the office all afternoon.  It was sooooo nice!<br /><br />My sister spent the night with me last night, she spends the night at my place on Thursday since it's her late class.  She got out early last night though, so she was happy about that since she could watch all of her favorite TV shows.<br /><br />Tonight I'm going to another ghost hunt at <a href="prospect.html">Prospect Place</a>.  Kate is going with me, it should be a fun time!  I'll be sure to blog about it, but probably not until Monday since I'm so terrible about blogging on the weekends :)<br /><br />Well, here's hoping for another good day at work!<br><br>

Yesterday was a so-so day at work.  I had my headphones on most of the day, listening to the &quot;Stress Relief&quot; mix CDs I made for Chrissie a few months ago.  A little Slipknot always makes me feel better, and it blocks out all the talking :)  So I think I'll put my headphones on again today!<br /><br />Tonight I'm meeting Kate to go cemetery exploring.  And we're going to eat Mexican for dinner...it's only a quarter after six in the morning and it already sounds good!<br /><br />I don't remember the dream, but Sunday night I had a dream that involved an experience from my childhood.  Now I can't get the memory out of my head, and it makes me laugh everytime I think about it.  Let me warn you, at the time it wasn't so funny, but looking back it seems hilarious...in a sick, twisted sort of way.  I was probably 6 or 7, which means my sister was 4 or 5.  It was late spring/early summer and we were playing out in the yard while my dad was mowing and my mom was working in a flower bed.  We lived out in the country, so often we'd see rabbits when we mowed the grass, especially baby rabbits whose nests were disturbed/destroyed.  Well, that day Katy and I saw a cute, fluffy little bunny.  We yelled for our mom so she could come over and see it too.  Since dad was mowing in that area of the yard mom told us to chase the bunny into the bushes on the side of the house so it'd be safe.  Katy ran after it and she succeeded in chasing the cute little bunny into the bushes.  She was so proud of herself for saving it.  Not even a minute later, we heard a terrible shriek from the bushes, and out came a stray cat that had been hanging around...with the bunny in it's mouth!!!  So much for chasing it to safety, huh?!  Katy started crying, it was awful.  My mom felt bad too, because she was the one who told us to chase it into the bushes.  I think I'll always have the picture of that tragedy in my head, and I can't help but laugh!  I mean, who would have thought a cat would be waiting for it?!  Anyway, now you all probably think I've justified my blog's title, right? :)<br /><br />Well, time for me to get ready for work.  Here's hoping it's a decent day!<br><br>

The weekend went way too fast.  I'm so depressed that it's Monday and time to go back to work.<br /><br />Friday I got up early and was at work an hour early.  I wasn't expecting to run into anyone else for at least an hour, but wouldn't you know it...I was "attacked" before I even sat down at my desk.  I hate it when people start bugging me before I even have my PC turned on.  And it's especially annoying when the person who attacks me read my daily status that I sent the night before...did he really think I'd have anything new to report already???  Oh well.<br /><br />So being at work an hour early isn't my favorite, but it is nice to leave earlier.  But did I get to leave earlier on Friday?  Of course not!  In fact, I was stuck here an hour later than my normal leave time!  Of course, my coworkers gave me a hard time for staying late, they told me I should just refuse to have a meeting so late.  And when I said that sometimes you have to do things like stay late, they told me I was &quot;young and naive&quot;.  That kind of pissed me off.  So yeah, if I stayed late I'd hear about it from my coworkers, and if I left I'd hear about it from my managers and IT Process & Governance.  But I'll stop complaining.  Staying late did help find a workaround for one of the strange things I've encountered with the automated testing tool.  And Mercury is going to take a look at the problem and see if they can find a solution.  <br /><br />My weekend was fun.  Friday night I got home from work and crashed.  I ended up falling asleep on the couch while watching TV.  That never happens, so I was definitely tired.  Saturday I went to lunch with my parents and visited a couple cemeteries.  I got some really good photos of a zinc angel statue.  I'll post them on the site later this week.  Yesterday I swept the patio and did a little cleaning around the house.  And that's about it.  It wasn't the most exciting weekend, but it was nice to catch up on sleep!<br><br>

I remembered something that I forgot to write about last night.<br /><br />Lina's plant at work has a really bad case of what we thought were spider mites.  I did some research on the internet though, and I think her plant has been invaded by Mealy Bugs, not spider mites.  I tried to take some photos at work yesterday, but they didn't turn out as clear as I would have liked.  So here's some photos I found on the following sites:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/OMAFRA/english/crops/facts/88-119.htm" target="_blank">http://www.gov.on.ca/OMAFRA/english/crops/facts/88-119.htm</a><br /><br /><a href="http://pub125.ezboard.com/ftestsite16428frm20?page=2" target="_blank">http://pub125.ezboard.com/ftestsite16428frm20?page=2</a><br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/MealyLarge.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/Mealy.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./miscpic/Mealy2.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./miscpic/mealybug1.jpg"></center><br /><br />Pretty disgusting, aren't they?  The bugs on her plant are small, but they are big enough that you can see their little legs move.  Lina has been treating the plant for several weeks now, and they just won't go away!<br><br>

My day at work wasn't quite as bad as yesterday, which is a relief.  I think tomorrow might be a bad day though.  Why do I think that?  I had a bunch of problems to report with the QuickTest Pro software in my daily status.  I have a feeling people (leads and managers) may overreact again, causing a stressful day for me.  At least I'm ready for it this time!<br /><br />I went to buy <i>Finding Nemo</i> after work tonight.  I tell ya, my video collection must be pretty strange...bunches of horror/mystery movies with the occasional cartoon mixed in.  You know, I think <i>Finding Nemo</i> might be the last movie I saw in a theater.  I don't go to the movies too often, I just wait til they come out on DVD or HBO.  The next movie I'm definitely going to see is the final <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie...I HAVE to see that in the theatre, and I can't wait until it comes out!  <br /><br />I didn't do anything else interesting today.  I think a few coworkers and I are going to go to lunch tomorrow.  If not tomorrow, we're going Thursday.  Lina had a craving for Chili's, and it sounded good to the rest of us too.  Mmmmm, I can't wait.<br /><br />Nothing else really happened today.  I can't believe it's only Tuesday, it feels like it should at least be Thursday!<br><br>

Well, today was one of the most stressful days I've had at work for some time now.  Mark, if you're reading this you won't believe the next thing I'm going to write - today almost reminded me of a day on Project Focus, it was really that terrible!  Some of you may remember my post from 10/27, when I said that the one-on-one meetings I had with my division manager and systems officer made me feel better?  Today made me feel the total opposite, I heard something <b>totally</b> different than what I was told not even two weeks ago...from the very same people!!  But as usual, I won't go into the details since my coworker Michelle and I have a suspicion that some of my other coworkers and maybe even my manager read my blog.  Maybe I need to start up a new, secret blog...just so I can vent about work more :)  Nah, one blog is more than enough!<br /><br />I think it's about time for me to host another ouija party.  I have a couple new boards that I haven't tried out yet, and it's been a couple months since the last time everyone got together to contact the dead.  I may have to send out an e-mail tomorrow to see who's interested.  I know Amanda is, she's always ready to play with the ouija board.  I guess Ryan was telling my mom at work today that he wants me to have another one too.<br /><br />You know what, I forgot to write about the Fisher Catholic Alumni Association!  Fisher Catholic is the high school I went to, I graduated in 1997.  Well, there has been an interest in revitalizing the alumni association, and I managed to get included.  The first meeting was last Thursday.  There was a guy from the class of '39, a guy from the class of '69, a guy from the class of '73, me from '97, a guy from the class of '02, a guy from the current senior class, and the parent of some alumni who graduated in the 80's-90's.  It was a long meeting, almost three hours.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had a fun time!  And I got volunteered to be the newsletter editor...I'm sure I'll have lots of interesting stories to tell once I start doing that :)  <br /><br />That's about it for tonight.  I'll blog again tomorrow, and hopefully I won't have anymore complaints about work (I'm keeping my fingers crossed!).<br><br>

OK, I <i>swear</i> that I'll start blogging on a regular basis again!  October is over, and the e-mails regarding stuff on the site have already started to slow down again.  I can't even begin to tell you how many e-mails I sent with directions to haunted places last month!<br /><br />My weekend was nice.  I really didn't do anything too exciting.  Friday night I stayed at home and kept wishing that I'd get over the awful cold I had last week.  It was weird, my wishing must have paid off because I felt much better on Saturday.  I got up early and met my family for breakfast on Saturday morning, then I went to a couple cemeteries.  Saturday was an ugly day, very rainy and gray.  While I was taking pictures at the second cemetery I visited, it started to rain.  It was a big cemetery, and I had parked the truck at the back...I was drenched by the time I walked back.  My pictures turned out decent though, I was afraid I'd have water spots all over them from rain getting on the lens while I was taking them, but it didn't.  Then I went to my parents house and we went out for lunch.  We went to Meijer afterwards to see what Halloween decorations were left...I love stocking up on holiday decorations for next year when they're on sale.  I got this cool little plush grim reaper toy for the bathroom with the cemetery theme.  When I went to cut the tags off I discovered that it's a dog toy!  So yeah, now I'm using dog toys to decorate with :)  Oh well!<br /><br />Today I've just been cleaning.  I just cleaned on Wednesday, so nothing is really dirty...I just like cleaning.   Maybe I am a bit of a neat freak.  I slept in <i>really</i> late today, 11AM, that was VERY nice!  Then I watched TV for a bit.  Tonight I've been depressed thinking about going back to work.  And that's about it.<br /><br />This week I honestly am going to try to blog every day, except Saturday since I rarely ever blog then.  <br /><br />Hope everyone had a great weekend!<br><br>
