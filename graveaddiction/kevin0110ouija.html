On January 2, 2010 I received an e-mail from Kevin about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Myself and my very very good friend, Jacqueline, are very interested in the paranormal. I asked her a month or two ago what she thought of Ouija Boards, and she said she's tried one once, but it didn't work because she didn't really have an open mind about it. After that conversation, I began to do A LOT of research on Ouija Boards/Talking Boards and getting instructions and tips on how to properly use them. So, yesterday (December 31st), I went to hang out with that same friend and another friend of mine who also believes in the paranormal. At this point I was just urging to try it out. I had a bunch of information compiled in my mind on how to use the Ouija board both correctly and safely. The one other friend, Sarah, owns a Ouija board, so I decided to take the opportunity and suggest that we go and try it out! They were both good with the idea, and were also a bit excited. So, we went over to Sarah's house and got ready. I told them what we needed to do to get set up and some warnings for during the session. Here's a quick list of what we did to prepare for the session:
<br><br>
-Turned off ALL electricity in the room/area, including cell phones and other portable electronics.<br>
-Closed the blinds and partly opened them.<br>
-Lit a white candle and sat it next to us.<br>
-Placed a silver necklace on the board.<br>
-Got Sarah a notebook and writing utensil to record.<br>
-All gave a prayer for protection.<br>
-I prayed over the board.<br>
-Jacqueline and I put our knees together and put the board on our laps (Not sitting cross legged).<br>
-Put our fingers on the planchette and circled around the board for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
(Session began at approximately 3:30 PM)<br>
<br>
And then the session began. Sadly I don't have the script of the session, Sarah has it. Since I am a male and Jacqueline is a female, which is what is the recommended pair for a Ouija session, I was looking forward to a promising session.
<br><br>
The first thing I asked was the obvious: &quot;Is there anyone here who would like to speak to us?&quot; I really wasn't expecting a quick response, and was thinking it would take a little while, but to my surprise, the planchette moved to &quot;Yes&quot; in maybe 5 seconds. We looked up at each other with a very surprised look on our faces. I assumed we were both thinking, &quot;Did you just move that?&quot; when really, neither of us had moved it at all. Next we asked it's name and it spelt out &quot;AGZ&quot; (Or something similar).  We were a bit confused, and asked if they would like to try again, and it moved to yes. If I recall correctly, it messed up again and we just continued on with another question. This time we asked for his age, and it spelled 18. We asked if they were a boy or a girl, and it was a boy. We asked if it was in high school, and it said yes. I then asked how many of them are there and they said 5. I asked if they were all trying to contribute, and it said yes. This most likely explains the gibberish. I then asked if ONE of them could spell out their name, and they said yes and I told them to go ahead. It then proceeded to spelling out &quot;D E E.&quot; We asked if her name was Dee, and she said yes. We asked how old she was, and she said 5. We then asked her some questions, one being if they played any sports, the answer being baseball, and another being if they liked talking to us, the answer being yes, although I forget the other few, but eventually we got another person to spell out their name. We requested the 18-year-old, and it spelled out &quot;A L E X.&quot; We asked their favorite book, and it came out something like &quot;BELGARJ.&quot; We asked if they were all contributing again, and they said yes. After a few more questions, we weren't able to think of any more questions and we asked if it would like to say anything. It said yes, and then moved to goodbye. After that, we said goodbye and thank you and closed the board by flipping it and the planchette over, verbally &quot;closing the gate,&quot; and blowing out the candle. We then said another prayer and were done.
<br><br>
After the session we were all very excited and surprised. We had had a successful Ouija session! We decided that we definitely had to have another one soon.
<br><br>
Anyway, that's my first ever Ouija experience! Just remember, when it comes to Ouija, safetly always comes first! Study up before you try! It's not just a game!
