On December 28, 2006 I received an e-mail from Nikki M. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Nikki and I'm 15 years old! I played with the ouija board for the first time ever just a few days ago. Here is my story:
<br><br>
Just a few days ago, I bought an Ouija board because I thought they were the coolest things...and well, I still do!! But me and my friend Tanesha were playing with the ouija board for the first time and everything went ok!! Well, the next night we wanted answers to questions so we turned out the lights.  The first question we asked was &quot;Are you the portal to hell?&quot; The board said &quot;Yes,&quot; and then half of the board turned RED!! Me and Tanesha were thinking HOLY CRAP!!
<br><br>
Later on that night, after we put the board away, we were watching television and all of the sudden we felt cold chills cover our bodies. Then we got up and the kitchen door was standing wide open. Usually the only way that my door will stay open like that is if you put something up against it, and the only way it will open is if you open it yourself!! I think it was a sign!! Well, my mom made me throw it away because she thinks they are evil, and because she hasn't had very good experiences with the ouija board either!! Even though I threw the board away, I still feel like something is following me! like there is a presence that surrounds me constantly and it just won't leave me alone!! Last night I could not sleep because it seemed like everytime I closed my eyes, I felt like something kept getting closer and closer!! I was so scared!! Then suddenly I got cold like the night the door opened, but worse!! I got my necklace with a cross on it, put it on and for some reason I felt safer!! Finally, I went to sleep, but I still feel like there is something here!!
<br><br>
Well the reason I wrote this is because I'm scared, and I don't know what to do.  I need help on how to feel like I'm not being followed again!!
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Nikki, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on to her.
