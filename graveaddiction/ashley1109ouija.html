On November 6, 2009 I received an e-mail from Ashley L. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I've known about Ouija boards for most of my life, and have always regarded them as anything but a game. Therefore, I've held a great deal of respect for them. I had my first Ouija experience earlier this year, which only added fuel to my already sparked interest and curiosity when it came to dealing with such matters. It wasn't by any means the most active session I'd heard of, and by far I have held quite a few active sessions after that first time. But all it took was that one time and my interest was hooked. I never once considered it to be a game, but the idea of the possibility of &quot;contact&quot; with the other realm was appealing, I have to admit, and yes, there was that certain level of excitement. I only held sessions with the people I trusted most and who had already had experience in that area.
<br><br>
After speaking with my thirteen year old sister, Lex, one afternoon, the subject of Ouija boards was brought into the mix of the other topics we were speaking about. She confessed that she had always been curious about the board, but had never wanted to take part in a session unless it was with someone she knew she could completely trust. I was hesitant to consider allowing her to experience it, but rather her do it with me as opposed to someone else and assuring that she knew it was not a game, was something that had to be taken seriously and was to be respected, I agreed to hold a session with her.
<br><br>
Several nights later, after I arrived home from work, Lex and I held our first Ouija session together, along with her friend J who was over for the night. I explained and stressed the rules as clearly as I could and assured that the two of them understood before we proceeded. That first session was more successful and active than I would have predicted. The spirit we contacted was rather benign in nature, but was also to a point distressed. Voice recorders were recording at all times during the session and we managed to capture a rather clear EVP begging for help that leads me to the above conclusion. Sessions held after that point were both successful whereas some were not.
<br><br>
A week or so passed and on a night that another of Lex's friends, Tas, was over, we decided to hold another Ouija session. The night started off as any other previous night that we'd held a session. We set up the board on the floor in Lex's bedroom and turned out the lights. With me on one side of the board, Lex and Tas sat across from me. We made several attempts of contact, but each contacted the same two spirits, an &quot;older gentleman&quot; and a &quot;young female child.&quot; Neither were willing to speak with us each time they came through the board, so we decided to take a short break and change the location.
<br><br>
Moving the board into Lex's bathroom a short while later, we started another session. After everything that happened, I realized that was one of our first big mistakes and something I feel so foolish to have overlooked in the first place. Immediately I could feel the change in atmosphere once the session had begun; the air almost seemed thick with negativity and my senses started going wild, especially with the energy I felt coming from the planchette moving across the board.
<br><br>
&quot;Are there any spirits present in the room with us?&quot; I questioned, to which the planchette slowly moved to &quot;Yes.&quot; Proceeding, I asked whether it was male or female (it answered 'M' for male) and then I asked if it could spell its name. I will not be sharing the name here and to this day refuse to speak it out loud.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the room continued to change and I started to get uneasy, but wishing not to startle both Lex and Tas, I kept my senses finely tuned into the situation and proceeded a little bit further. &quot;Can you please tell us your age?&quot; It would not give an answer, so I rephrased the question. &quot;Can you please tell us what year you were born?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;A very long time ago...&quot;
<br><br>
I heard it in my mind, clear as day, a voice that was not my own and was one that sounded &quot;male.&quot; My eyes snapped up to look at Lex and Tas, but they did not appear to have heard it. That's when my senses started pulling me in every direction with warning. I knew it was time to close the session off. The planchette then started moving on its own before I could mention to Lex and Tas that we were going to end the session.
<br><br>
&quot;V-e-u,&quot; it started to spell.
<br><br>
Lex looked at me, her face suddenly puzzled. &quot;View?&quot;
<br><br>
The planchette moved to &quot;Yes,&quot; to which it then immediately spelt, &quot;V-i-e-w *****.&quot;
<br><br>
My heart started to race and in my mind, visions of what was about take place started to slowly materialize. I realized suspicions I had been ignoring were being confirmed and I took authority. &quot;No, nobody is viewing anyone,&quot; I spoke firmly. &quot;We are here tonight to talk only, not to view. If you don't want to talk, then we are going to close the session.&quot;
<br><br>
The planchette quickly went to 'no' and started to spell, once again, &quot;V-i-e-w *****.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;We are going to say goodbye now,&quot; I stated, looking to Lex and Tas to make sure they understood, but the planchette zipped to 'no' a second time. &quot;We need to say goodbye,&quot; I stressed and together the three of us pushed the planchette to goodbye and Lex reached up to turn the light on.
<br><br>
My mind was racing as we sat there trying to catch our bearings. We briefly discussed what had happened when Lex asked what I thought we should do. I answered, &quot;Let's take the board back into your room for a while to give it a rest, and then we'll decide whether or not we want to give it another go.&quot; I had no intention of holding another session that night though.
<br><br>
Lex suddenly jolted and looked directly at me. &quot;Oh my God...&quot; she gasped. &quot;He is so pissed at you right now!&quot;
<br><br>
She proceeded to tell me she felt &quot;him&quot; breeze right through her when I suggested we move the board back into her room, and that she could hear &quot;him&quot; saying &quot;he&quot; was angry because I had told &quot;him&quot; no, that I had started something and &quot;he&quot; wanted it finished. Tas insisted we leave the bathroom and we stepped outside onto the back deck so I could smoke. Things started to go downhill at that point.
<br><br>
I was sitting in one of the chairs on the deck (which is extremely tiny) and Lex was sitting in the other chair, with a round table separating us while Tas remained standing. Suddenly Lex started to complain that &quot;he&quot; wouldn't leave her alone and &quot;he&quot; was really hurting her back. It got to the point where she was gripping the arms of the chair and arching forward, but she couldn't rise to her feet. Before I knew what was happening, I was at her side, my hand on her head, demanding that whoever &quot;he&quot; was, that &quot;he&quot; leave in the name of Jesus Christ and harm Lex no more. What was so entirely odd about that moment was that it was almost like I was standing off to the side watching myself do so; I didn't understand it. Once I was able to pull Lex up from the chair, I had her turn around and pull her tank top up in the back to check for any marks where she indicated the pain had originated from. In the middle of the small of her back was a red imprint of a hand, which I took a picture of on my cell phone. There were also scratches that appeared on the top left hand corner of her chest.
<br><br>
Fast forward a slight bit and we were back out on the back deck trying to figure out what we were going to do. Lex was being terrorized by &quot;him&quot; and we couldn't get past it. I was becoming frustrated (not to mention freaked out because of the situation). Lex, who was once again sitting cross-legged in the chair across from me started to refuse to look at me. Something came over me, whether it was a burst of adrenaline or what, I don't know (there were several instances that morning where I did things to counter act &quot;him&quot; that I didn't understand how I was able to do it), but I remember telling Tas to move away from Lex (she was standing next to her) and then I told Lex to look at me. She refused, shaking her head no, on the verge of tears, but I demanded she look at me and slowly she obliged.
<br><br>
&quot;I am not talking to you right now,&quot; I told her. &quot;I am in no way talking to you, Lex. I am talking to &quot;him.&quot; Because I know he is around and this needs to stop, so you look at me!&quot; Lex's eyes changed and her whole demeanor was different within an instant. &quot;What do you want from Lex, huh?&quot; I started to demand again. &quot;You seem to want nothing to do with Tas, only me and Lex. You tell me why! What is so good about Lex that you are doing this to her?&quot; Lex's mouth curled into a very odd smile, a smirk of sorts is one way to describe it, but it was nothing like her normal smile and the closer I looked, I could see her starting to chuckle as she glared. &quot;That's right, go right ahead and smirk and laugh at me. You think that's going to affect me? It's not. That's my little sister you are messing with and it's going to stop right now. So you tell me what the Hell is so good about Lex that you insist on-&quot;
<br><br>
Lex was up and out of her seat so quickly and lunging across the table at me that I didn't have a proper chance to react. I barely heard her say, in a voice that was not her own (again, it was a male voice), &quot;I'll get what I want!&quot; as Tas screamed and grabbed onto me, which I reacted by screaming and pushing Lex off of me and to the floor of the deck. Lex was immediately in tears and asking what had just happened, with no recollection of her prior actions.
<br><br>
Since then, the board has been removed from our place, along with several other homemade boards I'd had at the time. To this day Lex and I are still tormented by &quot;him,&quot; despite the fact that we have attempted to cleanse the place by saging multiple times and speaking the Lord's Prayer. The torment comes in waves. I haven't done a Ouija session since and I can't say for certain whether I ever will again or not. I don't believe all sessions end up bad or that everything that comes through the board is bad. More so I believe to put it one way is that it is the luck of the draw. You don't know what you're going to get, and unless you know how to handle a situation you may get into, then things could turn bad.
