On March 15, 2008 I received an e-mail from Olivia A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My friends and I checked out your site after having a weird experience with an ouija board, and I thought I'd tell you our story.
<br><br>
On March 13, 2008, Danielle, Jaycie, Michelle, Brittany, and I (Olivia) decided to play an ouija board. None of us except Danielle had ever played it before, so we didn't really know what we were doing. So, our conversation started.
<br><br>
Danielle: Is there anyone that wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: (quickly responded) Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: So, what's your name?<br>
Board: F-R-E-D.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Fred, haven't I talked to you before?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: What's your last name?<br>
Board: moves up in between yes and no where it says Ouija.<br>
<br>
Danielle: So you're name's Fred Ouija?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Ok....so, who will be Olivia's next boyfriend?<br>
Board: Fred.<br>
<br>
I screamed.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Ok....are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Were you good when you were alive?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Oh....do you regret what you've done?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Jaycie: Oh, that's good.<br>
<br>
Danielle: When did you die?<br>
Board: 1897<br>
<br>
Michelle: This is stupid.<br>
<br>
The board seemed to dislike Michelle's skepticism and would not repsond to several questions until Danielle asked a certain one.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Is Michelle bothering you?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Would you like her to just sit back and watch then?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: How about if Michelle's sorry, do you accept her apology?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Can Michelle continue to play then?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Ok....well, do you consider us your friends?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Good, does that mean you wouldn't do anything to hurt us?<br>
Board: no response<br>
<br>
Olivia: Why aren't you answering us?!<br>
Board: Zawamba.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Who's that?<br>
Board: Woman.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Your wife?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: Does Zawamba like us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Danielle: So you're both good spirits?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Are you lying?<br>
Board: begins to move to no.<br>
<br>
We all took our hands off the board, screamed, and ran down the stairs.<br>
<br>
Later we played again.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Are you mad at us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Should we leave?<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
The next day, Michelle and I went to Michelle's house and played with the Ouija board with her cousins Abbie and Sarah.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Is there anyone that wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: May we ask your name?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: What is your name?<br>
Board: AMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMA.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Are those initials?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: For?<br>
Board: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Are you laughing at us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Olivia: Why?<br>
Board: slowly spells D-J-E<br>
<br>
Sarah: OH MY GOD! IT MEAN TO SAY DIE!<br>
<br>
We all ran down the stairs screaming our guts out. Later, we played it and it coninued to be Fred. I think Fred has inhabited our board.
