On February 26, 2008 I received an e-mail from Emmeli about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Emmeli (or Emily with English spelling), and I live in the north of Sweden.
<br><br>
I would like to share one of my experiences with you. I apologize ahead for any spelling and/or grammar mistakes. The names in this story have been changed. The only real name is my own.
<br><br>
It was late fall or early winter 2005, and me, my boyfriend (Raymond), one of my oldest friends (Luke) and a new friend of ours (Claire) decided to try the ouija. We didn't have one, so we made one out of a door to a kitchen cabinet and used a glass as a pointer. It had the whole Swedish alphabet and Roman numbers. We also removed all items with any religous connection from the room and turned off our cellphones and all electrical lights. We only had a bunch of white tea-lights.
<br><br>
Luke and I had done it before, and we had developed a few &quot;safety questions&quot; as we call them.  These questions are:
<br><br>
First of all: Is anyone with us?<br>
If the answer is yes we continue.<br>
*Is everyone allowed to participate? (This is the most important question)<br>
*Can we eat during this session?<br>
*Can we drink?<br>
*Can we take breaks for bathroom/smoke etc?<br>
*Is the cat/dog or any other pet allowed to be in this same room? (if there are any pets)<br>
*Are we allowed to ask questions about you?<br>
<br>
Now, the first spirit we had seemed very childish and playful. She pretended to drive a car across the board, and she made us all laugh out loud. After a while Claire started to think. She had been pregnant a few years eariler but she had lost the child just a few weeks into the pregnancy. This spirit seemed attracted to Claire, and after a while she asked if the spirit was the child that she had lost. At that moment I felt as if the temperature in the room dropped and I got a lump in my stomach.
<br><br>
The glass moved to &quot;Yes&quot; and Claire started crying. Luke asked if we could finish the session and the spirit again replied yes. Claire went into the bedroom to her boyfriend, and us others sat by the stove to have cig. After awhile Claire came out and said that she was ready to try again if we asked to have another spirit.
<br><br>
The reason that we decided to play the ouija board in the first place was beacuse Raymond wanted to talk to his uncle Steven who died in a car crash at a young age. So once again we went into the living room to try to contact Steven. Raymond said out loud that &quot;We wish to talk to my uncle Steven. Are you with us?&quot;
<br><br>
The glass moved to &quot;yes.&quot;
<br><br>
To confirm that it really was him, we asked what kind of car he drove on the night of his accident.
<br><br>
He answered it correctly.
<br><br>
We asked a few questions about life.
<br><br>
(The date, the time, and the exact words are not really accurate. This was after all in 2005 and I have a really bad memory!)
<br><br>
About this time we started to hear knockings that seemed to come from the outside of the house. We looked, but there was no one there. There was snow, but no footprints. We thought it was strange, but we didn't worry about it. We continued talking with Steven, but after a while the knockings became disturbing.
 <br><br>
We asked if Steven was the one doing the knockings, but he replied &quot;No.&quot; With that we ended the session, and decided to try and talk with my older brother Bruce who was stillborn a few years before I was born.
<br><br>
He responded to our call, and after all the saftey questions, we started to ask him about the knocking.  After a few twists and turns (I don't remember exactly how), we found out that the one doing the knocking was not a friendly spirit, and he warned us and adviced us to quit. We also found out that my grandmother (who died eariler that year) did not approve of me playing with the ouija board.
<br><br>
We asked if all of us had enough protection, but Bruce replied &quot;no.&quot; We asked which one of us didn't have enough protection, and Bruce moved the glass towards Raymond, my boyfriend. We asked if he would be protected enough if he removed the bandage he had on his arm to hide a tattoo of a cross he has. Bruce hesitated, but then answered yes and we ended the session.
We haven't played since, but we're planning to try again.  But this time, we're going to say a protection prayer and I'm going to clean the apartment afterwards. I'm also going to have a necklace with a celtic cross hidden on me. Don't ask me how I know this, but carrying that cross and saying the prayers are going to protect us.
<br><br>
In this story I say &quot;play with a ouija board&quot; but that is just so that you will understand what I'm talking about. I DO NOT consider an ouija board as a toy, and using it IS NOT a game! You can get really hurt, and I would recommened everyone to clean the room that they're in afterwards and carry a cross on your person after, just to be sure. If anyone agrees/disagrees or just wanta to chat, you're welcome to e-mail me at silver_varg@hotmail.com
