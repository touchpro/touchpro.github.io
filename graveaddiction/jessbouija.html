On August 2, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jessica B. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Jessica and I had an odd happening using the Ouija Board a week ago.  Me and my neighbor, not so much friend (quot;Tom&quot;), decided to use the Ouija board.  We said a protection prayer that I read on this site.  We lit three candles and started playing.
<br><br>
Me:  Is there a spirit in this house?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Me:  What is your name?<br>
Board:  Zack<br>
<br>
Me:  What year were you born?<br>
Board:  1860<br>
<br>
Me:  How old are you, and are you related to me?<br>
Board:  19 and am to your nan (I call my dad's mother Nanny)<br>
<br>
Me:  If you are related to me, what is my Nanny's Maiden Name?<br>
Board:  (SPELLED MY NANNYS MAIDEN NAME) I was amazed<br>
<br>
After I asked that question, I felt something grab my arm tight.  It hurt so bad, and one all the candles blew out at that moment.  I FREAKED OUT but decided to continue and let Tom take over, but I had to ask if it was Zack hurting me...
<br><br>
Me:  Is that you, Zack, grabbing my arm?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Me:  Can you let go?<br>
Board: Yes, you welcome<br>
<br>
After that the pain went away<br>
So Tom began to speak...<br>
<br>
Tom:  Is there anybody who wants to talk to me?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Tom: What would you like to say to me?<br>
Board: You are bad, evil, bad<br>
<br>
When the board said that, the door slammed violently. We jumped. So Tom had to walk outside, he was too freaked.  Even though I was scared to death, I wanted to know why he was so bad.
<br><br>
Me:  Why is Tom bad?<br>
Board:  He will hurt you<br>
<br>
Me:  When<br>
Board: 4 days<br>
<br>
Me:  How<br>
Board: Be careful love<br>
<br>
Me:  How will he hurt me?<br>
Board:  Goodbye<br>
<br>
Well, I was concerned but eventually forgot about it a day later or so.  3 or 4 days later...I went to Tom's garage because he wanted to show me something he made.  So I went back there and he asked me to go to a dark corner in the garage.  I was going to go, but I saw something move in the corner of my eye - like a ghost - and when I looked over I saw Tom slip a long knife into his jacket.  When I saw that I ran to my car and left.  Anyway, I wanted to tell this story because I believe this spirit Zack saved my life...if I had not done what the ouija board said, I would have probably been raped or killed by Tom.  Since then I haven't spoken to Tom, but every now and then he asks me why I ran and wants me to go back into that garage.  Thank you Zack!
