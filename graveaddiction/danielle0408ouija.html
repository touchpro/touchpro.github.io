On April 14, 2008 I received an e-mail from Danielle about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This was the fourth time in my first ever Ouija night to play the game (hopefully that made sense).  This session was probably the one that convinced me the most since I was skeptic in the beginning.  Okay, so after several of our friends left, we waited a little and then went to my friend Courtney's room to play. We turned off the lights. Me, Gloria, Valerie, and Courtney all had our fingers on the guider.  NONE OF THIS IS EXAGGERATED. We are all high school juniors and intelligent students.  We are not easily manipulated and do not accept explainations without concise evidence.  However, this night made me open my mind a little more to Ouija.  Here's how it went...
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits present?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Us: Can you tell us your name?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: FIDEL<br>
<br>
Us: What is your last name?<br>
Board: CASTRO (NO JOKE!)<br>
<br>
We're freaking out because no one truely knows if Fidel Castro is really still alive since he hasn't been seen by his own people in over a year (he is the Dictator of Cuba).<br>
<br>
Us: Is your name Fidel Castro?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
HAHA...This guy's funny right?<br>
<br>
Courtney: Do you think that you're funny?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Us: What is your real name?<br>
<br>
This is where I start crying in fear.<br>
<br>
Board: DANIELE (my spelling=Danielle)<br>
<br>
I was like...okay, it could mean like Daniel or something.  It could be a coincidence...<br>
<br>
Me: What is your last name?<br>
Board: EEST....(stops) (my spelling=East****)<br>
<br>
I'm shaking and screaming.<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name Danielle East****?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know that that is my name?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Me: [no joke] Do you know that you just scared the crap out of me?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.<br>
<br>
Us: Do you still want to talk to us?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
So we continue...with lights on.<br>
<br>
Us: Did you have a wife?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Us: What was her name?<br>
Board: VAL (...stops)<br>
<br>
Us: Are you trying to spell Valerie?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Next Gloria asks a question that only she knew, just in case someone was joking around and was moving it...<br>
<br>
Gloria: What is my mother's name?<br>
Board: GLORIA<br>
<br>
The board was right...Gloria is named after her mother...<br>
<br>
Us: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 73<br>
<br>
ALRIGHT...<br>
<br>
Valerie was being annoying by guessing everything and cracking jokes, possibly confusing the board...<br>
<br>
Us: Is Valerie annoying you?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
We're laughing, then I want to know...<br>
<br>
Me: What will I be when I grow up?<br>
Board: EMERGEN...(completely stops)<br>
<br>
We all start wondering what to do next.  We're thinking the board was going to spell emergency room or something.  Somehow we get off topic because I'm crying my eyes out in disbelief.<br>
<br>
Then Gloria has a question.  Earlier that night we had contacted a spirit named Kate, and Gloria asked who she (herself) would marry.  The board began to spell out the first three letters of his last name (CAR...), then it completely stopped.  It just so happens that Gloria was going out with a guy who we always call by his last name: CAR****.<br>
<br>
Gloria: Who will I marry?<br>
Board: CARD...<br>
<br>
Us: Are you trying to spell CAR****?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Now, we never even mentioned Parker's first name, just in case it can hear or something of the sort.  So...<br>
<br>
Us: What is CAR****'s  first name?<br>
Board: BRAND...<br>
<br>
Us: Is it Brandon?!<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Haha...we're laughing and Gloria's freaking out.  Gloria refused to put her hand back on to continue the session, but the board would not continue without her.  She put her hand back on, and it continued.<br>
<br>
Us: How many kids will Gloria have?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Me: Who will I marry?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
I'm like &quot;okay...&quot;  (didn't really make sense).  I'm crying...<br>
<br>
Me: Will I be married?<br>
Board: NO (I didn't even WANT to know why)<br>
<br>
Me: How many kids will I have?<br>
Board: 0<br>
<br>
Court: How many kids will I have?<br>
Board: 0<br>
<br>
Valerie wants to know what my career was supposed to be since it never finished...<br>
<br>
Me: What will my career be?<br>
Board: DOCTOR<br>
<br>
I'm thinking &quot;yeah right...this is starting to seem bogus&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know what I want to be?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Me: What do I want to be when I grow up? (Mind you, I have never, EVER told anyone what I truely wanted to be because I find it embarassing. But of course, I had to know)<br>
Board: WRITER<br>
<br>
This is completely correct...I was scared beyond belief and could not say anything.  None of my friends even knew that...not even my family.  Then, of course, my friends ask if it's right, and I shake my head yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know that I hate blood?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know that I have no desire whatsoever to be a doctor?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Gloria's aunt called, and we had to hurry.<br>
<br>
Us: Thank you for your time, but we need to go. Goodbye. Rest in Peace.<br>
Board: GOOD BYE<br>
<br>
None of the above was a joke, and I am still scared about using the board.  However, my curiosity has taken control.  I am still openminded to whether the ouija is real or not.  I was the one at the beginning of the night who wanted to take the board to the cemetery (which is extremely large), and I am so glad that my friends who I played with (who had played before) refused to do anything of the sort in a cemetery.  Ha ha...peer pressure can be good sometimes!
