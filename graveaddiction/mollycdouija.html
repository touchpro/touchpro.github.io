On April 18, 2007 I received an e-mail from Molly C.D. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
It was my friend Ashley's birthday party, and there were six people huddled together, each with two fingers on the oracle. We turned off all the lights in her room except for her lava lamp and computer. We started asking questions like, &quot;Is there a spirit here?&quot; and &quot;How are you doing?&quot; (of course that was a joke!).  Then the computer turned off, the hall light outside her room went off, and the oracle started moving a bit. Lydia and I immediately flung our hands off of the oracle and ran out.
<br><br>
As I was leaving, I noticed that the air off her bed was a lot heavier than the air on her bed. We decided to go back in, but Ashley wouldn't let us. So we waited for them to get done with the games. And when they were done they all came out and told their experience. They said not much happened after we left, so they started a seance. A ghost girl appeared, and was clutching Ashley's arm - you could tell she wasn't lying because her arm was very red. Soon, all was almost forgotten and we moved on with the rest of the night. When I went to bed it was just Deanna and I in the other room. When I layed down, Deanna said, &quot;You're sitting on something,&quot; and when I looked, I was sitting on the oracle from the Ouija board!
<br><br>
We ran into Ashley's bedroom to look at the Ouija board, to find that it was propped up on a pillow! And absolutely no one had been in the room after the seance. A trick? Or actual spirits? No one knows to this day.
