On November 30, 2008 I received an e-mail from Simone G. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was using a board at my friend's house, and we had a very interesting experience. My name is Simone, and I was playing with Kenton and Brittany.  After asking the usual questions, the board told us that what we were talking to was not a spirit. We asked repeatedly what it was, if it was actually a lying spirit and whatnot. But it insisted that it was &quot;MAGIC.&quot;
<br><br>
We were told that both Kenton and Brittany had magic in them, but I did not. This &quot;magic&quot; was from a really long time ago, I think it said around 1300 (either A.D. or B.C., I'm not sure).  Because of our ancestry, Brittany was told she was a princess and Kenton a knight. I was called an adafter, which apparently was aware of magic, and fought for the good side of magic in an ancient war, but didn't actually have any magic.
<br><br>
We were told that someone called Artimis killed the magic's brothers and sisters, and that Artimis was evil. We were told that Artimis was eventually put into a magical prison, but a traitor had let Artimis escape. Also, apparently there would be another good magic versus evil magic war in 2052.
<br><br>
I don't really believe any of it, but it held our interest for at least an hour. The last times we'd played it at my house and Brit's house, the light plug got pulled out of it's socket and the lights were flickering. But nothing weird happened at Kenton's house.
