On July 4, 2006 I received an e-mail from Nicole Weston about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have my very own Ouija board, and weird stuff has been going on when me and my freinds play. One day we asked if any
spirit likes my friend named Veronika, and one said he did.  His name was Winston.  He said he loved Veronika with all his heart, and than a few days later we played and we started talking to Winston again and he said he wanted to kill Veronika on Halloween night.
<br><br>
Then we said that we wanted to talk to the guide spirit of my ouija board, but Winston didn't let us...he had possessed the board and he didn't let us talk to the spirit guide of my friend's ouija board either.  In fact, he didn't let us talk to any other spirits that we had been talking to lately. He said that he locked them all in hell. Also, he kept on trying to escape from the board.  He kept on going through the alphabet, but we never let him do the whole thing. A week later he said he would kill all the
people in my class that didn't have a ouija board.  That meant that me and my friend taylor wouldn't die because we both had ouija boards.
<br><br>One day at school, I brought the ouija board with me so we could try to prevent him from killing anyone.  I put the planchette in my desk, and the board tall way up on the seat.  We had to go down for an assembly...when we came back up to the room, the board was on my desk and the planchette was on my seat. We were really scared then, so we asked him if he was out of the board - if he was free.  He answered, and the answer was yes, he was free.   He said that once he gets free, he will kill all the people that didn't have an ouija board in my class. Now we are really scared, and we want to know if anyone has any advice.
