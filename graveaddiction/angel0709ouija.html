On July 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Angel A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Angel, and I have always studied the paranormal but never really had a experience with it. Well, one night my brother were and I were watching YouTube videos on people using ouija boards, and I thought, whoa does this really work? I got online and looked up how to make a ouija board, so my brother and I made one. The next day my boyfriend came over and we decided to try it. We went into the back room in my basement (really dark) and lit three candles...
<br><br>
1st attempt:<br>
<br>
(I spun the planchette 3 times)<br>
<br>
Me: Hello, is anyone here?<br>
Board: No movement.<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: Greg<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 45<br>
<br>
Me: Are you an evil spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What do you want?<br>
Board: BLOOD<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(It was my first time, so I freaked out and I stopped)<br>
<br>
The next day my friends, Poter and Taylor, came over my house to try to the ouija board. Poter does not believe in the afterlife. Poter says that he has a 200 year old curse on his family; he has found out by dreams and much more.
<br><br>
2nd attempt:<br>
<br>
(Spun planchette 3 times)<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone here?<br>
(no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone here?<br>
(no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you an evil spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell me your name?<br>
Board: xyx<br>
<br>
Me: What can we call you?<br>
Board: Z<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you follow me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you mad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: At who?<br>
Board: You<br>
<br>
Me: Why are you mad at me?<br>
Board: Non<br>
<br>
Me:What?<br>
(No movement)<br>
<br>
Poter said he wanted to do it all by himself, because he thought someone was moving it.<br>
<br>
Poter: Is anyone here?<br>
(no movement)<br>
<br>
Poter: Is anyone here?<br>
Board: (No movement)<br>
<br>
We tried so many times, but the board would not work for just Poter.<br>
<br>
He asked Taylor to put her hand on it.<br>
<br>
Out of nowhere, the board moves to yes...as soon as Taylor put her hand on it.<br>
<br>
Poter: Do you think I'm scared of you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Poter: Do you want to hurt me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Poter: Why?<br>
Board: Power<br>
<br>
Poter: Can you hurt me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Poter: Why?<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Poter took the board home with him. And burned it.
