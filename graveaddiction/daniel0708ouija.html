On July 25, 2008 I received an e-mail from Daniel about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A few nights ago, some friends and I bought a Ouija board.  Hayley, Lauren, and Britney.  This story is kinda long, but believe me: it's all true and we all believe in spirits now.  This story takes place over three different nights.
<br><br>
<b>Night 1:</b>
<br><br>
Daniel: Is there anyone who wants to speak?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel, Hayley, and Lauren: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Daniel: Are there any good spirts that want to talk?<br>
Board: STOP<br>
<br>
<i>so we all said goodbye and put the board away</i>
<br><br>
<b>Night 2:</b>
<br><br>
Daniel: Are there any good spirts that wish to speak?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Ok, let's start by getting your name.<br>
Board:  S.A.L.<br>
<br>
Daniel: Are those initials?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: What do they stand for?<br>
Board: Steven A. Low<br>
<br>
Daniel: How old are you?<br>
Board: 47<br>
<br>
Daniel: Are we bothering you in any way?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Do you want us to leave you alone?<br>
Board: STAY<br>
<br>
Daniel: Have you ever encountered an evil spirit?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: What about good spirits?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Do you wish to tell anyone anything?<br>
Board: HS<br>
<br>
Daniel: You want to tell Hayley something?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you like Hayley?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: As more than a friend?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Is there anyone here that you don't like?<br>
Board? No<br>
<br>
<i>so we proceed in asking basic questions, ranging from how he died to what all he could do as a ghost</i><br>
<br>
<b>Night 3:</b>
<br><br>
Daniel: May we speak to the good spirit of Steven Low?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Is this him?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Are we bothering you now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Do you know if there is a ghost in our house?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Is it a good ghost?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Hayley: Is it my grandma?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Britney: Are you in our circle right now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Are you sitting on my truck?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Do you want to sit on my truck?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
<i>so we talk to him about more random things, when all of a sudden...</i><br>
<br>
Hayley: Ouch...something just hit my arm (she looked scared and as if she were about to cry)<br>
<br>
Daniel: What do you mean something hit your arm?<br>
<br>
Hayley: I don't know...I felt something hit my arm. I'm not playing anymore...I'll just watch.<br>
<br>
Daniel: Did you hit Hayley?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Did you mean to hurt her?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Then why did you do it?<br>
Board: LOVE<br>
<br>
Daniel: Do you like Hayley as more than a friend?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
<i>then he started talking all weird and stuff</i><br>
<br>
Britney: Is there an evil spirit present?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Can you make it leave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: Is it gone?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Daniel: How did you make it leave?<br>
Board: LEAVE<br>
<br>
Daniel: So can people make ghosts leave like that too?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel: Did the evil spirt try to harm Hayley?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
<i>then out of nowhere, the planchette starts moving without us asking anything</i><br>
<br>
Board: DZW<br>
<br>
Britney: Derrick? (her brother who wasnt even present)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Britney: Is he in trouble?<br>
Board: H...<br>
<br>
Britney: Is he high?<br>
Board: <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
Daniel: Are you still there?<br>
Board: <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
<i>after about five minutes or more</i><br>
<br>
Daniel: Is the good spirit of Steven Low still with us?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
ALL: GOODBYE<br>
<br>
We flipped the board over in the box and put it away.  Later on, when Lauren and Britney left, I could tell that something was bothering Hayley.<br><br>
Daniel: You know what I think?  What if the bad spirit was trying to possess you and Steven did something to make it stop, and you felt it?<br>
<br>
Hayley: I don't know...Daniel, I'm not trying to say anything about Steven, and I didn't tell anyone this, but after I felt that, I said a prayer to God asking him to please make all evil spirits leave...and right after that Steven stopped talking...<br>
<br>
Hayley never has been a spiritual person.  In fact, she knew about the Bible and everything that has to do with Jesus and God, but doubted a lot of it, like me...after tonight we believe in it all.  We decided to never play with the ouija board again.  I believe some of the stories I read on this site, and I think we are all really lucky that something worse didn't happen.  OUIJA BOARDS ARE REAL, AND IT IS NOT A GAME!!!
