On August 28, 2007 I received an e-mail from Yann about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Here's my story - when I was a teen one of my mates introduced me to a friend of his, who was a few years older. He was really into ouija, except he didn't use a board but letters from a Scrabble game and a glass, plus a YES and NO that he would write on pieces of paper. The 1st time we did it, the spirit said I had a good aura and that I would help the communication just by being here. Anyway, we kept doing it and afterwards we told our friends, who wanted to see that so we did it again and again. Sometimes - most times - it was saying gibberish, but sometimes the spirit said he knew
someone around the table. We'd then ask that person not to touch the glass and to ask stuff that only he knew the answer. It wasn't 100 accurate in its answers, but enough to be troubling.
<br><br>
A good spirit called Philip Mayer kept coming back - he was a teenager who committed suicide. One of his ex-classmates was around the table, not touching the glass. We got the name, his age when he died, hair and eye color from the board, plus the fact that a shot himself with his dad's gun while his dad was tring to open his locked bedroom door. Then he said he was in hell (which made me chuckle as I don't believe in that - so I thought someone was taking the piss), that there were many with him, and that he wasn't allowed to talk to us, that he was being beaten for doing it but was doing it because he was bored (I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense).
<br><br>
We called him another time and he was here almost instantly, very chatty...I asked &quot;is there a door between your world and ours?&quot;, and he said &quot;yes, Ouija.&quot; I asked &quot;can we do anything to help?&quot; and he replied &quot;yes, take my place.&quot; I was like &quot;what, are you joking?&quot; and he said no. Then the glass
started to go around very fast on the table (with our fingers on it), so we stopped.
<br><br>
I forgot to say that all this was happening in a seaside resort where my parents owned a flat, and after going there every summer for years, I had a group of about 20 friends. Only a few of them had seen stuff happening, but of course they told everybody, and they all were interested in trying.
<br><br>
So...when my parents went to have dinner in a restaurant a few days later, I invited a few of my friends to have a seance in tiny our flat. Too many of them showed up, and I didn't want all of them to come in, plus it started to rain quite hard and the guys were pounding on the door to let them in but we had started to call Philip Mayer again inside, ignoring them. It was not working, I was getting annoyed, everybody was shouting or laughing...all of a sudden the glass starts to move and I thougt it was Philip Mayer, but nope. It said its name was Regan, an evil spirit. I remember that the little girl in the Exorcist was called like that. It said it knew me (I know no Regan) and starting to insult me and hurl abuse, saying I should take its place in hell, that I will die soon, etc. Quite a change of tone and it was
the last thing I expected. It wouldn't leave and kept saying unpleasant things, so after a few attempts to say goodbye, I asked everybody to take their fingers off the glass. Everybody did, except my little sister, who was 6 or 7 at the time, and the glass kept going aroung very fast, with just her tiny finger on it - and the look of fright on her face. I screamed at her to take off her finger, which she did. The glass stopped in front of me, then slowly it tipped over and exploded in lots of little pieces. We all freaked out and all my mates left, leaving me and my little sister terrified, as I was convinced I had released an evil spirit in the flat. I didn't dare say anything to my parents when they came back from the restaurant, but that night I was so scared that I didn't sleep and I actually vomited in the loo
because I was so scared - the first and only time in my life that I did.
<br><br>
Eventually nothing happened, no knocking or furniture moving, etc but I was paranoid that something was going to happen to me for a long time. Then I read that spirits would often try to scare you but that they could not bring you physical harm. Anyway, I did it less often after that but each time I did, Regan showed up and started insulting me. I laughed and said she wasn't scaring me anymore, that I knew she couldn't do anything to me, and she would leave.
