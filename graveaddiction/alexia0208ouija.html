On February 15, 2008 I received an e-mail from Alexia about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
On April 13, 2007 (a date very dear to my own heart), a bunch of us at were at my friend Vivianna's house. There was me (Alexia), Anna, Amelia, Vivianna, Katarina, and Elisabeth. Around 3 in the morning, because none of us could sleep, we decided to play with her Ouija board. So, we grabbed it along with a book she had on Celtic rituals and went out to the tent that we all were sharing. I had been told previously by someone that spirits seemed to be drawn to me for some reason because I do not pity them, I understand them more than anything. Well, in any case, we got it out and we had two people (my friends Amelia and Vivianna) who were both very into the occult as opposed to the rest of us who really had no experience with it. I was originally not going to be involved, but they wanted me to be there because I had my rosary and I was the only person in that tent who really believed in God. When we were first starting out, we were asking questions and with the way the planchette was moving, we ascertained that someone was moving it. Then we stopped for a little bit and started back up about 10 minutes later. This time, we were convinced that we had something. Here is what exactly happened. This lasted for almost 2 and a half hours.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone who would like to speak to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Just to make sure this isn't one of them doing this, what time of day did my sister die? (I had never told any of my  friends when she died)<br>
Board: Morning<br>
<br>
Amelia: How many children do I want?<br>
Board: Two<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: What is my middle name? (All of us had always racked our brains trying to figure it out, because unlike our schedules at school, her middle name never showed up on hers.)<br>
Board: Daciana<br>
<br>
Me: What country is my great-great-grandmother from?<br>
Board: Darmstadt, Germany<br>
<br>
Me: Wow, it even got the city right<br>
Amy: Lexie, how do you know that one of us didn't do that?<br>
Me: Because it took all of you 16 years to figure out Germany was even a country.<br>
Board: hahaha<br>
<br>
Anna: See Lex? The spirit thinks you're funny. Isn't it kinda sad when only dead people find you funny?<br>
Board: Shes a nice girl<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you (by this time, as a precautionary measure, I had wrapped my rosary around the hand that was on the planchette)<br>
Board: AEW<br>
<br>
Amelia: AEW? What's that?<br>
Board: granma<br>
<br>
Me: Grandma?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vivianna: Who's grandma<br>
Board: Lex<br>
<br>
Me: The one that came from Germany might have had those initials (I had papers that I had found that had my ancestry on them and I checked her name and it was Augusta Evangeline Weiss)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Katarina: Do you have a message for any of us?<br>
Board: Alicky<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: There is no one here by that name.<br>
Me: Yes there is<br>
Elisabeth: Who?<br>
Me: It's my nickname. Nicholas gave it to me as a pet name because he loved calling me Alexandra.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Amelia: What message do you have for her?<br>
Board: Do not turn back on god.<br>
<br>
Me: Why would I do that?<br>
Board: Blame him for death<br>
<br>
Me: Blame him for what death?<br>
Board: Nikolasha (my secret pet name for my boyfriend)<br>
<br>
Me: It isn't him who will cause it?<br>
Board: No, bad person<br>
<br>
(After this, the planchette did not seem to move for about another 10 minutes when we decided to try again. I was almost completely out of this session because of what had happened)
<br><br>
Amelia: Is there anyone who would like to speak to any of us?<br>
Board: One<br>
<br>
Amelia: Who is this?<br>
Board: Mikhail<br>
<br>
Amelia: Hello Mikhail, who would you like to speak to?<br>
Board: Eliza<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: Do you mean me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: Why me?<br>
Board: She listens to you.<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: Who does<br>
Board: The German<br>
<br>
Amelia: Ok, who has German blood, besides Lexie, we already know about her.<br>
Elisabeth: I'm Austro-Romanian.<br>
Anna: I'm Italian<br>
Katarina: Sorry, Russian.<br>
Vivianna: Irish<br>
Amelia: And I know my family is from England, so guess what Lexie, you are officially the German.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: Why does it matter that I have control over her?<br>
Board: God<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: What about God?<br>
Board: God helps her<br>
<br>
Amelia: Why would you care about God being on her side? At least God is helping one of us. (I later smacked her for saying that)<br>
Board: Hate God<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you hate God?<br>
Board: Because you came back<br>
<br>
Me: I came back from what?<br>
Amelia: I never knew you left<br>
Me: Neither did I<br>
Board: Hurt<br>
<br>
Amelia: Hurt what?<br>
Board: Hurt me<br>
<br>
Me: I would have to know you to hurt you.<br>
Board: Past<br>
<br>
Vivianna: A past life?<br>
Board: Yes. Wife.<br>
<br>
Me: Wow, I didn't even know I had a past life.<br>
Anna: Lexie, sometimes I wonder if you realize that you have a brain.<br>
Me: Wait, I have a brain?<br>
Board: You are still smart<br>
<br>
Me: Aww, the spirit called me smart.<br>
Anna: At least someone was stupid enough to.<br>
Board: Shut up<br>
<br>
Anna: Why did you tell me to shut up?<br>
Board: You are a bitch<br>
<br>
Anna: I'm a bitch?<br>
Board: You were mean to Viktoria.<br>
<br>
Amelia: Lex, is that your middle name?<br>
Me: Nope, my middle name is Marie. But that name does ring a bell. I often hear it in my dreams.<br>
Anna: I cant believe that you actually get sleep.<br>
Board: She should.<br>
<br>
Me: Now the spirit sounds like my mother.<br>
Board: Whore<br>
<br>
Amelia: Lexie isn't a whore. She is the anti-whore.<br>
Board: Cheated<br>
<br>
Anna: Bad Alexia.<br>
Board: Killed<br>
<br>
Anna: Killed who?<br>
Board: Her<br>
<br>
Me: This dude killed me when I was alive back when I was married to him?<br>
Board: Yes. Gun.<br>
<br>
Amelia: Not only did he kill you, he shot you.<br>
Board: Cried. Blood.<br>
<br>
Anna: Did you cry when you shot her and saw her bleeding?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Wait...Mikhail. That name does ring a bell. Mikhail, in my past life, did we have a daughter named Alina?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What happened to her?<br>
Board: Came with me. New mother.<br>
<br>
Anna: Oh isn't that pleasant Lexie, the bastard killed you then married someone else.<br>
Me: Wow, I feel so loved.<br>
Board: Kill.<br>
<br>
Anna: Who do you want to kill?<br>
Board: You<br>
<br>
Anna: Why me? Lexie is the one that cheated on you.<br>
Me: He already killed me for that once!<br>
Board: Treat like scum.<br>
<br>
Amelia: Are you mad how Anna constantly talks down to Lexie?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: See? Told you it would get you in trouble...Anna?<br>
Amelia: Oh my God, she's out cold.<br>
Board: Got her<br>
<br>
Me (Elisabeth and I were the only ones that were still using the board, all the rest were with Anna): Did you kill her?<br>
Board: No. Sleep<br>
<br>
Elisabeth: Did you knock her out?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: That wasn't nice.<br>
Board: Mean to you<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, I'm done. Bye.<br>
Elisabeth: Me too.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Ever since then, the only reason I have been at their sessions like this is to carry the Bible and be the consultant with God.
