On November 28, 2008 I received an e-mail from Patrick Duffy about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend and I first used his Ouija board last summer.  It was my idea when I saw the board in his game closet, and he was only mildly interested in playing it. Despite his reservations as to whether it would work, we contacted a spirit straight away and have spoken to her on a few occasions.
<br><br>
Her name is Lynn, and she is stuck in limbo where it is dark.  She is generally cold and lonesome.  There are other spirits there, many of which are &quot;ill&quot; or sick in the head.  Her death was caused by falling from a car racing along Seagoville Highway in 1939, and the tragic nature of this death, according to her, caused her soul to be trapped in this void.
<br><br>
After our first session with Lynn and introductions were made, I was intrigued that this could all be very real.  The possibility that neither my friend nor myself was moving the planchette (consciously or not) was becoming very unlikely. After finding out some of the details about Lynn, I found records of her car fatality by researching through the internet.  Interestingly enough, she was quite aware of my researching efforts AS THEY OCCURRED.  I texted my friend when I found her obituary, and she simultaneously knocked over a baseball bat at his house (startled him to say the least, but she later confirmed that she only wanted to acknowledge what we had found.)
<br><br>
On one occasion, we asked Lynn where she was in the house.  She said, &quot;the sewing room.&quot;  We were in the living room, which was a kitchen and dining room away from her location.  We asked if we could come use the board in the sewing room and she said, &quot;no, others.&quot;  We asked why she was in the sewing room, and she said &quot;light.&quot;  So apparently the spirit is not always in the room you are in, maybe just nearby.  Lynn also likes for a white candle to be burned, and she was drawn to the dimly lit sewing room as opposed to the living room -- only lit by a few candles.
<br><br>
Lynn can hear our voices, but not music from a radio or television.  She said hearing human voices is like a radio without a dial.  She has a sense of humor, enthusiastically agreeing that I sing off-key.  Her favorite song is Dream by the Pied Pipers -- which happens to be a very difficult song to sing.  Despite the one time she knocked over a baseball bat to confirm her obituary, she is very hands-off to this world.  When I have asked her about any physical manifestations, she insists &quot;not allowed,&quot; and the more repremanding answer, &quot;not a game.&quot;  She did, however, say that she could help me find things.  I still haven't figured out if this is psychological on my part, but it seems to work.  I simply announce what I can't find and then voila!  Thanks, Lynn.
<br><br>
The questions Lynn has posed to us, often met with our dumbfound silence while we stared at our hands...
<br><br>
Lynn: &quot;Are you married?&quot;  -- Try explaining two 21st century homos to a 19 year old country girl from the 30's.
<br><br>
Lynn: &quot;Why do you talk to me?&quot;  -- Um, is it okay with you?  We're curious?  This was an awkward one to have her ask us, but it did reveal more about how our relationship works through the board. She answered that she likes us, we only get on her nerves &quot;sometimes but not a lot,&quot; and that she doesn't have to talk if she doesn't want to.
<br><br>
Lynn: &quot;Why so many angry souls?&quot;  -- This was the question that killed me. We'd just asked her if she had any questions about the world as it is today, thinking she might be curious about current events or something with an easy answer like that.  What do you say to this?  After a long minute, we both gave our two cents about the complications of modern living and how people have lost sight of things in life that make you genuinely happy.  To this she answered, &quot;easy not to see if you are not looking.&quot;
<br><br>
I said, &quot;How does a 19 year old get to be so wise?&quot;  and she said, &quot;practice.&quot;
<br><br>
Unfortunately, we probably won't talk with Lynn again for awhile.  On our last visits, she has directed us away from the board and encouraged us to &quot;have joy.&quot;  Oh yeah, and &quot;focus on life, not death.&quot;
<br><br>
I feel lucky that: when we sat down to play with this Ouija board last summer, we encountered a benevolent spirit on our first try.  There have been times where Lynn was not who we contacted (we have passwords and know a lot about her personal life for cross-referencing.)  She has made it clear that using the board can be very risky, but that does not mean every myth you hear is true.  The most sobering advice I have been given by Lynn is to have joy, your time is so limited, make the best of it.  I try to remember this advice when I am having a meltdown over three red lights in a row in traffic.
<br><br>
The board is a unique way of peeking into one aspect of existance after death.  I'd say that I learned quite a bit from this experience and I am grateful to have communicated with Lynn.  I don't know how safe I feel with the board in general though.  It feels like opening a window into a very dark place, letting a little square of light shine brightly into the abyss, and then announcing, &quot;is anybody there?&quot;
