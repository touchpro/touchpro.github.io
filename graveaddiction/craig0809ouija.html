On August 4, 2009 I received an e-mail from Craig P. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

The reason occult seances can develop into an addiction is when they WORK. The fact that there's not a tangible person dictating the words to you is fascinating, and the user delves into it more and more. The movie &quot;Witchboard&quot; may have been partially fictitious, but when the medium (played by &quot;Patch&quot; on &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;) emphasized to these partygoers that more and more use of the board can lead to progressive entrapment, he was very right. The movie featured diabolical forces throwing things around - this was based on fact. Two years ago the History Channel featured a Ouija board related incident that happened decades ago, maybe during the 50's or after, where that boy was possessed by terrible fits, inanimate objects moving and tossed around, and &quot;St. Louis&quot; carved into his chest by an unseen hand (that city is where they found a Protestant pastor or exorcist who stopped the possession.)  If you read true accounts of the Salem Village witch trials, whether it was the Devil that possessed these girls or just mass fear and hysteria, something evil was definitely afoot. I personally have not seen black magic spells enacted by a witch, I'd have to be skeptical at first, but the Salem Village magistrates meticulously cross-examined the possessed and the accused, very often dismissing or postponing charges to spare an innocent person from the gallows.   I mean, how often do you read the court reports and see &quot;witchcraft&quot; among &quot;Burglary,&quot; &quot;Wire Fraud,&quot; &quot;2nd Degree Assault,&quot; &quot;Prostitution,&quot; or &quot;Felon in Possession of Firearm.&quot;   Never.  Wiccan witches have taken the fear and bad stigma away from sorcery or necromancy.
<br><br>
My maiden voyage on the Ouija board was in summer of 1984. We asked the board simple cut and dried questions and it responded. I put down my Led Zeppelin bandana by the board, with the winged fallen angel, and I asked, &quot;Just who is this angel?&quot;  The board spelled out &quot;Apollo.&quot;  Well, I was surprised, I had known about the ancient Greek gods and Apollo, god of light but I was really tickled to hear that and not Lucifer, fallen angel. Well, a year later when the Led Zep biography came out, called &quot;Hammer of the Gods,&quot; the glossy publicity photos in the middle of the book, the original &quot;Swan Song&quot; label painting was indeed entitled &quot;Apollo, Bringer of Light.&quot; Well, well...nothing to obsess about, but very informative nonetheless.
<br><br>
The board continued spelling things, and it wrote out &quot;Burn picture book...1976...I don't like Jimmy Carter.&quot; (No offense to the Carter family, spirits have opinions too.) In retrospect, it was referring to the 1976 issue of Playboy magazine with an interview with Carter that Gene's dad had stashed in the garage -- in 1985, the garage caught on fire, and the house with it (rural area, near lake) and the whole family had to relocate to Wyoming, fortunately their insurance paid for a mountain home for their family, 4 people all told.
<br><br>
Let's move ahead to late 1989. The &quot;Ouijers&quot; were again Gene W., myself, and another guy that we didn't know too well, John J., was very often full of it and how a third party could be pushing the indicator or planchette on purpose was probably made true by him. However I can swear by Gene's credibility and my own.
<br><br>
--A spirit came on the board and said his name was Netar, born in Saudi Arabia, but was in Hell then. I asked, &quot;What do you have to say to us?&quot; It responded, &quot;Soon the Earth will open and we will walk among you.&quot;  All 3 of us had chills for a second-isn't there a Bible passage that says how demons or bad angels will walk among us during the End Times? (Special thanks to Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; video, where &quot;Ghosts and Ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom.&quot;
<br><br>
We kept at it. Some spirit mentioned what happened to Jacob Wetterling, who abducted him and where he could be found. (Famous child-abduction case in MN, 1989.) He still hasn't been found - maybe 2 years ago I personally called the Wetterlings with this spectral lead, maybe too late, but state and national law enforcement would be able to discern if it was worth looking into as a solid lead. I wouldn't set a task force on a nationwide manhunt if it was just that third dork with us that was misleading us by pushing the planchette.
<br><br>
I made it clear to Jerry Wetterling that I would not accept one penny of reward money...Beth, if you're in the know about this type of thing, people who gain riches thru occult means don't come to a good end. Like William Fuld, who patented the board? Durind table-tapping seances, he was told &quot;Make these boards, they'll sell well and you'll make millions.&quot;  Indeed they did. When Fuld was inspecting the new 3rd floor of his factory, the wind took him and he fell to a premature death. I've heard tales of stock brokers who consult the board for futures, but it doesn't sound good to me.
