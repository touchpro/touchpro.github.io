On February 11, 2006 I received an e-mail from Miguel Pena about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I had recently bought the new glow in the dark ouija board at the time, and one night me and my girlfriend felt like using the ouija board since there was nothing else to do at the time. The weather was terrible so we thought we would just stay indoors and mess with the ouija board for awhile. We sat in my living room and started to ask the ouija board questions.  It took awhile to work, then my girlfriend asked if there was anyone there, and the board said yes. Now, we encountered a few spirits that kept wanting us to turn on the television and put it on channel 228. We did that, but it was nothing.  Then out of nowhere the planchette starts spelling out &quot;Capano's wife&quot;. So I asked it, &quot;Are you Capano's wife?&quot;, to make sure. It went to yes.  Now, I don't know if you guys have heard about the famous Capano guy...he and his family own a lot of housing developments, etc. He was charged with killing his wife and throwing her body in the water. Well, we kept on asking her questions, and she spelled &quot;wait&quot;. So my girlfriend asked her why, and she spelled out &quot;rain&quot;. I asked her if she didn't like the rain, and it went to no. My girlfriend then asked her, &quot;Is it because it reminds you of when you were killed?&quot;, and it spelled out yes.  Then I asked her if she is the one making noises in my apartment. She spelled out no. Then she spelled out &quot;Sarah.&quot; Apparently the spirit that caused the noise in my apartment was that of a little 5 year old girl.  My girlfriend asked her if there was a bad spirit in this apartment and it went to yes. Well, let's just say I got a little freaked out!  Then it went to goodbye.
<br><br>
Now I believe it was Capano's wife, and coincindently I live in one of Capano's family housing developments!&quot;
