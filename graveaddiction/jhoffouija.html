On June 27, 2006 I received an e-mail from Julia Hoffman about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Nearly 20 years ago, four of us shared an apartment.  It was Melissa, Scott, Ted, and I.  Melissa and I have always been interested in the supernatural...the guys not so much.  Anyway, Melissa bought a ouija board and started playing with it...by herself in her room.  It nearly got to be an addiction for her.  She said she would get off work or school and rush home to play...it was all she could think about.  Her room was next to mine and I started having weird things happen.  Like I would put something down and it would disappear a second later.  I also started to feel like I was being watched, and my dog started having fits every now and then.  I confided to Melissa about this stuff and she told me what she had been doing with the ouija board, and she also was experiencing a lot of weird stuff.  The weird stuff kept intensifying for us...we didn't say anything to the guys because they were rarely ever at home.  I was walking my dog once and I kept hearing footsteps walking behind me but there was no one there, it was very disconcerting.
<br><br>
Then Melissa was approached by a woman, while she was at work, who told her she was a psychic and that Melissa had a male spirit following her.  After questioning the woman to make sure she wasn't a nutjob, Melissa asked her who he was and if she could tell her anything else.  The woman said that the man had no business being there and would certainly start causing problems if he hadn't already, and she sensed he was not a nice spirit.  She felt she should warn Melissa.
<br><br>
I was working on a psychology degree at a huge university so I decided to make an appointment with one of my professors who was a member of a ghosthunters society in his spare time.  I told him about all the weird stuff going on and what Melissa had been doing.  He said he thought that was really dangerous on her part, he believed she had channeled the spirit through the ouija and now it was stuck.  He said the best thing to do would be to destroy the board or to give it away.
<br><br>
One Saturday night I was stuck home alone working on a paper.  The lights went out although there wasn't a storm (I checked the break box and it was fine).  Then the whole atmosphere in the apartment seemed to change.  It was very heavy, cold, and terrifying.  My dog was going crazy.  I was the most scared I had ever been in my life...and I totally felt someone was there watching me, like right next to me. I waited an hour and it did not subside, so I grabbed my dog and went to my parents house and spent the night.
<br><br>
The next morning I told Melissa that we needed to do something or I was moving out.  We also filled the guys in on everything and of course they thought we were insane, but agreed to go with us to burn the board. So we piled in the car and drove over to an abandoned parking lot, torched the ouija, and we all said a prayer.  Melissa told the spirit to leave.
<br><br>
Our little ritual seemed to work.  The apartment returned to normal and we weren't bothered by anything again.  To this day I will have nothing to do with ouija boards!
