On June 8, 2006 I received an e-mail from Nadia Justice about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I don't know if this story is true or not, but it has been consistantly told by my mother, grandmother, and her best friend, Dev.
<br><br>
My mother and Dev were playing with an Ouija Board when they were about 15 years old. My grandmother is a very religious woman, and she had warned them not to play since she believed it was &quot;black magic.&quot;  Neither believed that the board worked, or even in spirits or magic at that time so they had little or no fear of the consequences.
<br><br>
They began playing, and were asking the usual dumb questions that people ask like, &quot;Who will I marry?&quot; and &quot;How many kids will I have&quot;..etc.<br><br>
My mother had never met her grandmother since she had passed away before my mother was born, had only seen pictures.  None-the-less, my mother had always wanted to meet her.<br><br>
My mother called to my great-grandmother and asked her to show herself.<br><br>
According to Dev, my mother was very very insistant and when she got no answer, my mother abruptly closed the board and didn't say goodybye.
<br><br>
That night my mother was lying in bed, dead asleep, when she awoke suddenly and saw her grandmother sitting on her bed.  Her grandmother said (quite sternly, as the story is told), &quot;I am trying  to rest, DO NOT call me again.&quot;  My mother ran screaming from the room to my grandmother's bedroom. When my mother told my grandmother the story, my grandmother simply said, &quot;I told you so.&quot;
<br><br>
To this day, my grandmother doesn't allow Ouija boards into her house (or her company for that matter) and my mom can't even get near one without getting the chills.
