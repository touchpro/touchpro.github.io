On September 19, 2009 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is some new info, part 2 of my earlier ouija story: &quot;Talking to a Friend in Hell.&quot; These are my friend's messages to me in his own words.  Word for word...
<br><br>
I recently communicated with Drew and have some new information.   I talked to Drew on the board, and he said that he was incorrect on one thing that he told me earlier.  He said that only part of hell is covered with brimstone and fire.  Other parts look just like a regular neighborhood, but no sun or moon or stars in the sky.  It is pitch black and the only light they have is the light given off from the fire.  Drew said that he was thrown into a lake of fire before.   He suffered for years; he didn't tell me how many years he was in there, but he also said that time goes by faster in hell (that's what he told me). Drew even warned me that it was Satan's will for me to talk to him as it is an attempt to get me into hell. He said that ALL spirits on the ouija board, NO EXCEPTIONS, are either from hell or limbo.
<br><br>
He said that spirits in heaven are not permitted to talk through the ouija board.  He also said that all spirits and everyone in hell, including him, are considered demons.  Once you're in hell, you are a demon. He said that not only can he be in two places at one time, but he can also be in multiple places at one time as well, which sounds amazing.  He told me that some people that you see on the streets are not humans, but are very powerful demons that are there to influence people to do bad things. Drew said that it is true that they do have spiritual battles, but he has only fought other demons though.  He said that he gets into fights all the time in hell and likes it, but he doesn't like the torture.
<br><br>
I also learned that there is another realm, and it is called purgatory by humans (note that I said humans).  It is where the saved spirits by God are sent to be tortured for their sins, but it is only temporary and everyone in purgatory goes to heaven. Purgatory is the realm where we are punished for the last bit of sins we have, and made into perfect angels because to enter the holy kingdom one must be perfect.
<br><br>
And there is beer in hell, because beer is an invention by the devil used to poison humans because we tend to be stupid when we are drunk and easy to manipulate (but wine is created by God and not to be overly consumed like beer).  Drew also told me something weird two weeks ago when I last talked to him.   He said 'Dont- let-him-scare-u' and then he stopped talking to me, and I put the board away.  Later that night as I went to sleep, I had a vivid dream where I was walking with my girlfriend and she told me to stop using the board to talk to Drew.  I asked her, &quot;How do you know Drew????&quot; She then looked at me and her face turns pale white, veins started to become visible and the color in her eyes turned gray. She then screamed in a deep voice, something I didn't understand (different language I guess), and pushed me. I then jumped out of bed in a cold sweat, almost in tears.
<br><br>

I think it might have been a demon or something, but to this day I'm still afraid to go to sleep.
