On August 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Sydney about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Sydney, and I went to Wesley Island to my friend Caroline's camp with my friends Lauren, Taylor, and Bre. Caroline had told me how old the camp was, so we decided that I would bring my Ouija board.
<br><br>
It was still daylight, and we were already having weird expiriences with it. All of a sudden, when Caroline and I were in the back room, the box it was in fell perfectly face up on the floor in front of us. It really freaked us out. But we still ended up doing it later.
<br><br>
We sat (as in me, Bre, Taylor, Caroline, and her sister. Lauren was too scared) around the Ouija board and started to talk.
<br><br>
Sam: Is anyone here?<br>
(no answer)<br>
<br>
Bre: Is anyone here?<br>
Spirit: yes<br>
Spirit: Toby<br>
<br>
We all greeted the ghost who we came to know as Toby. We kept asking questions.<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Toby: 24 1/2<br>
<br>
Me: Was your death accidental?<br>
Toby: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who killed you, if we can ask that?<br>
Toby: friend.<br>
<br>
Caroline: Your friend killed you?<br>
Toby: Dad.<br>
<br>
Me(with tears in my eyes): How did your dad kill you?<br>
Toby: Gun<br>
<br>
Me: Your father shot you?<br>
(by now I was really sad for him)<br>
Toby: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Was he drunk?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
We all said that we were sorry for him.  I felt really upset and sad for what happened.<br>
<br>
Me: Were you married?<br>
Toby: No<br>
<br>
Me: Were you in love?<br>
Toby: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What was her name?<br>
Toby: Yelena DcC -(he didn't finish the name)<br>
<br>
The weird thing was that Sam, who by now was scared out of her mind, has a best friend named Yelena.<br>
<br>
Me: Were you going to ask her to marry you?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die before you had the chance?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
We all said we were sorry for him again.<br>
<br>
Me: What's your last name?<br>
Toby: Gains.<br>
<br>
Me (because I was honestly curious): Do you have brown hair and brown eyes?<br>
Toby: yes.<br>
<br>
(I was extremly happy, for I have a weakness for guys with brown hair and brown eyes. Hahah)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like all of us in this room?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you graduate from college?<br>
Toby: yes.<br>
<br>
(in the middle of us asking another question, he randomly writes something)<br>
<br>
Toby: May 31<br>
<br>
Me: What? Is that when you graduated?<br>
Toby: No.<br>
<br>
And then he said goodbye. But then the next day, which was May 31st, we were all freaked. So we ran back to where we were doing it last night and tried to get a few more answers.<br>
<br>
Me: Toby, is there something bad that's gonna happen today?<br>
Toby: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are we in danger?<br>
Toby: yes<br>
<br>
That's all he could say for it was daylight and he was weak. So we had to go to Bre's camp, and we were all scared out of our minds, because we also had to cross a bridge.  We thought everything before was scary, but when we got to Bre's, it was worse...<br>
<br>
We decided to get out the Ouija board again, and we played.<br>
<br>
Me: Who's here?<br>
Spirit: Cee<br>
<br>
Me: How'd you die?<br>
Cee: Gun<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know Toby Gains?<br>
Cee: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Is Toby with us too?<br>
Cee: yes.<br>
<br>
And then we all squealed &quot;TOBY!&quot; because we were happy about seeing our ghostly friend from earlier.<br>
<br>
We also found out from Cee that she was related to Toby. They were brother and sister. I asked the question that had been burning in the back of my mind the whole time.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you in any relation to anyone here?<br>
Toby: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Who?<br>
Toby: Sydney<br>
<br>
Me (I was sobbing uncontrollably): How?<br>
Toby: sister.<br>
<br>
I found out that in my last life, I was Toby and Cee's sister.  And so were Bre and Caroline, for we were triplets. It turns out that our father shot and killed us at Toby's graduation party.  Me, Caroline, and Bre were only 7 years old when we died.<br>
<br>
We looked outside and we took notice to the weather.  It was getting really stormy out, and we were on a river edge.  We went out to go be with our family, but the door wouldn't open. Freaked out, we asked Toby if he was holding the door shut.  He said yes, saying that it wasn't safe to leave quite yet.  So we stayed put and ended up talking to some other people, those of which we knew, except for Taylor...our guardian angels.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Barbara Jean LaRochelle?<br>
(she is my grandmother and I called her Baba.)<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Baba, do you know I'm sorry for what I said when you died?<br>
Baba: yes<br>
<br>
Me (by now I was hysterical): Do you know I miss you?<br>
Baba: yes<br>
Baba: I will keep you safe.<br>
<br>
Then Bre talked to her Aunt Sue, who committed suicide due to alleged medical problems.  Their conversation pretty much was the same thing, as was Lauren's and her great uncles. But Taylor's was a little scary...<br>
<br>
Taylor: Is my guardian angel here?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Taylor: What is your name?<br>
Board: Deves Kift.<br>
<br>
Taylor: Do I...do I know you?<br>
Board: Tetu<br>
<br>
Taylor: What does that mean?<br>
Board: Tetu<br>
<br>
And then we said goodbye while Taylor asked her family if they knew anyone with the name Deves Kift.  Her parents got extremely mad for some reason, and told her drop it and leave it alone, and to never touch it again.  We never found out why...<br>
<br>
The storm started to subside, and we asked if we could leave. Toby and others said yes, that it was safe.  We got up to open the door and it opened.  We didn't spend much more time in the room.<br>
<br>
So that was our Ouija expirience.  Take in mind that was a lot of emotional stuff for a bunch of 13 and 12 year old girls.  I decided to share this story in case anyone else ever encountered the spirit of Toby Gains.
