On July 18, 2009 I received an e-mail from Thomas A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It's been a while since I last played with a board, but there is one experience that I wanted to share that happened not too long ago.
<br><br>
It happened at Manikha's first all nighter, and we were all excited. Corey said that he wanted to bring his Ouija board over, but Manikha wasn't too thrilled at the thought.  So I printed out all the guidelines and rules off of this site and gave them to her. After reading over them and laughing at a few of them, she was fine with the idea. That weekend, we waited until it got really dark and really late to play, and Manikha brought out all of her mother's religious stuff to be on the safe side. We went upstairs to the loft area and set everything up. Rachel didn't feel like playing, so she stayed on the side lines and promised to keep notes (after the events, we later found out that her notebook started out as notes and ended up as drawings).
<br><br>
We started to mess around asking random questions like &quot;who are you?&quot; or &quot;what age did you die?&quot; just to have a good time. We should have taken it more seriously and followed the rules, because around 2 in the morning, that is when all the freaky stuff happened. We started running out of questions, so Manikha was about to get into the darker side, despite many protests. The strangest thing happened, without any communication to the board: it started to spell out &quot;don't answer the phone.&quot; Just after it happened, the phone started to ring and we let out a little scream, after all, it startled us. Manikha was about to pick it up, but Courtney managed to grab it before her, and threw it across the room. I guess the board has us a little freaked out. The doorbell soon rang right after, at the same time the board started to spell &quot;don't answer the door.&quot; Corey and I jumped Manikha and grabbed her by the legs before she could reach the stairs. Courtney still had her hands on the board, and she was shouting out the letters that were being pointed to. &quot;Don't make a sound,&quot; was the sentence we received, and we followed the board's advice. The ringing stopped, but was followed by a loud, continuous knocking at the door. It continued for several minutes and eventually stopped. We sat in silence for a few minutes until Courtney's hands started to move again. The pointer thing moved to &quot;goodbye,&quot; and we put up the board. We wanted to go downstairs and see what happened, but Rachel advised us against it, and we all just went to bed. Although after what we went through, it was a restless sleep.
<br><br>
In the morning we found out that there was an escaped prisoner going door to door trying to find a place to hide. Apparently he didn't break in, because the alarms would lead the police to his location. It seemed that the board somehow saved our life in a really crazy way.
