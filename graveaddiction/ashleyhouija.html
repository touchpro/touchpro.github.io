On June 12, 2007 I received an e-mail from Ashley H. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Ashley. I have read a lot of the ouija board stories, and after much thought I decided to share my story with you. If it were ever to be labeled something, I suppose it would be &quot;Possession&quot; because that is what happened. I had spent a few days at my friend Miranda's Grandmother's house.  We were having fun, it was in the summer so it was hot. It was around 9pm
when we came to the subject of spirits. She told me she had a ouija board, but she had never opened it. I was very skeptical as I wasn't sure I believed in what was considered a &quot;game.&quot;
<br><br>
We set up the board and followed the instructions, hardly pressing our hands on the pointer. We asked it a few questions, but no movement. When it finally started moving and answering, we both kept laughing and accusing each other of moving it. We got various people until one spirit kept reappearing but never really making sense. We finally got it to spell out J-A-C-O-B. We began to chit-chat. We soon realized he was very flirtacious and he kept hitting on me. I became more and more intrigued. We asked how he died, and he said in a plane crash. Soon we realized it was around 1:00, so we decided to say goodbye. We told him we would come back tomorrow. He said goodbye and we put the board away and went to bed.
<br><br>
The next afternoon we got on and chatted long into the night. He suggested that he could possess. We were nervous, but excited so I offered to try. I laid down with my hand touching the pointer, but I felt nothing. He said I was &quot;too pure&quot;. So Miranda tried. Ten seconds later she sat up and looked at me strangely, a smile playing upon her lips. She looked me up and down and I
found myself feeling uncomfortable. She asked me &quot;Ashley?&quot; and I realized it had to be Jacob. The Miranda I knew was very girly. She sat proper and always had flowers in her hair. She/he...I'll just say Jacob from now on...sat at the couch beside me with his legs splayed wide. I remember him asking what the crap in his hair was and plucking it out. He began telling me things she never told me, almost making fun of her. I finally had to change into my night clothes. I noticed when I changed my shirt he looked in the reflection at me, racing up to me when I took my bra off. She wasn't a lesbian so I knew it had to be him. I finally asked him to leave her body.  He did. She woke up dazed and asking why it was 2 hours later. I explained, but she didn't quite believe me. He said he wanted to try again. That he missed seeing me. She agreed. He came back and we danced to the radio. Then it all fell apart. Suddenly he grew more demanding and didn't want to leave.  I told him to go but he laughed evilly and said he was going to stay in the body, that the piece in his hand was all he needed to stay in her body, and soon he wouldn't need it. He said he would rape me in my sleep. I tried for an hour to get the piece back. He only taunted me. I finally got it back and he cursed a string of obscenities before collapsing. A confused Miranda looked at me. I was shaking, on the verge of a mental breakdown. For 10 minutes she couldn't get me to give the piece back; I was too afraid it was a trick. Everything was fine after that, though she randomly went up to me and hugged me in a middle of a show and wouldn't let go...I felt the need to impress her...a feeling I only felt around guys I liked.  We went to the board and I asked where Jacob was. What was said next chills me to this day...
<br><br>
Board: &quot;Hello Ashley, so you thought you could get rid of me huh? Well guess again, I'm still in her body haha haha haha.&quot;
<br><br>
I looked at Miranda, but she only looked scared at me back. In anger and fear I told it it wasn't real, and I began touching different places on me, asking what I was touching. Each time it said the right answer, even when I went all the way to the other side of the room.
<br><br>
Miranda thought I was crazy and would never talk to me again. We are no longer friends, sad to say. I asked one of my friends if she was normal when they last saw her. She said that Miranda was normal...although she would say things that had nothing to do with the conversation, and laughing at random moments...
<br><br>
That's my story. You can use it for what it's worth. I promise you it is true, every word.
