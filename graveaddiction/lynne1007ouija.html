On October 11, 2007 I received an e-mail from Lynne about her interesting ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>
I've been using the Ouija board for about a year now and it has given me so much peace and understanding that I wanted to share it with others who have had less than wonderful experiences.  First, let me say, the Ouija board is not a toy.  It is a tool to contact the other side.  I have lost my father, mother, and brother all within the last few years and when I began using the board it was for the sole purpose of contacting them and finding out if they were together and ok.  What I learned has changed my life and wiped away my fear of death.  I use the board often – probably too much – in fact my loved ones living on the other side have told me not to call them so often – they have things to do.  They and I have become so strong that I can work the board by myself.  I'll share a few of my experiences.
<br><br>
The first time was about 4 months after my mother's death, and I was at my aunt's house for Thanksgiving.  We pulled out the old Ouija board because my 80 year old aunt had recently lost her husband (my mom's brother) and we wanted to contact them if we could.  When we began, we asked if there was anyone there and it spelled out Bob.  That was my dad's name.  I was so excited and I asked him if he was alone, he said no and it then spelled out my mother's name and my brother's name.  They told us they were there with us.  I asked my mother if she had seen her new grandson who was born on November 1.  She said yes and spelled out his name and how much he weighed.  She said he was cute but didn't like his name (you would have to know my mom to know that she wouldn't have liked his name! lol).
<br><br>
My aunt decided I had the touch and let me take the Ouija board home.  My brother came out to visit me from Ohio.  Now, my brother is the world's biggest skeptic.  He just didn't want to believe it was real and called it the work of the devil – you know all those things.  Well, he wouldn't even touch it so I did it with my daughter.  My mother came through immediately and told my brother to &quot;Cheer up.&quot;  My brother said, &quot;Ok mom, if this is really you, I want you to tell me what you left at my house the last time you were there.&quot;  (My daughter and I had no idea what she left) I said to my mom, &quot;Do you know what it is?&quot;  She said &quot;yes, it's my lipstick.&quot;  I looked at my brother who just sat there dumbfounded.  I asked him, what did she leave?  He shook his head yes and said it was her lipstick.  But, my brother still wasn't happy.  He then asked, ok what is sitting next to it that belonged to Tom?  (Tom was our brother who passed away)  My mother answered, &quot;Tom's watch.&quot;  Again, the right answer.  My brother came through and told my sister what he used to call her when she was little, a nickname.  He gave the correct numbers my nephew wrote on a piece of paper and wouldn't show them to who was operating the board.  He told my sister where to find her lost kitten.  Everything, and I mean everything (to date), that they have told us has been right – even future things have come true.  They've told me about life on the other side and how wonderful it is.
<br><br>
On my mother's birthday I was feeling down and crying while listening to a sad song.  My mother came through and told me to stop crying, she wanted me to be happy and that I was too emotional.  She kept telling me to turn the song off and when I didn't she just kept repeating turn that song off now.
<br><br>
I was on it one night and someone I didn't know came through.  They started swearing and saying they were bad, etc.  I told them to leave or I'd sick my family living on the other side on him.  He wouldn't leave, then all of a sudden the board started going crazy spelling really fast  – &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;Get out of here,&quot; &quot;Hit the road.&quot;  I didn't know what to make of it.  But it was my brother, he showed up and was running the unknown spirit off.    He stayed with me a while telling me what he was up to on the other side, and telling me now to worry so much about things that were bothering me until he was sure the unknown spirit was gone for good.
<br><br>
So any of you who find the board evil, you shouldn't be using it.  It's not something to fear when a loved one tries to contact you – it's a gift.  It gives me great comfort to know that my mom, dad, and brother are still around me watching over the rest of us until it's time for us to join them.
