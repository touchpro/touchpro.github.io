On November 11, 2005 a few of us got together for a ghost hunt at Greg's house.  He lives in a big, old house that is haunted.  We decided to use the ouija board after conducting an &quot;official&quot; investigation.  We had two separate sessions, this is the second.  We first tried using the 1940's Hasko Mystic Tray Board, but we didn't have much luck with it.  So we switched back to the the 1920's William Fuld Ouija board.  This session lasted at 1 hour, 13 minutes, 9 seconds.
