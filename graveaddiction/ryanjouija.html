On December 3, 2006 I received an e-mail from Ryan Johnson about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I've been reading all the stuff on your site, but my friends and I couldn't find anywhere to buy a ouija board so we made one. We tried using it in a graveyard and it didn't work, so a few nights later we tried it in my dorm room and it worked.  Me (Ryan) and my friends, Becky, Whitney, and Courtney, did it.  First on the board was me, Becky, and Whitney.  Courtney recorded what happened.  Here's what happened...
<br><br>
Us: Is there a spirit here?<br>
Board: (Right away) Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What's your name?<br>
Board:  Ryan (And that's my name...so I thought one of my friends was moving it, but they weren't)<br>
<br>
Us: Are you male or female?<br>
Board: Male<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there anyone with you?<br>
Board: pr<br>
<br>
Us: Could you try again?<br>
Board: dek<br>
<br>
Us:  We don't understand you...do you want to try spelling it out again?<br>
Board: dej<br>
<br>
Us:  Ryan, are you feeling playful tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there any reason you're talking to us?<br>
Board: 30<br>
<br>
Us: We don't understand, Ryan.<br>
Board: Spelled out B-Y-E instead of going to goodbye<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there anybody else here?<br>
Board: Ty<br>
<br>
Us:  Ty, are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there anything you'd like to tell us?<br>
Board:  Stayed at yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is it?<br>
Board:  no movement.<br>
<br>
Us:  Do you want to talk to us Ty?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Then it didn't move for a while.<br>
<br>
Us:  Are there any spirits here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  What's your name?<br>
Board: zez<br>
<br>
Us: Is your name Zez?<br>
Board:  spelled out B-Y-E again<br>
<br>
Then I got off the board and let Becky and Whitney do it while I recorded.<br>
<br>
Us: Are there any spirits that want to talk?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  What's your name?<br>
Board: Ryan<br>
<br>
Us:  Ryan, are you one of our spirit guides?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Who's spirit guide are you?<br>
Board:  5 -- then it went to the middle of the board<br>
<br>
Us:  We don't understand you, could you try again?<br>
Board: su<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there any reason you want to talk to us tonight?<br>
Board:  no movement<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you still with us?<br>
Board:  No movement<br>
<br>
Us: Is there a reason you're communicating with us?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Will you tell us the reason?<br>
Board:  uy<br>
<br>
Us:  Are you having trouble spelling, Ryan?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  How many past lives have you had?<br>
Board:  4<br>
<br>
Us:  Did you know any of us in any of them?<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
Us:  Will you please try again and tell us why you're here?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Go ahead and tell us.<br>
board: U<br>
<br>
Us:  Do you mean Whitney?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  What's the reason you wanted to talk to me?<br>
Board: Tap<br>
<br>
Us:  What do you mean by tap?<br>
Board:  u<br>
<br>
Then it continued on like this, us asking him questions and him replying with just random letters...I don't know what this means, could anyone tell me?
<br><br>
And then when we used it again, it kept going to the letter y when we asked it questions.  It's really confusing us why the ouija board won't talk to us and keeps confusing us.
<br><br>
If you have any advice for Ryan, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">e-mail me</a> and I'll send your advice/tips on to him.
