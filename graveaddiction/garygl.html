<b>Photo taken by Gary W. Royer</b>

<center><img src="./submissions/garygl.jpg" alt="Ghost at Green Lawn Cemetery"></center>
<br><br> 
Gary W. Royer took this photo at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, OH. Specifically, the photo was taken at the  Soldiers' Memorial (the one with cannons) on June 15, 2005 at about 11:30 AM.
<br><br>
If you look closely, you can see a ghostly soldier in the picture.  He is in the tree behind the cannon, about half way up. The first thing that stands out is his rolled-up sleeve.  He is standing with his back against the tree trunk.
<br><br>
Here is a closer photo of the soldier:

A HUGE thanks to Gary for sharing this photo with me to post on the site!
<br><br>
In July 2005 I received the following e-mail from Amy Everett, another website visitor:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I was looking on your website and came upon the picture of the soldier in Green Lawn Cemetery.  I not only saw the soldier in the tree, but also another soldier two tombstones from the left.  Looks like he's
standing above the tombstone with a helmet on.  I cropped the picture and attached it to this email. Just thought it was interesting how many spirits the camera actually catches.</i></blockquote>
<br>
Here is the cropped photo Amy attached:

Gary was studying his photo some more and noticed yet another face:

<br><br>
In October 2006 I received the following e-mail from Heather Emmons:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I was looking at the photo of Green Lawn cemetery, and there is a ghost of a guy hiding behind a grave stone - the first one all the way to the right behind the cannon.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In December 2006 I received the following e-mail from Joe Schmidt:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I was studying the photo, and if you look really closely you can see a soldier-like shadow standing in front of the cannon, just to the right.  It sort of looks like it is lunging.  It seems like it has a backpack on, and is carrying a gun over his left shoulder.</i></blockquote>
<br>
In January 2009 I received the following e-mail from Ryan T:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I see a ghost in the tree to the right of the photo.  The main branch at the bottom left of the tree: follow the branch out about a half of an inch on the photo and you will see the upper half of a soldier with large hat.  He is very small, but visible.  Yet another ghost in the cemetery photo.</i></blockquote>
