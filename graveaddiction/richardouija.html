On November 29, 2004 I received an e-mail from Richard Broadhead about a cool ouija experience he had while staying at a Bed and Breakfast:
<br><br><br>
&quot;We were bored so we decided to make a board and play it...only after I read your stories and loved them!
<br><br> 
We made the board out of and old set of cards that had letters instead of the original and made a yes or no.
<br><br> 
John: Are there any spirits in the house?<br>
Board: yes
<br><br> 
John: Can you spell your name?<br>
Board: FI
<br><br> 
(Board went dead so we put the cards away.   We then started placing the cards out face down and turning them over 1 by 1. The cards had 3 of every vowel and 2 of every other letter except w and x only 1 of those.  We don't know how it happened. I've edited it to just show the messages)
<br><br> 
John: What was your name?<br>
Board:  fiona
<br><br> 
John: How did you die?<br>
Board: fiona murdered in this house
<br><br> 
john and me: Were you murdered or was it suicide?<br>
Board: killed by man
<br><br> 
John: what room did you die in?<br>
Board:  i died in room..(we got freaked out i was in 9 he was in 10) TEN
<br><br>
(we kept trying but it was a while before the messages started again)
<br><br> 
John: where did you live?<br>
Board: huddersfield (where i lived)
<br><br> 
John: how did you die?<br>
Board: strangled for sex (strangled spelt backwards)
<br><br> 
John: how old were you?<br>
Board:  i was eighteen
<br><br> 
John: what year did you die?<br>
Board: two thousand
<br><br> 
John: do you want to tell us anything?<br>
Board:  enough, said goodbye
<br><br> 
That was the end but we still can't explain it. Like I said, I edited all the words out leaving just the messages. But if that isn't wierd I dunno what is!&quot;
<br><br>
On January 4, 2005 Richard sent me an update to his story:
<br><br>
&quot;After re-reading an email I checked up and guess what...there WAS a Fiona who stayed in the coach house!  She WAS strangled for sex, but it wasn't until I learned the exact date. The land lady I know now took over in 2000. I was suspicious enough to check it out.  Wanna hear the scariest bit?  She died on August 22nd...MY BIRTHDAY!!  How freaky is that?!  I couldn't belive it! I found this out a couple of weeks ago and thought you may wanna know that it is true.  I used to be an atheist...trust me when I say I'm not anymore!&quot;
