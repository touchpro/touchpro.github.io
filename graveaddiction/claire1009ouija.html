On October 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Claire about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hi, I'm Claire and I'm 11. I was at my friend Esme's house with my friends Esme, Sarah, and Zoe. We went to her dad's room to play ouija, which I have been excited and researching about for a while. I explained a few things just in case - i.e. that they shouldn't go through the entire alphabet or else something bad happens, and if the ghost says something about an &quot;attic&quot; it's also bad. Here was the experience:
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone here tonight?<br>
Board: (slowly moves to yes)<br>
<br>
Me: Can we have your name?<br>
Board: (goes to F; pauses)<br>
<br>
Sarah: Fag?<br>
Me: SARAH! (at this point I don't remember exactly what I said, I just yelled at Sarah about being respectful)<br>
Board: F....C....<br>
<br>
Me: Would you like to try that again?<br>
Esme: Claire, so polite.<br>
Board: (slowly, sort of clumsily) Dru.<br>
<br>
Zoe: Are you a boy or a girl?<br>
Esme: G for girl - B for boy.<br>
Board: G<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like Chet Baker? [I am *obsessed* with Chet Baker]<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
[everyone laughs]<br>
<br>
Esme: Do you like Claire?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Esme: Why? Go to F if it's because she's freaked out, A if she's annoying, or O for other.<br>
Board: F<br>
<br>
Me: Oh, I'm sorry...I like you, Dru!<br>
Zoe: How old are you?<br>
Board: 69<br>
<br>
[all of us murmur stuff like &quot;wow&quot;]<br>
<br>
Esme: Wait, were you 69 years...when...you died? Or was it 69 years ago?<br>
Zoe: She means were you 69 years of age when you died or-?<br>
<br>
[we all kinda try to ask]<br>
<br>
Me: Are we confusing you?<br>
Board: [quickly] No<br>
<br>
Sarah: Do you like me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sarah: Zoe?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sarah: Esme?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sarah: Claire?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sarah: Who are you sitting closest by?<br>
Board: CL<br>
<br>
Me: (nervously) Would...you like to try that again...?<br>
[no movement- Sarah laughs at me]<br>
Sarah: On her right or left?<br>
Me: Shut up.<br>
Board: L<br>
<br>
[I was sitting on the left side of the board - on the right would have been where the board was]<br>
<br>
Me: So you don't like me?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
[at this point someone accidentally took their fingers off so we didn't get to say goodbye. I hurriedly re-did the Oujia ritual]<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to Dru?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to Dru, please?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Can we have your name?<br>
Board: C...o....<br>
<br>
Sarah: Is that a Q?<br>
Zoe: No it's over &quot;O.&quot;<br>
Me: Would you like to try that again?<br>
Esme: Claire, so polite...<br>
Board: Cody<br>
<br>
[I look at Sarah - she's obsessed with a kid named Cody]<br>
<br>
Zoe: How old were you, Cody?<br>
Board: 13<br>
<br>
Me: Sarah, stop. [accusing her of moving the board - I saw her wrist moving]<br>
Sarah: Oh, cool, he was our age!<br>
<br>
At that point, I don't quite remember what happened. Zoe took the board on her own (we were still in the room) and asked for Dru. Instead, the board said No and she asked if it was a good or bad spirit - B for Bad, G for Good. It slowly and steadily went to B and she threw the planchette at the wall, then said Goodbye. We never got to say goodbye to Dru, and I know Dru doesn't like me...
<br><br>
I'm scared!
