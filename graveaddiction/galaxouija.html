On June 18, 2005 I received an e-mail from Galaxy about a very interesting ouija board experience she had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Two years ago I was dating Michelle.  Michelle's best friend Gabby had passed away from an overdose.  One day Michelle and I decided to take a trip to San Diego where we'd stay with another friend, Camille.  At Camille's I noticed a Ouija board on the bookshelf, Michelle was in the shower, I thought we should mess with it!  While I was in the shower Michelle had seen the board too-she is not one who believes in spirits, magic, etc.  She too thought we should mess with it.  
<br><br>
We went out and had a few drinks, back at Camille's we pulled out the Ouija board.  We asked &quot;Is there anyone who'd like to speak with us?&quot;  (This is Michelle's first time on the Ouija board ever).  The board begins spelling something out, but I'm having a hard time figuring it out.  We ask again, &quot;Can you tell us who you are?&quot;  Michelle suddenly gets this look on her face and looks at me she says &quot;Thats F'd up!  Whoever is doing that stop cause that's really F'd up!&quot;  I have no idea what she's talking about but Michelle blurts out &quot;It's spelling out Gabby...and if one of you two is doing that- stop!&quot;  I suddenly see the board IS spelling out Gabby.  Crazy!  Michelle, testing us takes her hands off the board, Camille and I continue leaving our hands on the glider.  Michelle is asking questions. She asks &quot;What's the password to your email address that I had to break into after you passed away?&quot;  Board: dukeofearl.  Michelle nods her head-the answer is correct.  Michelle asks again, &quot;What is the nickname you used to call me that nobody else knew?&quot;  Board:Pigeon.  Again Michelle nods her head-the answer is correct.  Michelle is very alert by now because neither myself nor Camille knew the password or the nickname before the board spelled it out.  We also ask if she overdosed on purpose and it spells out 'Accident'.  We asked if she accidentally took more than she usually did.  The board answered 'Yes'.  Interestingly Gabby, being a person who wrote alot in journals etc.,  never left a note as to why she was planning to overdose. We believe that if she had purposely overdosed she would have left a note.&quot;
