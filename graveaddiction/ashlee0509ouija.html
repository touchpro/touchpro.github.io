On May 26, 2009 I received an e-mail from Ashlee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Jamie and I were in my room, and we decided to play the ouija board.  The first time we did it, we got someone who knew Kurt Cobain.  We asked if we could speak to him. Here's how it all went:
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: Eric Panir<br>
<br>
Me: When did you die?<br>
Eric: 1856<br>
<br>
Me: What happened to you?<br>
Eric: Car crash<br>
<br>
Me: Where did you die?<br>
Eric: In Barre<br>
<br>
At this point Jamie could easily tell what it would say, but we were still freaked out because we live in Barre. By now our friend's dog that my family was watching for them was barking and whining and trying to get out of the cage.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you annoyed by our dog?<br>
Eric: Yes<br>
<br>
I looked over to the dog, Apache, and told him to shush. He immediately stopped. But both me and Jamie let go to light up our cigarettes, and he was instantly gone. I looked over to Jamie and smiled as I took a drag. We put out fingers back on and I spoke again.
<br><br>
Me: Can we speak with Kurt Cobain?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Is he unavailable?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
I began to speak, but Jamie interrupted.<br>
<br>
Jamie: Wait! Is he in Hell?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
We talk to a few more ghosts after that, one named Nick, another named Brad. They weren't very talkative and had said goodbye. Then we got to Mel, a female ghost who seemed friendly but knew exactly what Jamie was thinking.<br>
<br>
Jamie: How did you die?<br>
Mel: Elevator.<br>
<br>
Jamie: Can you read my mind?<br>
Mel: Yes.<br>
<br>
Jamie: What am I thinking about?<br>
Mel: Alex<br>
<br>
Jamie: Alex who?<br>
Mel: Kelly<br>
<br>
Me: Were you thinking about him?<br>
Jamie: Earlier!<br>
<br>
Me: Who am I thinking of?<br>
Board: Jaron.<br>
<br>
Jamie: That's who I was thinking of!<br>
Me: I was so not thinking of that!<br>
<br>
Me: Can you read my mind?<br>
Mel: No<br>
<br>
Jamie: Can you read mine?<br>
Mel: Yes.<br>
<br>
We looked at each other like...wtf? After more failed attempts, Jamie asked who she would marry.<br>
<br>
Jamie: Who will I marry?<br>
Mel: Steven<br>
<br>
Steven is her ex boyfriend, who she finds disgusting.<br>
<br>
Jamie: How many kids will I have?<br>
Mel: 1<br>
<br>
Jamie: When will I die?<br>
Mel: 38<br>
<br>
Jamie: How?<br>
Mel: Murder<br>
<br>
Jamie: Who will do it?<br>
Mel: Steven.<br>
<br>
Jamie: Goodbye<br>
Mel: Goodbye<br>
<br>
We took a break and got some food.  When we came back my room was mess. The ouija board was intact and not touched. We ignored the mess, and went back to it and found a ghost named Brad had come.  It was the second Brad. He said he died in a car crash, was 18, died last year, was in love with Jamie, and was very jealous of any guy she went out with. We got freaked out and stopped. When we came back, he was still there and decided he would leave.  He said that we released him and would be stalking her, and was going to follow her home. Soon after we put it away, and I had to take her home hoping that the water we would pass over would keep him away.
