On May 22, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kristin Marie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hi,I'm Kristin Marie. Me and my friend Nino, who lives next door, decided to play the ouija board.  She knows she has a ghost in her house. For me, it was mainly because I wanted get ahold of my dad's spirit.  I miss him a lot. Anyway, moving on to the story. We were reading stuff online on google about ghosts, and Nino got the idea to play the ouija board. We went online to see how we could make our own.  So we wrote down all the letters and numbers and yes, no, etc.  We started playing, and it was getting freaky, but I kept on thinking she is the one moving it. I didn't say anything, just went along going, &quot;oh scarry ghost!&quot;  I was a bit freaked out though because she told me it was a Incubus. I have heard of the great amazing band, but never heard of the demon. If you don't know what an Incubus is, it's a demon that rapes you in your sleep, etc.  So I was pretty freaked out and that night, and I couldn't sleep because I was scared.
<br><br>
The next day I went over to her house, and we decided to play it again. Only at her house this time.  She told me that she and her brother and a few friends were playing at her house, and her ghost was named Nelson.  Her mom came in while they were playing, and she freaked out though. Her mom refuses to let her play the ouija board at all.  When I came over, her brother had the game the whole day.  He told me about his event with the ouija board.  Earlier, he  went to his friend's house, Alex, who was Asian. Apparently he has a very evil spirit in front of his house, and it told him to leave now. So he did. And it came right home with him.  I thought he was kidding since the board didn't work for us. It seriously seemed like my friend Nino was moving the glass piece.  So I just brushed it off.  Anyways, after that we were playing, and this ghost named Bobby asked us if we were gay. I thought it was Nino trying to be funny, me and her brother started laughing our asses off.  Seriously? Well, wouldn't you laugh too if a ghost asked &quot;are you gay?&quot;
<br><br>
About half an hour into playing with the ouija board, Alex, Nino's brother's friend, came by.  We started playing, and suddenly another ghost started talking to us. He said his name was Alex, and all of us looked up at the Asian Alex.  We all started saying stuff like, &quot;Dude, are you moving it?  Seriously!&quot;  Anyways, we asked how this &quot;Alex&quot; died, and he started saying, &quot;I'm not dead.&quot; So we all looked up to alex again, going &quot;dude, are you moving it?  Seriously! This isn't funny.&quot;  He claimed he was not moving it.  Nino's brother, Isaac, decided to ask, &quot;Where are you at then, Alex?&quot; He replied, &quot;next to Nino.&quot;   We all looked up at the Asian Alex again, and asked him to stop moving it.  He was siting next to Nino, and I was sitting next to Nino, and Isaac was sitting next to me.  While they were all fighting, I asked the spirit if he meant between me and Nino.  He answered yes.  After that we freaked out.  Then suddenly, &quot;Alex&quot; kept on mentioning &quot;I miss my mom, I love my mom, help me find my mom&quot; and stuff. We decided to ask this ghost how old he was, and he replied &quot;5.&quot;  He didn't know he was dead. And how I knew this Alex was really here was because the glass piece was moving so fast and strongly I couldn't even keep up, unless my friends were to tell me what he was saying. It would answer so quickly! For example:
<br><br>
Alex was trying to describe his mother:
<br><br>
Alex: s-h-e-h-a-s-r-e-d-h-a-i-r.<br>
Me: And green eyes?<br>
<br>
*glass piece moved imeddiately to yes*<br>
<br>
And so on and on.<br>
<br>
We would asked if he used to live in this house, and he answered yes.  I asked him what year it was for him, and he said 1925.  I was scared! He told us the last thing he remembered was his mom was cooking, and a bad man took his mother away.  He remembered being in his room, and he wanted us to go look for his mom.  He still doesn't know where he is.  Then we continued and asked him how he doesn't know. I commented going, &quot;don't worry, Alex, you will find her one day.&quot; Then he would answer &quot;It has been 20 years,& and going &quot;help me, its dark, I'm scared.&quot;  He continued on with that until he was saying, &quot;help me, bad people are coming.&quot;  Isaac freaked out and went to goodbye, because he knew that the glass piece would go across the numbers.  He freaked out and screamed. &quot;OMFG, OK, we are not playing this anymore, nope we are not playing anymore! Nope, never.&quot;
<br><br>
After that I was scared. I feel sorry for Alex and want to help him, but we are all scared that if he doesn't accept that he is dead, he will start terrorizing us. Because you know how ALIVE 5 years olds are. I don't want to know what a 5 year old ghost might do.  So please do give some advice, because me and my friends are scared and feel sorry for this poor little boy.
