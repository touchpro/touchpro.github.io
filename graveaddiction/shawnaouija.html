On October 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Shawna Beeman about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Hey. I'm Shawna and I came across your website searching for Ouija stories. I have one of my own.
<br><br>
This Happened In Newark, New York (not New York City)
<br><br>
It all started when my friend, Emmy, and I went yard sale-ing and found this board. We asked why they were getting rid of it, and the girl running the sale said she was scared of it and never used it. We bought it and went to the next sale, finding a box of free candles and candleholders (weird, huh). We went back to my house and invited our friend Amber over to use it with us. We started our session at about 9:00 PM. It didn't work at all.
<br><br>
In the morning, we went to my grandmother's house for awhile. We took the board into the woods behind her house, and we all put two fingers on the planchette and waited. We said things like: if you are here, point to Ouija and if you are willing to talk point to yes. It didn't work for about fifteen minuets.  Then, as we were about to give up, it started moving. We all accused each other of moving the planchette. Then I asked who I was going to marry. It replied Amber. Then Amber asked who she was going to marry....it said her boyfriend, Andy. Then I asked again, and it replied my boyfriend Alex. Then Emmy asked the name of her grandmother it replied correctly. Then we put it away.
<br><br>
The next day I went back to my grandother's house and there was a corner missing on the board. The left hand corner to be exact - fresh chopped too (we never found the corner that was chopped off and I swear to god we bought the board in perfect condition). This was about two weeks ago, and Emmy's grandmother died last week.  I haven't been able to sleep since I've used the board.
