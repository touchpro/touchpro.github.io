On November 10, 2005 I received an e-mail from Gryphon about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I was using the Ouija board for the first time just the other week and this totally freaky weird thing happened.  Since then Brenda, my sister, and Kyle, my best friend, won't touch an ouija board again...though they used to play all the time when Brenda got her's for her birthday a few months ago. I always just watched, but the other week I finally agreed to get in on the game and oh boy was it scary!
<br><br>
We went into the attic of our house, where we have a lot of old toys and my parents have stuff from all the rummage sales they've gone too. They collect things and try to sell other things, so a lot of it we just store up
there until someone buys it. It's always really creepy in there just because there's so much stuff that doesn't belong to us.
<br><br>
So anyway, we laid out the ouija board on an old footstool and we lit a candle for each of us.  Then Kyle used it first.
<br><br>
Kyle: Is there anyone in the room with us right now?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Kyle: I don't believe you if you answer.<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Kyle: Are you male or female?<br>
Board: Kjklzcaf<br>
<br>
Kyle: Sorry, could you try again? Are you male or female?<br>
Board: Kill<br>
<br>
Brenda: Oh my god Kyle, you just did that didn't you?<br>
Board: No. (the pointer spun out of his fingers and pointed at Brenda. Kyle grabbed it back up again)<br>
<br>
Kyle: That's not funny. Is there anything you want to tell us?<br>
Board: Igv<br>
<br>
Kyle: Try again, is there anything you want to say?<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
So I tried next.
<br><br>
Me: Hello?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: I'm Gryphon, what's your name?<br>
Board: Kill<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you keep saying that? Do you want to kill us?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Were you killed?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
Board: murrd<br>
<br>
Me: Were you murdered?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How were you murdered?<br>
Board: knid<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Board: 78902abv<br>
<br>
Me: Did you do that on purpose?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why can't you spell right?<br>
Board: hads<br>
<br>
Me: Hads?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Brenda: Hands?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: You have no hands?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Brenda: Were they cut off with a knife?<br>
Board: Yes (The planchette moved from my hands and pointed at Brenda again)<br>
<br>
Me: Stop that! Do you think Brenda did it?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What are you pointing at?<br>
Board: Knife<br>
<br>
Brenda: The knife is in this room?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
The planchette started moving really fast, then spelling &quot;Kill&quot; over and over again. I pressed on it hard to stop it, and moved it to Goodbye.  Then we heard a bang from behind Brenda in the attic. Kyle and I went to look and one of the dressers my parents had gotten at an auction was open.  Inside was this really old rusty knife. We blew out the candles and left after that. No one wants to go back into the attic.
