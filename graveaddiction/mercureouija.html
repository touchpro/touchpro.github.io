On October 3, 2005 I received an e-mail from R. Mercure about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Okay...I've been reviewing your site because my sister just got a ouija board, and she has always, always been into that.  When we were little, this sounds weird, but my mom would have her cards read, and she'd try to get in contact with my grandpa, who died so many years ago.  My sister was 2 at the time, and she went to see my mom.  She got distracted, and she'd talk.  So my sister has always been into supernatural stuff.  
<br><br> 
I had a party because I was up in Canada and it was my last few days there.  I decided to have my friends over.  Well, my best friend Kylee has an ouija board, and she brought it.  It had to have been like 11:00 or something because it was dark, and my dad, being the most religious guy I know, practically won't allow it in his house.  So we did it outside on the patio table...we lit a red candle, and we started.  I have always been told it was mind over matter, and that our muscles were the movement of the little arrow thinger.  But when I actually tried it for the first time, I knew it wasn't - it was like I wasn't even touching it, and I asked it questions about me, and it always knew.  Then I got curious, so we started asking it obsurd questions about ourselves and our futures.  We all got kinda scared, we started going into the actual questions of the spirit.  We asked the personal questions, and usually the spirit gets mad, or starts to mess with you, right?  Well the spirit started to mess with us - it told us the information we asked, like it had given Ky and her mom before us, but he pretended to get really mad.  For some reason we asked if he was gonna hurt us, he said no.  Then we heard something move in my neighbor's bush.  We asked what it was, and the board spelled out EVIL.  My friend screamed.  Then we changed the topic, and asked why it wouldn't talk when Sam {my other friend} was holding it.  It said she didn't believe enough, and the only way it would actually believe she was serious was if she would perform a ritual.  All confused, we asked what it was, and it told her to pour the candle wax on the board.  Sam freaked out and said no, and told us to put it away... so we did.&quot;
