On October 13, 2009 I received an e-mail from Francisco V. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is a story my aunt told me one time.  It's about the time her friend decided to use a ouija board.
<br><br>
Friend: Is there anyone here?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Friend: Will you tell me your name?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Board: (gives an address)<br>
<br>
That night he went to the address.  It was a big house; it looked like it had been abandoned for awhile.  The front door was open, so he opened the door.  It was one large room, and there was a window shining moonlight on a book stand.  He walked up to the book stand - it was an open Bible.  As he aproached the Bible, it started to bleed from the center.  He ran out frightened.  The next week, while he was driving on the highway behind an overloaded truck carrying telephone poles, the strap holding the telephone poles broke.  One of the poles flew at him and smashed through his windshelid and stabbed him in the stomach.  He died that day.  There's no doubt in my mind that it was a demon that killed him that day.  Who knows - one day when you use a ouija board you might talk to him.
