On July 6, 2005 I received an e-mail from Maddy Larsen about her very interesting ouija board experience using a homemade board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I made an Ouija board out of leftovers from a science project (thick posterboard) and a paper glued onto it that had the letters, numbers, and words printed on it from my computer. I even carved out a little posterboard planchette. It was a really cheesy attempt, but it actually worked!
<br><br>
I got a friend to play it with me, but she didn't really want to...and I only got a few answers out (singular letters) the entire night. The first question I asked was simply 'is anyone here?' and it went to 'y' instead of yes. 10 questions later I eventually asked if it was good or bad, it went to 'b'...then I said goodbye. Simple enough, I
wasn't freaked out...but my friend started getting really irritable.  What was really interesting was that when we blew out the candle the smoke kind of formed into a strange face before dissipating.
<br><br>
Another time I tried it out with a different friend, in much the same way (with a candle, and in the same room). Nothing much happened, we asked the name and it said 'Suz', then I asked if it was the same one as the last time and it went to 'y'.  A few more questions, mainly I asked about god. It really wouldn't give me straight answers. At one point I think it went to 'shut the hell up NOW'!  Well, needless to say I was more than a tiny bit scared. (The reason it's capitalized is because I placed both lower case and capital letters on the board. I was very
thorough with including details).
<br><br>
The face I was talking about earlier, by the way, was that of a man. He kind of had an oblong nose and really creepy eyes (because there was a lack of much smoke around that section). But I can't really say much more, because smoke doesn't stay in shapes long enough to get a good glimpse.
<br><br>
It's not a great experience, but it's true. That room is kind of colder now though, I think I invited something there that doesn't want to leave.
<br><br>
I would also like to add that my family is very biased against the board, mainly because of something that happened with my great aunts. I would go over that occurence, but I'm kind of uncomfortable even thinking about it.&quot;
