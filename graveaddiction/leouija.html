On December 8, 2005 I received an e-mail from Liisa Elts about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
We were children back then, and we were having a birthday party. There were 7 of us between ages 7-14. We made our own ouija board (in Estonia I think it's more common to make them ourselves from paper). We did the usual kind-Three circles- one big and two smaller ones in the middle. Up and down we drew three crosses inside the big circle. On both sides we wrote the alphabet and  numbers. We used needle as marker.
<br><br>
We called out a spirit of a local man, who had died not long before (we keanly kept to the law that you should not call out spirits who have been away from their body less than 3 months). We knew nothing of him, but we knew that our parents, who were having coffee in other room, knew him quite well.  It was quite suprising that he answered. We asked him some usual questions, like
when were you born, why did you die, how many children did you have and such. Then we let him free and put the board aside.
<br><br>
It was still a birthday party. Then the oldest of us thought it would be interesting to check how much truth was in the spirit's talk, so he went to ask our parents. And he came back looking white as a sheet. All the facts were true.  That shocked us truly, and none of us have ever called out any spirits anymore. We did it earlier, but after that...We burned the ouija board (we always burn them and make new ones for different spirits) and moved on with our lives. But this incident has stayed and none of us take things related to spirits lightly.
