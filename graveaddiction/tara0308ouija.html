On March 31, 2008 I received an e-mail from Tara about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This is a story that happened last Saturday at a birthday party with 12 of my friends.
<br><br>
All 12 of us were sitting around the room in the dark, telling scary experiences we've had in our lives.  Then Kelsey had a story about a spirit she had contacted from a ouija board. Then we all started talking about doing one ourselves, so we made one out of paper for the board and a small piece of cardboard for the planchette.  We all sat in a circle, and it was pitch black except for one small candle beside our paper board. Three people put their hands on the planchette, and Kelsey started to speak.
