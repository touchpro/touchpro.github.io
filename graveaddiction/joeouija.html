On September 8, 2005 I received an e-mail from Joe Bucci about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Last night (Sept 7th) my friends Nicole, Barb, and Matt came over to play the Ouija board with me because of the stories I told them at work.  We wrote most of the Q and As down so here they are:
 
Barb: Is anyone there?<br>
Answer:  n/a (it took about 10 minutes before it started moving and the board only seemed to work if with Nicole or I on it as well, and the spirits did not like Barb)
<br><br> 
Matt: If anyone is there, please go to the first letter of your name.<br>
Answer:  W
<br><br> 
Joe: Could you please spell the rest?<br>
Answer: ILIE (Wilie)
<br><br> 
Question:  Is your name pronounced Willie?<br>
Answer:  No
<br><br>

<br><br> 
Question:  Are you one of our spirit guides?<br>
Answer:  Yes
<br><br>
Question:  Whose, please?<br>
Answer:  Nicole
<br><br>
Barb:  Can Joe take Nicole's place? (She wanted to ask her questions that we didn't know the answer to)<br>

Joe: Is there anything you want to tell Nicole?<br>
Answer:  Yes  
<br><br>
Question:  What?<br>
Answer:  PERHSKOMNJ
<br><br> 
Nicole:  What color did I just paint my room?<br>
Answer:  Green (That was right - none of us knew, and Nicole wasn't on the board, just me and Matt)
<br><br> 
Question:  What is my middle name?<br>
Answer:  Ch no movement after that (Her middle name is Christine)
<br><br> 
Joe:  Where are you right now?<br>

<br><br>
Nicole: Does that mean I won't get wrinkles?<br>

<br><br> 
We then switched so that Barb and Matt were on it but it would not move.<br>
Then Nicole and I got on it, because we forgot to ask if we could switch.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Question:  Could you please say the area code again?<br>
Answer:  412
<br><br>
THAT is the right area code... creepy!
<br><br>
After that, I was like &quot;Do you guys wanna stop playing?&quot; (it was getting late) they said they didn't care, and so I was like, &quot;Do you want to stop?&quot;  And then she (my grandma) moved the Planchette to GOODBYE before we could even decide!
<br><br> 
I called the number she gave... It was not Nicholette's number.&quot;
