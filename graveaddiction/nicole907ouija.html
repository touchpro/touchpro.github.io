On September 1, 2007 I received an e-mail from Nicole about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have gotten really interested in Ouija boards lately, so I decided to make my own out of a cutting board and some saran wrap. I've used it three times so far, although the first time didn't work so well. The second time I used it with my dad and brother, and we talked to a man who was in one of my dad's ghost stories (which I had thought he had made up until then).
<br><br>
The third time was quite entertaining. It was after everyone else had gone to bed, and my brother and I decided to try one more time. We contacted a spirit who at first said he was a walrus in heaven by the name of Pot who had been killed by a monkey named DK. Then he told us he was joking and said he was actually an angel. He said &quot;godwachu,&quot; which we confirmed meant God was watching us (I'm agnostic, so this is interesting). I asked him if he wanted to say anything else, and he told my brother to eat shit, because he didn't like him. After a few more questions, he said he had nothing more to say so we said goodbye.
