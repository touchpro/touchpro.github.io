October has been an extremely busy month, especially with the website.  My hits have almost doubled due to Halloween.  I've been getting a lot of e-mails from site visitors and am really far behind on answering them.  <br /><br />This past Saturday was my family's third annual Halloween bonfire/hayride.  I think everyone had fun.  I was really worried that it would get rained out, but luckily we didn't get a single drop of rain all day.  I was in charge of the decorating, so of course there was a cemetery.  I took some pictures of it, I'll have to post some here tonight<br /><br />Work has been crazy too.  We were told a few weeks ago that our area is overbudget and needs to place 3-5 testers in new jobs by the end of the year.  When we were originally told this they said that if we didn't place them 60 day notices might be given out.  So of course that caused tons of panic.  I wasn't too concerned, afterall, you can only get so worked up...if I'm going to get laid off, there's nothing I can do about it at this point.  Well, when my division manager sent out an e-mail with 2 job opportunities in another area, I responded and said that I'd be interested in talking to the hiring manager.   It made sense since I'm so unhappy at work right now.  My interest in those positions must not have been expected, because next thing you know I had one-on-one meetings scheduled with my division manager and systems officer to discuss my current opportunities within IAS.  Those meetings went pretty good, and I feel a little better about my current job and promotional opportunities.  It's too bad my manager never communicates things the way they do, maybe the whole situation/meetings could have been avoided if he did.  It was nice to be able to talk about things with managers who seemed to care, I'm not used to that!<br /><br />Last week I did my first TV interview!!!  The Fox station in Cincinnati (Channel 19) is doing a story on 10/31 about haunted places/paranormal investigations.  They interviewed me as an &quot;expert&quot; ghost hunter.  They'll cut out bits and pieces of my interview and put them in the story.  Should be pretty cool!  I was really nervous about it...I hate being filmed, but it went very well.  Tom, the reporter, said he'll send me a video of the finished story, I can't wait to see it!<br /><br />I can't think of anything else exciting to write about.  I'll blog again tonight, and share some of the photos of the party decorations.<br><br>

So we had a beautiful weekend weather wise, even Monday was nice.  So yesterday when my team at work had our outing at the pumpkin patch, what was the weather like?  Cold and rainy, of course!  And VERY, VERY muddy!  But we still had fun carving our pumpkins.  I took some photos, you can <a href="hallowork.html">see them by clicking here</a>.  <br /><br />I think I may have a canker sore.  I haven't had one of those for ages, I forgot how much they can hurt.  Hopefully it will go away fast!  I'm not sure what causes them, but my mom said she read that stress is a big factor.  I haven't really been stressed out lately though, so who knows.<br /><br />I'm trying to think if I have anything else exciting to write about.  I honestly can't think of anything, the only thing on my mind right now is that I <b>really</b> need to clean the fish tank tonight, it's looking pretty gross.  I also need to work on getting an update for the site done, I still haven't updated this week!  October has been a busy, busy month.  Next week will be even busier though...it's the weekend of the big cookout.  And believe me, this year it's BIG!  I have a couple friends coming, and my manager is coming too.  That means I won't be able to complain about my job or any of my coworkers :(  Oh well, I'll just talk about cemeteries and ghost stuff instead!  I am bringing the ouija boards, just in case anyone feels like contacting the dead :)  Chris, the leader of the <a href="http://www.shadowseekers.org" target="_blank">Shadowseekers</a> (the people I went to the <a href="moontun.html" target="_blank">Moonville Tunnel</a> with) , RSVP'd for three people, and he specifically mentioned the ouija board.  So maybe I'll have a new ouija story to add to the site in a couple of weeks!<br><br>

Friday night I went to the Ceely Rose play at Malabar Farm State Park.  Malabar Farms was Louis Bromfield's (a Pulitzer Prize winning author) house in Lucas, Ohio (it's near Mansfield).  We toured the house, which was awesome, took a wagon ride through the farm to Pleasant Valley Cemetery, had dinner, and watched the Ceely Rose Play performed by the Mansfield Playhouse.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had a fantastic time!  I'll be putting the photos on the site later this week, but I'll go ahead and give you a brief summary of the Ceely Rose story:<br /><br />Malabar Farm is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Ceely Rose.  In 1896 she murdered her family - her dad, mom, and brother.  Why did she murder them?  Well, she was obsessed with the boy next door, Guy Beery.  Guy was nice to her, so in her head she came to the conclusion that he loved her and wanted to get married.  However, Guy didn't want to get married!  So he ended up telling her that they couldn't get married because her family didn't approve of him, which wasn't true.  Ceely was so mad that she poisoned her family's cottage cheese with rat poison and served it to them for breakfast.  She ended up confessing to the murders and was locked away in an institution for the rest of her life.  And while some may believe the farm isn't haunted, the story is very true...there's no denying that, you can find out the info from court records and newspaper articles!  I'll elaborate on the story when I add it to the site, but that's the condensed version.<br /><br />Saturday my mom and I toured the Georgian, an old mansion, in Lancaster, Ohio.  I had been there before, but it was a LONG time ago.  We had to pick up our tickets for the Heritage Association's cemetery walk there, so we decided to take the tour since we were already there.  It was a lot of fun, I'll be adding those photos to the site as well, probably next week or the week after.  <br /><br />Well, I need to get to work now...it's so difficult to go back after being on vacation :(<br><br>

I had a great time at the fair on Wednesday, the combine demolition derby was awesome!  There were thirteen combines this year, and it was very exciting.  I took a lot of pictures, and a few of them actually turned out.  You can see the photos by <a href="combine.html">CLICKING HERE</a>.  <br /><br />I also took some photos of the animals, you can see them by <a href="fair03.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />I added four new cemeteries to the site tonight too, visit the <a href="newstuff.html">updates</a> page to see the links to those pages.  I am getting behind on my updates again.  I have a bunch of photos to scan from the PA cemeteries, Prospect Place, and the Ohio State Reformatory (I just got them developed last week, having the digital camera has made me lazy when it comes to getting my 35mm film developed!).  I visited five more cemeteries this afternoon, so I have those to add as well.  I'm sure I'll get caught up soon!<br /><br />Well, I'm tired now since I've been up since 8AM....I think it's time for me to go to bed and get some sleep!<br><br>

Having time off work is so wonderful!  I was able to sleep in today, that alone makes having a day off worthwhile.  I think I may work on resizing some photos for the site this afternoon, I still haven't made an update this week.  I'm guessing it will be Thursday or Friday.<br /><br />I really haven't been up to much since the last time I blogged.  I did make nobake cookies last night.  I just felt the need to make something, and I hadn't made those for a long time.  They turned out really good, I ended up eating one for breakfast.  Isn't that a great meal to start out the day?!  <br /><br />I'm going to take the digital camera to the fair with me tonight, and I'll try to get some pictures of the combines at the demolition derby.  That event is always so packed though, the pictures may just turn out to be the back of a bunch of people's heads!  Anyway, I'll be sure to let you know how it went when I blog tomorrow.<br><br>

hahaha, I mentioned the quarter end QC in my last post, and said something about hoping it went smoother than last time.  I read an e-mail Thursday night that said we probably wouldn't be able to start QCing the statements until 4AM-7AM.  So I decided it wasn't necessary to go to bed early.  I cleaned the apartment a little, and went to bed around 10:30PM.  Then I probably layed there thinking for 30-45 minutes before actually falling asleep.  I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing.  I answered it, and it was Deidee...she said the statements for QC would be printed within an hour, so I could get ready to head into work.  I couldn't believe it was 4AM.  And guess what, it wasn't....it was 12:03AM!  I was at my desk by 1:05AM, and stayed there until 7:10AM.  I was sooooo tired!  The six of us who QC the statements had a little fun though.  We were listening to music on this shared drive at work, and let me tell you, it was a BIG variety of stuff.  We even listened to some Italian music, as well as some Spanish music.  &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in Spanish is quite amusing to people who haven't had much sleep!  <br /><br />Anyway, my lack of sleep/changed sleeping pattern really messed up my weekend.  After I got home on Friday morning I immediately fell asleep.  I planned on only sleeping for 3 hours, but my alarm didn't go off (I'm still not sure why) so I ended up sleeping for 6 hours instead.  It was nice to sleep, however, since I slept so long in the morning/afternoon I couldn't fall asleep later that night!  Since I couldn't get my sleeping pattern back to normal I ended up missing Mark's bonfire that I REALLY wanted to go to.  It really makes me mad when I think about it...it's not even like I get compensated at work for doing any of this.  No comp time, no overtime, and I really don't get much of a thank you from management.  Since we do it every quarter I think they're just expecting it of us.  Oh well.<br /><br />Tomorrow night is the combine demolition derby at the Fairfield County fair!!!  I go with my parents every year to see this, it's my favorite!  I'm sure if Chrissie's reading this right now she's laughing and calling me a redneck.  But I can't help it, it's fun :)  I have plans for the rest of the week too...but I'll write about them later so I have stuff to write about later ths week!<br /><br />Well, I need to get back to work now.  I'm on vacation the rest of the week, so all I have to do is make it through today!<br><br>

I found out yesterday that I was quoted in <i>Columbus Monthly</i> magazine.  I received an e-mail from one of their reporters back in August, we did an e-mail interview.  However, after I sent her my answers I didn't hear anything else, so I wasn't sure if they'd be used in her haunted places article or not.  Well, I received an e-mail from Kate yesterday afternoon, and she told me her boyfriend Andy, who is also quoted, told her I was quoted too.  Pretty cool.  I had to go to Barnes and Noble immediately after work to pick up a copy of it (and a few other books)! :) It's a good article, I plan on scanning it and adding it to the site in the near future.  <br /><br />I am loving this weather!  It's been kind of cold the past few days, but it's been sunny.  Of course, it's supposed to rain this weekend...That will probably ruin all of the plans I had. Oh well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the weather forecast will change again.<br /><br />Today we'll start the statements quarter end QC at work.  Those of you who have read the blog since July will know that I dread the quarter end QC, because things always go wrong and I end up spending way too much time at work.  I'm hoping this quarter end will go smoother, but so far it's not looking good.  Oh well.<br><br>
