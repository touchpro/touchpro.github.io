On September 16, 2007 I received an e-mail from Roxanne S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This summer I was staying with my sister Aleisa, and we were having an all around great time. Our cousin Kayla was hanging out with us, and we were just partying. Kayla had brought a Ouija board for us to play with. My sister Aleisa is a very spiritual person, we've visited a ton of haunted places, and have encountered amazing things. This was our first time ever touching a Ouija board. We've always avoided it, knowing the evil that can sometimes come along. My mother, Golda, and my sister's daughter, Kadra, along with her son, Brendan, were all in the room when we played (Kadra is only four, and Brendan is only 5 months old). We allowed Kadra to play the game, since she has always been able to &quot;see&quot; spirits.
<br><br>
People playing = Aleisa, Kayla, Me [Roxanne], Golda, and Kadra.
<br><br>
Aleisa: Is anyone out there?<br>
Board: nothing.<br>
<br>
Kayla: Does anyone wish to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who do you want to talk to?<br>
Board: Aleisa<br>
<br>
Aleisa: I'm here.<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Who is this?<br>
Board: Genesis<br>
<br>
[[Genesis is Aleisa's best friend who died from cancer at the age of 18.]]<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Genesis?<br>
Board: Yes, Genesis Douglas.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Are you happy?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Are you in Heaven?<br>
Board: Yes. It's beautiful.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Did I have a dream about you?<br>
Board: Yes, many.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Are you one of my Guardian Angels?<br>
Board: Yes, always have been.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: [trying to calm down Brendan]<br>
Board: He's sad.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Brendan?<br>
Board: Yes. He's sad.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Why is he sad?<br>
Board: Cause of me.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: You?<br>
Board: I'm cold. I'm making him cold.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Could you help him stop crying?<br>
Board: I'll try.<br>
<br>
We waited, and within 15 seconds Brendan was asleep.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: [crying] Thank you.<br>
Board: Don't cry.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: I'm sorry.<br>
Board: Dont cry, be strong. You must be strong.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Why?<br>
Board: For tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Tomorrow?<br>
Board: Be strong. I love you, Goodbye.<br>
<br>
We continued to play, wondering what could be happening tomorrow. Nothing interesting happened until it got later, it was around 1:00 AM when we started to get stranger things happening.<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Who do you want to talk to?<br>
Board: Kadra.<br>
<br>
Kadra: Uhm...Hi.<br>
Board: Hello sweetie.<br>
<br>
Kadra: Who is this?<br>
Board: Charley.<br>
<br>
Karda: Do I know you?<br>
Board: Not yet.<br>
<br>
Me: She doesn't know you yet?<br>
Board: Nope.<br>
<br>
Me: When will she meet you?<br>
Board: 2009<br>
<br>
Kadra: Will you be my friend?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Kadra: Are you a boy?<br>
Board: No. G.<br>
<br>
Kadra: Oh, girl. How will I know you?<br>
Board: Rickie.<br>
<br>
[[Rickie is Genesis's sister.]]<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Rickie Douglas?<br>
Board: Yes. yes, yes.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Will you be her child?<br>
Board: Her daughter.<br>
<br>
Golda: Do you have something to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes yes yes yes yes. [continued to circle around yes]<br>
<br>
Kayla: What is it?<br>
Board: Bad morning.<br>
<br>
Me: Bad morning?<br>
Board: Bad bad bad.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: What's going to happen?<br>
Board: You.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: ME?<br>
Board: Bad morning, you. you. bad.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: What?<br>
Board: bad<br>
<br>
Aleisa: What's going to happen to me?<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
We were pretty freaked out at this point. But we continued to play.<br>
<br>
Golda: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Devil.<br>
<br>
We said goodbye and were about to put the game away, but Aleisa said to continue playing.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Hello?<br>
Board: Hi<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Are you a bad person?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Why are you here?<br>
Board: You.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Me?<br>
Board: Yes, your naughty you little bitch.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Pardon me?<br>
Board: ha ha ha.<br>
<br>
Aleisa: Are you - [was cut off]<br>
Board: Yes, I'm here. In your hallway.<br>
<br>
We looked in the hallway, and there was a extremely dark spot, all of the lights were on. Aleisa grabbed the camera and snapped a picture, there was nothing there. And when we looked back in the hall, there was nothing there.<br>
<br>
Kayla: Why are you here?<br>
Board: Girls.<br>
<br>
Kayla: Because we're girls?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kayla: Goodbye.<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Kayla: GOODBYE<br>
Board: -planchette hesitated, then moved to Goodbye.-<br>
<br>
We stopped playing the ouija board, and took the board outside and put it in the barbecuer. But did not burn it. We all slept downstairs. And Kadra was clearly terrified, she was shaking all over and mumbling bad morning. I myself was scared. Aleisa was sick after playing the game, we all knew it was because of the alcohol she had been drinking. The next morning, Aleisa had a panic attack, an extremely bad one, she was foaming at the mouth, and looked like she was possessed.  She passed out and was rushed to the hospital. When she returned home, they said it was just an effect from the alcohol. Can spirits predict the future? I'm convinced they can at this point.
