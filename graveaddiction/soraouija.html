On August 14, 2005 I received an e-mail from Sora about her creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;It must have been 2 or 3 weeks ago, I bought a glow in the dark ouija board from the mall. I couldn't get it to work, so my mom did it to show me how. She asked to contact her spirit guide, and a person named Teresa came on. We asked about our cat who had died 9 months or so ago. Both of us had heard a cat meow loudly in the past, and our neighbors have no cats.  Also, there were no cats outside. Teresa told us he was in heaven with all the other animals, and that he will come to meow to let us know he's ok. 
<br><br>
Teresa told me I will be a criminal attorney when I grow up, or be a game designer for NASA. I told her NASA doesn't make games, what do you mean?  And it said graphic designer.  It knew my name, and my aunt and uncle's names.  It said they would be moving. It told my mom she was an &quot;advanced spirit&quot; and that she forgot what she was put on earth to do (she's getting sick of her career). Teresa said my mom will be a book writer and live near a lake. We said bye and closed the board. 
<br><br>
We did it again like 2 days later, and it said &quot;make preparations for an attack on Washington DC&quot;.  Right after it said attack, I went ballistic and started cursing it out thinking it was threatening us. It started spelling out more but we closed it. We have been having some strange things happening in the house now, someone put these sandals right next to my bed when no one moved it.  My TV has turned on by itself. I had a bunch of software in this disc holder thing and the discs had been taken and moved, no one in the house did it. Strange stuff.&quot;
