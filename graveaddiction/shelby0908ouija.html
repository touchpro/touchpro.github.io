On September 6, 2008 I received an e-mail from Shelby about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My best friend, Alli, and I had played the ouija board many times before this experience. We were playing it in her bedroom, and we started talking to this male spirit who claimed his name was R.
<br><br>
Us: How old are you?<br>
Board: 0<br>
<br>
Us: You died before you were born?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Were you going to be a twin?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
*You see I (Shelby) was going to be a twin, but my twin died before we he was born. Alli did not know the name of the twin, or if it was a boy or girl. But I did.
<br><br>
Shelby: Were you going to be my twin?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
* When we read this, Alli and I were in tears.<br>
<br>
Us: What was your name going to be?<br>
Board: Parker<br>
<br>
* I couldnt believe it, it was right. We were in shock and disbelief.<br>
<br>
Board randomly said: I love you.<br>
Shelby: I love you too.<br>
<br>
Shelby: Are you my guardian angel?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
* It was the most shocking experience ever. I'm really glad I got to talk to my brother, it was my biggest dream/wish. Now when we talk on the ouija board, we always talk to Parker. I will never ever forget that day. I feel he is always with me.
