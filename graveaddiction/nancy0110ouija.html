On January 27, 2010 I received an e-mail from Nancy about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have a story I wanted to share. I've played with the ouija board a lot, and talked to mostly demons. I always wanted to know about the future, so we talked to this demon named Gokie.  He told me and a friend about our future, and other things going on at the present time, which has all been correct.  But besides that, the first time I played the ouija board was about 2 and a half months ago.
<br><br>
We played it during the day, and asked if any spirits were around.  It quickly moved to yes. Right when that happened I thought, &quot;Could this be my neighbor that died a week ago?&quot; We asked for his nickname, and it spelled out &quot;Lechuga.&quot;  We then asked for his wife's name, and spelled her name too. We asked for his age (which me and my friend didn't know about), and it spelled out 55.  Right after that, I asked my mom how old he was when he died and she said that he was 55. Anyways, we kept asking him questions, like how he died, and he said he was poisoned.  We asked by who, and he said his wife because she hated him, and he wanted us to kill her because he was infuriated. We told him we couldn't do that, so he quickly said goodbye.
<br><br>
Two months later, exactly, my mom comes to me and says, &quot;Guess who's engaged and really happy?&quot; I said, &quot;Who?&quot; She said &quot;Lechuga's wife's name,&quot; and I was in shock...they were together for over 20 or 30 years, and it had barely been 2 months since his death. Suspicious, ain't it?
