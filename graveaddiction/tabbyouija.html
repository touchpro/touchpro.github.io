On September 11, 2007 I received an e-mail from Tabby N. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Thank you for taking the time to read my story.
<br><br>
The only people who know about this is my friend Tanya who shared the experience and my mom.  I wouldn't even bother sharing with people because it sounds so far fetched.
<br><br>
On night in December of 2005 I was at my girlfriend Tanya's house.  We were just fooling around with Tarot readings and soon got bored with that.  We decided to use a ouija board Tanya had since she was 12.  I had used a board probably 15 years before as a kid.  I believe we both have some special spiritual talent.
<br><br>
We got on the board, just asking any spirts who wanted to talk to come forward.  We talked to a few diffent spirits and that was all good.  All of a sudden the board was starting to spell out my last name, but the strange thing was the spirt was putting the letter N in between each letter of my last name.  I asked the board why my last name, who is this.  The board replied it was my father.
<br><br>
It gets even crazier, because even before using the board I never even thought of my dad (who had been passed away for 10 years at the time).  I never even thought of contacting him.
<br><br>
I began to cry.  It was as if my dad was right there with me, like he never even died at all.  My dad used to write letters to me as a kid and would always write at least 10 rows of XOXOXOXOXOX.  I'm pretty sure my dad was trying to reassure me it was him by continuing over those to letters.  I forgot he used to do that until he started going over XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX.  Also, in letters my dad would write VIP: very important person.  I had forgotten about that as well.
<br><br>
My girlfriend Tanya had no idea my dad used to do this when he was alive, she's never even meet the man.  It was just simply amazing.  My dad went on to reveal things about Tanya and was just right on the money about everything.  I asked about the 'N' being put into certain words, and basically it was a code to keep other spirits out so they would not be able to pretend that they were my dad.  I thought this was very clever.  At times my planchette would become very slow, and we thought it to be other spirits trying to get though.  My dad never let another spirit in, it was incredible.
<br><br>
This story doesn't end - near the end of the session, my dad had told us he was going to teach us a lesson for using the ouija board.
<br><br>
We didn't know at the time, but when we first got on the board somehow spirits were released into Tanya's house.  We both remember clearly while first in the board how there was this cold breeze that would go through both of our hands.  We brushed it off as if it was nothing.
<br><br>
To make a long story short, my dad was around for 3 days!  I didn't see my own house for the next 10 days because Tanya was too scared to be by herself.
<br><br>
We had some pretty amazing experiences over those 3 days.  I saw the spirit of my father, and Tanya saw him too.  I felt my dad as a spirit.  My dad started to fade out, you could tell his job was done and we were not surrounded by spirits anymore.  My dad taught me how to use my pendulum to contact him.  I've never picked up my pendulum since.
<br><br>
It was an amazing experience.  The ouija board now rests in my mom's basement.  We had to get it out of Tanya's house.  I have never touched a board since!  I'm really curious to do it again.  Just from that experience I would do it a lot differently next time.
