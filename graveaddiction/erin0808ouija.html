On August 15, 2008 I received an e-mail from Erin S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A friend (Jessica) and I (Erin) were sitting in my bedroom, where we have had a certain spirit talk to us. Her name is Emily, and she is 15. We have had trouble getting her to communicate with us. So we are going to try again.  Anything said, or moved, will be recorded.
<br><br>
Started: 8:38<br>
End: 10:00<br>
<br><br>
Erin: Is there a spirit here who wants to talk to us?  We have movement.<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Erin: What is your name?<br>
Spirit: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Erin: Could you please tell me what your name is?<br>
Spirit: Jen.<br>
<br>
Jessica: This is not the spirit we talked to before.<br>
<br>
Erin: How old are you Jen?<br>
Spirit: 16<br>
<br>
Erin: In what year did you die?<br>
Spirit: 1812<br>
<br>
Erin: Did you see the war that happened in 1812? (Talking to Jessica) In history, the War of 1812. Don't you remember?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
Jessica: No<br>
<br>
Erin: Yes to you were in the war?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Erin: What did you do to help out in the war?<br>
Spirit: Nurse<br>
<br>
Erin: How did you die?<br>
Spirit: Raid. (Somewhat confused, because it was between D and E)<br>
<br>
Erin: Did you spell out raid?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Erin: Did the raid happen at the nursing quarters you were serving at?<br>
Spirit: No.<br>
<br>
Erin: Where did this happen?<br>
Spirit: House.<br>
<br>
Erin: So this happened at your home?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Erin: Jessica, can you take over for a second?<br>
Jessica: Sure.<br>
<br>
Jessica: Hello<br>
Spirit: (Small movements)<br>
<br>
Erin: It stopped for like a second there.<br>
Spirit: (Movement) hi<br>
<br>
Jessica: Is this still Jen?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Jessica: Where is your home?<br>
Spirit: (Creaking coming from board) Resffsesf<br>
<br>
Erin: Jen, could you please give us and actual place?<br>
Spirit: Qcrerdpqc<br>
<br>
Jessica: Are you trying to spell an actual word or not?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Jessica: Are you a bad speller?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: Are you trying to spell something in another language?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Jessica: What language?<br>
Spirit: Fiviv<br>
<br>
Erin: I am going to ask you, could you please spell clearly?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Erin: Why won't you speak clearly for us?<br>
Spirit: Xhvil<br>
<br>
Erin: Do you have a problem with Jessica?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: Do you just have bad English skills?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: Please answer me so I can understand.<br>
Spirit: Xkwjvhug (Board was moving faster) twxfvrdqcpboan<br>
<br>
Jessica: What, are you 16 or 6?<br>
(This happened for a while, I have ceased recording because she would not stop)<br>
<br>
Jessica: Is this Jen?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: It's not Jen, and she's doing it again.<br>
(Multiple letters happened again)<br>
<br>
Jessica: Erin? Do you want to try this?<br>
<br>
Erin: Well, I guess I'm going to have to. I don't know what she's doing.<br>
(Jessica and Erin switched places)<br>
<br>
Erin: Jen, are you here?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Erin: Who was talking to Jessica before?<br>
Spirit: Sister.<br>
<br>
Erin: What's your little sister's name?<br>
Spirit: Jess.<br>
<br>
Jessica: That's f***ing creepy. Did she die in the same raid as you?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Erin: When did Jess die? Wow we have movement.<br>
Spirit: 1810<br>
<br>
Jessica: What did Jess die of?<br>
Spirit: Sick.<br>
<br>
Erin: What did she die of?<br>
Spirit: don't (Planchette went to no)<br>
<br>
Erin: Did you mean to say don't know?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: So you don't know the name of the sickness she died of?<br>
Spirit: Yes.<br>
<br>
Jessica: Were you with her when she died?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: Where were you?<br>
Spirit: home<br>
<br>
Erin: Where was your sister?<br>
Spirit: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Erin: Jen, would you mind telling me where you lived during the war?<br>
Spirit: Here<br>
<br>
Erin: So you lived in Green Bay?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: Was it called Green Bay at the time?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: What was it called?<br>
Spirit: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Erin: Jen, are you still here?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Jessica: Jen, what was it called when you lived here?<br>
Spirit: Bay<br>
<br>
Jessica: Is there any more to it?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Erin: Do you know where the war was held?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: How could you have been a nurse in the war if you didn't know where it was?<br>
Spirit: I was taken.<br>
<br>
Jessica: Blindfolded?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Jessica: Didn't anybody tell you?<br>
Spirit: No<br>

Spirit: Army<br>
<br>
Jessica: How old was your sister when she died?<br>
Spirit: 6<br>
<br>
Jessica: Why did she keep following the letters on the board? Would you know?<br>
Spirit: Illiterate<br>
<br>
Erin: Why did these men take you away?<br>
Spirit: Help<br>
<br>
Jessica: Help healing people?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: Why did they need to take you?<br>
Spirit: Mama wouldn't let them<br>
<br>
Jessica: Your mama?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: Why wouldn't she let you?<br>
Spirit: Death<br>
<br>
Erin: Was she afraid you would die?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: And they took you anyway?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>

<br>
Erin: Did you watch them kill her?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Erin: What did they do to her?<br>
Spirit: Shot her<br>
<br>

<br>

Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Erin: Did they let you go back home?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
