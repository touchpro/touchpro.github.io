On November 29, 2009 I received an e-mail from Allena D. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

An hour ago (its now 10:55 PM) I told my mom that I wasn't fully comfortable with a ouija board in my room. She tells me to take out the ouija board from my bookcase, but me being a fraidy cat, I was afraid to touch it. So she sighs and takes it from my bookcase. I follow my mom as she walks into her room, puts down the oujia board on the bed, and takes out her pendelum named Shaman. She asks him a couple of test questions, but he seemed a little out of it, so she used the other one. I don't think it has a name, but it passed the test questions and so on. Based on the answers given (which with pendelums, its yes or no) we concluded to use sage to cleanse the room, and after cleansing we burned sweetgrass to let the good spirits in and keep the bad ones out.
<br><br>
My mom was facing the board while I read it upside down as we were ready to communicate.  Here's pretty much what happened:
<br><br>
Me: We are not here to harm you, we are just curious as to who's here.<br>
Board: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Mom: Are you here with us?<br>
Board: (moves to yes)<br>
<br>
Me: Whoa, my hand has a weird warm spot.<br>
<br>
Mom: Are you moving it?<br>
<br>
Me: No, my hands are barely touching it. Lighten up a little though, it might help.<br>
<br>
Mom: (lightens fingers on planchette)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you willing to speak?<br>
Board: (still yes)<br>
<br>
Me: What is the first initial of your first name?<br>
Board: (moves to S)<br>
<br>
Mom: S...Sarah?<br>
Board:(no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: I think she's gone. Is there someone else here with us?<br>
Board: (moves to yes)<br>
<br>
Mom: Can you give us your name?<br>
Board: (moves to w then c)<br>
<br>
Me: WC?<br>
<br>
Mom: huh...<br>
<br>
Me: Can you give us your full name?<br>
Board: (moves to goodbye)<br>
<br>
Me: Must be a touchy subject.<br>
Mom: Probably.<br>
<br>
Me: One more?<br>
Mom: Oh, alright.<br>
<br>
Me: Who is here with us?<br>
Board: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Mom: We're not here to harm you.<br>
Board: (board moves to yes)<br>
<br>
Me: Can we ask you your name?<br>
Board: (planchette spells out S-I-N *pauses)<br>
<br>
Mom and I looked at each other.<br>
<br>
Board: (spells I-C)<br>
<br>
Mom: Sinic?<br>
<br>
Me: Sin I see?<br>
<br>
Mom: Do you want us to stop?<br>
Board: (moves to yes)<br>
<br>
Mom: Alright, goodbye then.
<br><br>
After that, I jumped on here and found that sinic means &quot;the chinese&quot; or china. I was wondering if it could possibly be his or her race, or maybe some war hero. Either way, my first experience was awesome.
