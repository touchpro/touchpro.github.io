On January 3, 2006 I received an e-mail from Megan about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Conner, Tim, and myself were watching televison. I went into my bedroom to get a candy cane, and when I opened the closet door I saw the Ouija board sitting on the ground.  So I offered to play it with them.  We went into my bedroom, closed the door, and turned out the light. I had recently owned a dog who died at age 15 by getting run over. We wanted to see if she would answer our question. Tim and I went first, and Conner sat and watched to see if we were moving the planchette. We asked it if Cali (our dog) still roams the earth. We had to wait a little while before it started to move. When it did start to move, it slowly moved to yes! After that we were a little freaked out.
<br><br>
Then it was Conner's turn to do it while Tim watched. Well, Conner had a great grandmother that he called Nannan. We carefully put our hands on the planchette and asked a question. He asked if his great grandmother was in Heaven. It took a little while, but it ended up moving.  Again it slowly moved to yes. Then Conner felt a cold hand rest on his shoulder. He started to scream and we all ran out of the room. Right now the Ouija board is still sitting in my room because none of us will go in my room to put it away!
