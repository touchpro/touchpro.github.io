On May 10, 2004 my friend Kate and I decided to use the 1920's Ouija board at my apartment.  Mark, another friend of ours, was coming over to watch <i>Family Plots</i> with us.  Mark is terrified of ouija boards, so we didn't have too much time to ask questions...we did get some interesting info though!

Beth: Is there anyone here in the room with us tonight?<br>
Board: <i>no movement</i>
