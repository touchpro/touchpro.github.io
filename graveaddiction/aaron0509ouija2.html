On May 27, 2009 I received an e-mail from an Aaron about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is just about my mum's ouija board experience. Years ago, a few years before I was born, my mum, her friend, and my auntie decided to do a ouija board because they had some questions to ask about. My mum wanted to ask about my uncle Tommy who went missing at sea, which i told you about in the <a href="aaron0509ouija.html">previous story</a>. My mum's friend wanted to ask about her grandad who had just passed away from cancer.  My auntie wanted to ask about the unborn baby that she recently miscarried, so they made a board out of paper and started asking it questions, sensible questions, to start with.  After awhile it still was not working, and my auntie started to not take it seriously. She started asking it if it was gay, and if it ever had a gangbang with Freddie Mercury and Eric Clapton.  They were all laughing, and then the glass they were using started to spin violently.  Then my auntie asked it if anyone was there, and the board spelled out &quot;6-6-6.&quot; Then my auntie asked if the devil, Satan, was there, and it went to &quot;yes.&quot; Then the glass shattered right in front of them, by itself with no interference.  There was a strong smell of candle wax, so they called the shots that night as they got really freaked out.  My mum said that whereever she went, she always felt as if she was being followed. &quot;I didn't believe that it was gonna work,&quot; she said, &quot;but it obviously did.  Its so fascinating, but dangerous.  So take care when doing the ouija board.&quot;
