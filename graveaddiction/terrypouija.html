On March 7, 2007 I received an e-mail from Terry P. about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Terry, and this was not my first time using a ouija board, but it was the most interesting. Before I tell you what happened, first you need a little background information. We were at my friend Tanya's house. We being: my cousin Gary, my friend Colton, Tanya, and me. The interesting thing about Tanya: she is haunted by demons. Real demons, believe it or not. The other interesting thing about that is after she told us about them is that they started haunting us too. The demons seem to reside in Tanya's room, so we decided to ouija there. (Note: I have reprinted the answers as they were spelled out by the board)
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a demon?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What are you?<br>
Board: Captured feer<br>
<br>
Me: How many of you are there?<br>
Board: 3<br>
<br>
Me: How many types of supernatural creatures are on the property? (Tanya's parents own about 7 acres)<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
Me: Are the demons stalking us called Alastors? (After doing some research on demonology, they seemed to be the most likely culprit)<br>
Board: To some<br>
<br>
Me: What are the imp-like things that are also following us?<br>
Board: Lester (Gary and I had an uncle named Lester who died several years ago)<br>
<br>
Me: What are the other beings that are out there on the property (We already knew that Tanya's uncle Jim's ghost was sticking around the place, probably battling the demons)<br>
Board: Balehounds<br>
<br>
Me: Did {name of a particular person who needs to be shot} curse something of Tanya's?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What did he curse?<br>
Board: Neklace<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Tanya had roughly forty necklaces.<br>
<br>
Me: Which necklace?<br>
Board: Half<br><br>
We figured that it was one of her friendship necklaces, of which she only had ten or so. We decided to get all of them, place them one by one on the board and ask if that was the necklace in question, on the second or third attempt we got a yes.
<br><br>
Me: Are any of us in particular danger?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who?<br>
Board: Penis<br>
<br>
Me: Colton, please for the love of god, tell me that was you! (it seemed to me like the sort of immature prank he would pull)<br>
Colton: I didn't do it<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye<br>
Board: Goodbye
