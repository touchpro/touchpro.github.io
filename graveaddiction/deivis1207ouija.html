On November 26, 2007 I received an e-mail from Deivis about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me (Deivis), my friend Jesse, and my cousin Richard one night decided that we were going to play the ouija board we had bought recently. At that time, Richard and I had a Ouija board experience where Jesse did not.
<br><br>
The week before we talked to someone named &quot;Huap.&quot; He told us he was an bad spirit, but he was pretty funny and pretty cool (Keep in mind that I have researched Ouija boards throughly and know when a spirit is a dangerous one). Well we got it out and started getting warmed up.
<br><br>
We started asking:
<br><br>
Us: Is there anyone here that would like to speak to us?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: What's your name?<br>
Board: Kimi (Or Kisi, something like that)<br>
<br>
Us: How old are you?<br>
Board: 12<br>
<br>
Us: Do you live here?<br>
Board: M-Y-O-U-R-E-D-O-N-E<br>
<br>
Us: Huh? Whats that?<br>
Board: Y-O-U-R-E-D-O-N-E<br>
<br>
Richard: It said &quot;You are done&quot;<br>
Me: So how am I done?<br>
Board: B-L-O-O-D<br>
<br>
(I should've stopped playing here, but I decided that I wanted to check him out)<br>
<br>
Me: Whats your name?<br>
Board: J-E-S-S-E<br>
<br>
(Here my friend Jesse started getting scared, thinking the board was talking about him)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you talking about Jesse or is your name Jesse?<br>
Board: A-B-O-U-T<br>
<br>
Me: So you're talking about Jesse?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Your name is Jesse?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: So who is done?<br>
Board: R-I-C-H-A-R-D<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Board: B-L-O-O-D<br>
<br>
Us: We knew that (lol)<br>
<br>
(By this time I guessed the spirit was not a demon because of one thing. His name.)<br>
<br>
Board: I-A-M-G-O-I-N-G-T-O-K-I-L-L-J-E-S-S-E<br>
<br>
(Jesse started panicking and stopped playing...he hasn't played since)<br>
<br>
Us (Richard and I): (lol) thats pretty cool<br>
Board: N-O-M-O-M-O-M-O-M-O<br>
<br>
Us: Huh?<br>
Board: N-O-M-O-M-O-M-O-M-O<br>
<br>
Us: We don't know what that means.<br>
Board: (moving really fast) D-E-I-V-I-S-N-O-M-O-M-O-M-O<br>
<br>
Richard: Dude, its that guy we talked to last week.<br>
Me: Is this Huap?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
After this I asked him how he was doing and such...but as usual he puts up gibberish to mess with us lol.
<br><br>
A bit ago we spoke to Jesse again. He's still around, and I found out that him, Huap, and some other spirit that lives in my house like to ride in the car with me. lol Jesse as I guessed is not a bad spirit, nor are any of the 6 that live in my house (as far as I know). Still, even today, I will not play the board alone. Also, before we spoke to Jesse, we kept talking to someone who would constantly slide the planchette through &quot;goodbye.&quot; I didn't even ask if there were spirits there - the planchette would just slide through goodbye. If anyone knows a reason why this might happen (other than they didn't want to talk to me) please let me know.
