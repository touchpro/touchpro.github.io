On January 5, 2005 I received an e-mail from an anonymous site visitor about her ouija board experience.  I don't agree with her thoughts regarding ouija boards (I think they are perfectly safe), but I will post the story anyway:
<br><br><br>
&quot;The Ouija Board is dangerous; it is called the most dangerous game and it is very true.  A long time ago I was introduced to this by a boss of mine who thought she was a psychic and also believed in a lot of things I wouldn't normally think twice about. Anyway she got me interested in it and gave me the story about white and black magic, and this was definitely white magic because it will cause no harm. 
<br><br>
Well I bought my very own Ouija Board and it told me several things that were surprising and true that nobody else could have known. But what the board does is act like a homing device for all spirits roaming about the world...the spirits that walk the world are not exactly good.  Anyway, I began to hear noises as soon as I went to bed but never when I was in the room with them. Many, many things took place over a long period of time but I never paid much attention to them. 
<br><br>
One story I can tell is - the night before my son was to be married he was sitting in the living room.  The door to my bedroom was closed and I heard something hit the door once, then another time, and finally I came out and said &quot;Don't you know that I am trying to fall asleep? Why are you throwing things at the door to keep me awake?&quot;  My son answered that he thought I was throwing things at the door because I was angry that he may have been making too much noise and wanted it to be quiet.  As you can see, something was trying to cause an argument between my son and myself. 
<br><br>
There is a lot more that I can say about the board (that a long time ago went into the trash).  I even had my house blessed, don't think that nothing can happen.  Do not publicize my email address, I am just writing this for people who think it is harmless because it always starts out that way.  But gradually people get into Tarot cards too which are even worse.&quot;
