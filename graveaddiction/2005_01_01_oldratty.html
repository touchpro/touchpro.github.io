		<div class="content">A week later and here I am.  So much easier to blog when mommy has class.  The nosy bitch looks over my shoulders and makes me nervous and it is already hard enough to type with my little tiny paws. <br />Let's talk about mommy.  She does terrible things to me.  She has started letting those mangy dogs on the bed that she and I share (only because I am a nice cat do I even let her sleep in my bed and now she is taking liberties by inviting others in!), she had the nerve to BRUSH ME and she even held me down forcibly to do it.  She has called me FAT a few times and is limiting the number of POUNCE and 'Yums she gives me.  But worse of all is that mommy STINKS, big old capital letters, STINKS!!!!!  She goes to the Humane Society on Saturdays and Sundays and comes home smelly as a cesspool.  She smells like puppies, she smells like all kinds and sizes of dogs, she smells like dog poop, she has dog hair on her and worst of all, she smells of other cats, has their hair on her and even smells like other cat poop.  I mean if she wants to smell bad she is welcome to roll around in my litter box.  Then the do-gooder tries to tell me she is busy helping poor animals that don't have homes or a family of their own that loves them.  That is totally beyond my comprehension.  After all, all animals are superior to humans, humans are at our beck and call,  they worship and adore us.  I just cannot imagine their are any animals out there that are not loved or cared for.  Even worse, mommy was saying that once she gets some more hours in she might even get to go out on abuse and neglect calls with the humane officier.  Beyond my comprehension, how could any human do that to an animal of any kind.  If mommy is telling me the truth then the human race is in worse shape than I originally imagined.  I have been watching TV too.  Something about a Tsunami hitting some islands and people being killed but worse, children being subjected to abuse and even being sold.  Humankind needs a serious overhaul, geez, even these stunted, elongated rodent dogs that I am forced to live with have better morales than some humans and we are talking about dogs that eat shit if they can find it.<br /><br />Little pissed off tonight, we get a warmer than normal evening in January without rain and those shortlegged clowns of the dog world get to trek up to the barn and even over to the park!  Where I am you might ask, stuck in the damned house because mommy had class and mommy's mommy forgot about me.  Well, actually I think I ran from her and she told me to stay in the house and not yowl about it later.  Hahahahahaaaaaa, fat cow, I will yowl at her all night.  I may even decide to sing a song outside her bedroom door around 2 in the morning since she has to go to work tomorrow nice and early.<br /><br />Yes, I have learned a new trick.  Mommy sleeps like the dead once she gets to sleep and she swears she has never heard me but mommy's m0mmy and daddy have heard me loud and clear in the middle of the night.  I have learned to sing.  The melody varies but I usually start in the living room where the piano is and tune up with a few good yowls.  Then I start trilling and add in a few louds purrs and start walking up and down the hallway, pausing outside bedroom doors to be sure they get to hear me in all my glory.  If no one wakes up I have been known to go in and loudly purr or yowl in peoples' ears.  Ahhhh, I cannot tell you how much joy their swearing brings to my heart.  Even better, once they awaken many times they cannot fully go back to sleep so have a miserable day the next day.  It is so good to be a superior being, to be a CAT.<br /><br />I wanted to talk a little about the big holiday, you know Christmas, the season of love, peace, joy and lots of swearing at this house.  First, mommy's daddy doesn't shop.  Mommy's daddy doesn't really have a clue when it comes to gift giving or being romantic or hell, even being thoughtful, so mommy and Beth the Brutal think of the gifts and buy them and wrap them and tell daddy what the gifts are and he gives them the money.  Well, no, not really, he tells Beth the Brutal and mommy to go to mommy's mommy and ask for money.  He really is bad at this whole gift giving thing.  Then the next big thing, mommy's mommy is old and fat and very tired.  She thought she could pay the bills, keep the house clean, the laundry done, meals cooked, all the normal household stuff done and decorate the tree and do all the baking and candy making.  Things went pretty good, a little stressful but not too bad until the peanut brittle escapade.  Mommy's daddy loved the peanut brittle (was excellent) and he ate a lot, like a whole batch.  So mommy's mommy had to make more but she bought the wrong kind of nuts, thought gee what could it hurt and well it hurt a lot. Tasted downright nasty.  Mommy's mommy was tired that night, that went wrong and she just lost it.  She cried, said she quit, to hell with @#%^*&_%$#@&amp;^ Christmas, to hell with family, let her the hell alone, she went in, turned on her pc, shut the door and did not come out until everyone went to bed.  She had it, she was major upset, she scared me.  Mommy felt bad so she took some time off work to help out and even mommy's daddy who is definitely not the most helpful or motivated person around the house got off his ass and did some things.  Mommy's mommy thanked them (but secretly that pisses her off that she has to thank them when no one thanks her for washing dishes, cooking, laundry, cleaning the shitty toilet bowl (thank God for my litter box), etc.) when everyone lives here and should be pitching in to do an equal share.  Anyway, lo and behold, just when you think the holiday will get here and no blood will be shed we get an ice storm.  People all over were losing power and some did not get it for more than 10 days!!!  We were lucky, we kept power meaning I stayed warm and happy and we had light but we had no cable.  More about the cable later.  It is Christmas Eve around 2-3 p.m. and the phone rings and it is mommy's mommy's sister-in-law who usually hosts the Christmas night family gathering.  Seems they had not had power nor were they likely to get power, she had already called mommy's mommy's sister who could not host and mommy's mommy's other sister in law wasn't sure so the first sister-in-law was just cancelling.  You know what happened next, mommy's mommy said, "no problem, we will have it here tomorrow night around 5:30 and anyone who can come just come on over."  She immediately got off the phone after saying goodbye to one real relieved sister-in-law and called Beth the Brutal with a grocery list since Beth is within walking distance of a really big supermarket and could bring down some celery, carrots, a couple kinds of dips, a couple kinds of chips and a shrimp ring.  Got to tell you more later about the shrimp ring (yes, my eyes are rolling).  Anyway, mommy's mommy raided the freezer, fixed a couple big beef roasts and made some shredded chicken for sandwiches and she was ready to go.  The spread was pretty amazing for a 24 hour notice but funnier still was who all came.  Everyone, even the sister that went white trash on the family decided to bring her whole clan along.  Of course mommy's mommy and the rest of the family was gracious but it certainly was a wild and wooly evening.  Oh yeah, and some of the nieces and nephews are breeding so there were little people here, 3 of them.  Quite the adventure but more about this later too.  I watched Christmas Vacation this year and honestly, it was just a little to close to home for me to find it amusing.<br />Still, it is late and I must go.  Time to curl on my pillow by the fire and feel superior to everyone else in the house.<br />Enjoy your week, I will be back!<br /></div><br>

		<div class="content">Bet everyone thought I had gone to that big scratching post in the sky.  It has been June since I blogged last.  Hey, it is not easy being supreme ruler of the world as I know it.  Takes lots of energy and I do have my butt to lick you know!<br />What has happened since June in my little world?  Just way too much and not all of it was good at the time but has proven to be for the best.<br />Typical summer stuff, Beth the Brutal traveled and explored and documented her adventures on her website graveaddiction.com.  Beth is unique, not too many people like cemeteries like she does.  Still, she found time to visit and bother me and yes, also try to make up by giving me many Pounce treats.<br />Mommy found me a new treat, Aquari-yums.  Even better than Pounces and if you give me enough I will puke on the floor for everyone's viewing pleasure.  Never fear, those heathen, depraved creatures, the hunds from hell, eat my puke as fast as I can manufacture and spew it.  Bet that is more than most of you wanted to know.<br />There were summer parties, mommy's Uncle Bob and Aunt Cecelia had a very nice 4th of July party complete with City BBQ and Mommy and her mommy and Daddy as well as Beth the Brutal and Mike attended.  More about Mike later, but let me tell you for sure, he is at the top of my litter box list.  Never did like him but tolerated him for mommy's sake...but again, more on that later.<br />There was a party at the barn for just the family and it was a whole lot of fun.  Mommy's mommy of course fixed way too much and everyone brought really good stuff too so a good time was had by all.  A few of those recipes will eventually find their way into the second family cookbook if Mommy's mommy ever gets off her ass and gets started!!!!  She finds more excuses for delay.  You would think she works hard or something.<br />A major event happened this late summer, like September 11th.  Ok, first understand that while the family is Red, White and Blue as are the neighbors involved, the fact that they were planning a party on 9-11 did not even occur to them as a bad date.  Even after someone was bold enough to point out that there was a terrible happening 9-11-2001, Mommy's mommy said too late, the pig was picked out, the slaughter date set and she would attone by decorating with Red, White and Blue.  The date for this event was also bad because it was the first Ohio State football game of the year.  Mommy's mom and her neighbor Jim pretty much said, "Who really gives a shit, watch the game or miss the party" and continued as planned.  Have I mentioned that this was a Hog Roast, you know, roasting a whole hog, inviting lots of people and eating like, well, hogs?  First time ever and it was a success!!!  Definitely a go again in September 2005.  Will be better since mommy's mom and neighbor Jim have one under their belt.  By the way, no one thought to let me taste the hog, sure they ate and drank and had a great time but I sat in the house (even those butt-smelling elongated dogs got to go to the party on the hill) and watched out the window.  I was quick to yowl long and loudly and let them know I did not like being excluded.  Mommy did not get much sleep!<br />During all of the summer fun, flowers blooming, great garden (first in a long time that produced more than weeds), grass cutting, and fleamarketing (not me dumbasses, I do not get fleas and am never in the market for fleas, mommy's mommy is always looking for fleas though which seems silly to me), and all the other fun summer stuff, some bad things were happening.  Mommy and her friend Mike were fighting lots.  He broke it off in August but they were back together in time for the Hog Roast (by the way, Beth the Brutual made the coolest invitations for that).  Still things were not going great, but everyone else was pretending not to see and hoping for the best but everyone had their own idea of what was best for mommy.  Me included!  Even the wiener dogs had opinions though theirs do not count for much since they have pea sized brains.  The Farm Equipement Demolition Derby (Combine Demolition Derby at the Fairfield County Fair in Lancaster Ohio) came and went and everyone went and seemed to have fun, a fall trip to Roscoe Village (near Coshoction OH) was fun, and then finally it was time for planning the annual Halloween party.  Mike and mommy would go on Saturdays and pick apples (too goddamned many apples, what the hell am I supposed to do with these was heard spoken loudly and often by mommy's mom) and one Saturday mommmy's mommy went with them and bought PUMPKINS!  White ones, green one (really a squash), and red bumpy thing (some variety of Hubbard squash), not to mention the normal old orange pumpkins.  These were all carved for the Halloween event and after mommy even took a couple up to Mike's house (unappreciative turd) so his dad's house could be decorated for Halloween.  But anyway, the day of the Halloween party really sucked, it rained and rained but it was a go anyway and enough people came and the food was good and everyone was happy and in the spirit of the holiday.  Mommy's mom threatened to drink lots and dance naked around the bonfire and do other nasty things but the rain kept the bonfire from taking off so we were all saved.  Now visualizing her doing that is the scariest thing ever!!! <br />Then it happened, right before Beggar's Night, Mike dumped Mommy.  Yes, he dumped her, on email even (no balls in mommy's mommy's opinion)!  But that is ok, mommy cried lots, cried more when she heard he was talking about her and saying horrible things (mommy's mommy really had an opinion on that! but even I cannot use the "F" word as creatively as she was doing during that tirade) but somewhere in there I think I understand her to say immature, cheap, no conscience, no sense of loyalty, stuff like that.  I do know this, I would not want anyone to dislike me as much as mommy's mommy family dislikes him.  Mommy's mommy says it is not even the breakup, she never felt they were a match, his family values are totally different from ours, more materialistic and more concerned with keeping up with everyone than just relaxing and enjoying life so she knew it would never work and it was just a matter of time and was acutally surprised it took so long.  She is just angry at the way he acted after.  Her only hope is karma comes swiftly and someday he will experience that same pain.  Mommy's mommy would not wish bad on him because she doesn't want bad karma.  Beth the Brutal isn't as worried about karma (think about it, she loves graveyards!) and she doesn't hesitate to say what she thinks although her language is better than mommy's mommy.  Mommy for her part just says she doesn't understand and has gone through a period of self-doubt and no self esteem.  However, people have been inviting her places and talking more to her and they say they like her better now.  I think mommy tried so hard to be what he wanted her to be (which changed everyday) that she couldn't be mommy.  I like her better and yes, even the 3 long-haired mutants that I live with, notice a diffence and like her better.  She has some possible big events planned for the summer, so mommy will be ok.  Everyone says she seems to be a nicer person and that she smiles more and seems happier.  She has even lost weight, which wasn't necessary but only made her better.  Enough though, that is all over and done and while it was painful it turned out for the best for everyone involved. <br />Breaking news, last week the "boys" had to go to the vet for shots and checkups and nail trims.  Sammy and Oscar needed a tooth cleaning which happened today.  They could not eat since 10:00 P.M. last night.  No water either, heheheheeeeeee.  But enough of my glee, when mommy's mommy and daddy went to get them, OH NO, Sammie had to have 2 teeth pulled.  Right now mommy's mommy is fixing them rice cooked in chicken broth with a few diced carrots.  The vet said nothing until 10:00 P.M. tonight but these are some hungry hunds and they aren't walking really good, heheheheheeeeee, kinda like drunk wieners.  The aftereffects of anesthesia, heheheheeeeee.  Mommy's mommy remembered back to when mommy and Beth the Brutal were babies and this is what the pediatrician said to feed them when they were really sick with the flu so mommy's mommy decided dogs could eat it too.  So far so good, no puke anywhere.<br /><br />So much more to tell but duty calls, or is it the litter box?  Regardless, I must go.  I promise to try to blog more faithfully.  After all, I never even got to the Christmas festivities, or should I say fiasco?<br /><br />Farewell for now lesser beings, Ratty the Ruler has returned.<br /></div><br>
