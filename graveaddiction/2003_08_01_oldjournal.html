I managed to survive the first day back at work after my two day absence.  It actually wasn't too bad, which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I updated the main portion of the site tonight - <a href="newstuff.html">click HERE</a> to see a list of the four new pages.  There is a new ouija story, photos from the Moonville Tunnel, photos from the Moonville Cemetery, and photos from the Hope Furnace.  Three three new pages of photos are all from haunted places!!<br /><br />It just finished raining again.  This storm wasn't near as bad as this morning's long 2+ hour storm, I didn't see any lightning and it only lasted for about 10-15 minutes.  However, the rain must have really made the humidity worse, because now all of my windows are fogged up.  At least I won't have to water the outside plants tonight!<br /><br />I found out that my friend Chrissie, the one who just had the bariatric surgery (stomach stapling), is having some really big surgery complications.  I had a voicemail from another friend I went to high school with at 10:30PM Sunday night.  Jennifer, the friend, said that Chrissie called her and told her that she was back in the hospital because she was having trouble breathing and was experiencing really bad pain.  The doctors told her it was a bruised muscle, but let her stay overnight.  It's a good thing they let her stay....yesterday morning she blacked out in the bathroom and hit her head.  She had to have 10 stitches.  Her blackout prompted the doctors to run more tests, and it turns out she has blood clots in her lungs!!!  That's a pretty serious complication.  Now she's on blood thinners and pain medication, plus she's in the hospital for a couple more days.  Makes me wonder how being skinny can be so important to some people (that was her goal, she had no medical reason to have the surgery).  I know one thing...I'll never have that surgery, the possible side effects and complications are just too risky in my opinion!  I hope Chrissie feels better soon!  Not only do I worry about her health, but she's supposed to start grad school soon and that's so important to her.  <br /><br />Well, that's about it for tonight.  It's only 8PM and I'm going to sign off the internet for the night...it's been a LONG time since I've spent so little time online!! :)<br><br>

I found <a href="http://www.pressanykey.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/pak/names.cgi" target="_blank">the link</a> for this in  <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/blogtronics/" target="_blank"> Erik's</a> blog...I looked up Beth and Elizabeth:<br /><br />The name of Beth brings opportunities for success in business and financial accumulation. It fires you with ambition and promotional ideas, ideas that are original, progressive, and large-scale. With this name, success to you is a foregone conclusion, for you cannot conceive any reason for not reaching all your goals, as you have self-sufficiency, supreme confidence, boundless energy, and enthusiasm. As long as you have a sense of freedom from monotony and drudgery, and can see progress being made, you feel buoyant and optimistic. However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression. The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection. Others see you as rather shrewd and calculating. Your intense, restless nature can bring on tension which affects the solar plexus and digestion, or the female organs.  <br /><br />Your name of Elizabeth gives you a very idealistic but passive outlook on life. You desire culture and all the refinements of life but you are inclined to live in your dreams. Although you would like to do many things, procrastination undermines your accomplishment and success in life. You do not like to create issues and will do anything to avoid a conflict. Making decisions is difficult for you without the support and approval of others. This name gives you a very sensitive nature, making you feel much that you do not understand. Your feelings are easily hurt, at which times you are inclined to withdraw and become uncommunicative. Although you desire the friendship and association of others, you find it difficult to express your thoughts through the spoken word, and others find you hard to get to know. It is much more natural for you to express your deeper thoughts in writing. Inner tension can deplete your physical vitality. You are inclined to indulge in rich foods that lack proper nourishment. The physical weaknesses due to this name centre in the heart and respiratory organs, and in the fluid functions. <br><br>

Where have I been?  I've been SICK!  I'm feeling much better today though.  I started feeling a little sick on the way home from the Moonville Tunnel early (<i>very</i> early!) Monday morning.  When I woke up at 5:30 Monday morning to get ready for work I felt even worse.  So I ended up calling in sick on Monday and Tuesday.  <br /><br />I think I should have called in sick again today.  I think the terrible storm we had was a sign for me to stay home...but I ignored it.  My twenty minute drive turned into a 40 minute drive, the storm was terrible!  Really hard rain, loud thunder, and lots of lightning.  You know a storm is bad when people are driving 25-35mph on I-270!  If I had been sitting at home I would have taken some digital photos of the lightning...it was the really streaky kind that lasted for a long time.  I swear, my drive to work was like driving with strobe lights, the lightning kept flashing.  I love storms, I just don't like driving in them!<br /><br />My trip to the Moonville Tunnel was a lot of fun!  There were just four of us, counting myself.  We left Columbus around 4:30 and made it to the Lake Hope Furnace around 5:45.  It was probably another 15 minutes or so before we made it to the gravel road near the tunnel.  We parked the cars and then walked to the cemetery.  It was a very small cemetery, but it was really cool since it was in such a desolate, isolated location.  Then we walked along Racoon Creek to the tunnel.  Vinton County is basically just a big forest, so the woods we walked through was very dense.  When we came to a hill, Chris told me that the tunnel was up at the top, but the trees and weeds were so thick that I couldn't even see it!  We stayed at the tunnel until about 10:30-11:00PM.  It was pitch black back there, I could barely see the people sitting right next to me!  We didn't hear or see any ghosts, but we did hear all sorts of wildlife, including an owl.  We stopped at Steak 'n Shake to eat on the way back, and I finally made it home at 2:22AM.  It really was fun, I'll try to post the pictures on the site tonight!<br /><br />And finally, here are my results to a couple of cool quizzes I found in <a href="http://bethiwethie.blogspot.com" target="blank">Beth's</a> blog: <br /><br /><table width="300" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width="180"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Disorder</b></font></td><td width="120"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Rating</b></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#paranoid">Paranoid</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#schizoid">Schizoid</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#schizotypal">Schizotypal</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#990099" face="arial" size="-1">Moderate</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#antisocial">Antisocial</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#borderline">Borderline</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#histrionic">Histrionic</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#narcissistic">Narcissistic</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#avoidant">Avoidant</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#990099" face="arial" size="-1">Moderate</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#dependent">Dependent</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#000099" face="arial" size="-1">Low</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/disorder_information2.html#obsessive">Obsessive-Compulsive</a>:</font></td><td><font color="#ff0000" face="arial" size="-1">High</font></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="-1"><br>-- <a href="http://www.4degreez.com/misc/personality_disorder_test.mv" target="_blank">Personality Disorder Test - Take It!</a> --</font></td></tr></table><br><br /><br /><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="300" ALIGN="CENTER"><TR><TD><br /><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="2"><br /><B>Are you Addicted to the Internet?</B><BR><br /><TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#666666" CELLPADDING="1" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD VALIGN="CENTER" ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="15"><TR><TD WIDTH="192" BGCOLOR="#00CC00" VALIGN="MIDDLE" ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000000"><B>64%</B></FONT> </TD><TD WIDTH="108" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br /><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><br /><B>Hardcore Junkie</B> <FONT COLOR="#00CC00" SIZE="2">(61% - 80%)</FONT><BR>While you do get a bit of sleep every night and sometimes leave the house, you spend as much time as you can online.

My day at work was much better than yesterday.  Sure, I'm still a little angry about having to do the presentation on Tuesday, but I vented about it to my manager so I feel better.  I found out there are even more obstacles with the automated testing stuff, which would usually frustrate me...however, I'm to the point that I find the whole situation amusing.  I filled Shawn in on everything that I found out today, since he's working on this automation effort with me.  We ended up discussing all sorts of &quot;issues&quot; we have about some of the things that go on.  It was fun!<br /><br />Today was the &quot;I Got Caught&quot; luncheon.  We have this recognition program at Nationwide called &quot;I Got Caught&quot;.  If a coworker &quot;catches&quot; you going over and above they can have your manager nominate you for one of these awards.  Managers can also nominate their employees.  Then eveyone who was &quot;caught&quot; in all of Nationwide Financial gets to go to a lunch (or breakfast - whatever upper management decides).  They do this quarterly.  The past two quarters they've had breakfast for all of us in the Dublin area, this was the first lunch.  It was really good, they had it at the Dublin Rec Center, and it was catered by City Barbeque.  Even more exciting than the excellent food was being away from the office for an hour and a half :)<br /><br />Tonight I've been making food for tomorrow's night ouija party.  I made brownies and rice krispie treats (with LOTS of marshmallows!).  I also made taco dip....mmmmmmm, I love taco dip, it was hard to resist opening the chips and eating some now :)  I'm so glad Tracy gave me the recipe back when I worked on Project Focus.  Some of you probably use the same recipe, but for those of you who have never made this....it's just cream cheese and picante sauce mixed together until it's a spreadable consistency.  Then you put shredded cheese on top.  I personally think it looks pretty gross, it's a salmon color.  But it tastes sooooooo good!  I made two pie pans full, and I know several of the people there just love it so I bet we end up eating most of it!<br><br>

I think today was one of the worst days I've had for a long time at work.  Well, at least the worst one I've had in a week or so :)  It was just frustrating.  Not only did I have to be &quot;negative&quot; (I was really being realistic, but I'm sure the people who are higher than me and don't actually work on the assignments would probably say negative) in an automated testing meeting, but I also found out that I have to do a little presentation about automated testing at the department meeting this coming Tuesday.  I'm never thrilled about having to speak in front of a large group of people.  This is even worse...I'm going to be speaking in front of a large group of people who honestly don't care about the stuff I'm presenting.  I'm all stressed out about it, this sucks!!!  And I'm so glad they gave me so much advance notice (said with total sarcasm).  I can also hear someone saying &quot;but doing the presentation shouldn't bother you, you had no problems doing presentations about frogs and ghosts for large groups...&quot;  Yes, that is a true statement.  However, I like talking about frogs and ghosts much better than talking about automated testing tools, plus I was talking to a group of kids who were excited about meeting a webmaster rather than a group of bored coworkers.  One of the reasons I like being a tester is that you pretty much write test plans, execute test plans, do the occasional training for teammates, and go to meetings.  This is the first time I've had to speak at a meeting like this.  I'll get over it, but right now I'm just a tad bit angry.<br /> <br />Ah, only the rest of this week and all of next week to go...then I'm on vacation for a week!!!!!  I really need the time away from the office.   It will give me a chance to take more pictures for the site too :)  <br /><br />I'm also really excited about this week's ouija party.  Just about everyone I invited is planning to come, hopefully the board will &quot;tell&quot; us some interesting things!  As always, I'll be typing up the transcripts and putting them on the <a href="ouija.html">ouija stories</a> page.<br /><br />Well, since I'm in such a foul mood about work I'm not going to write too much...I'm afraid my current mood might cast a negative light on everything I write. Hopefully tomorrow will be MUCH better!<br><br>

I'm not going to post a long entry since it seems like I've been online all night...I made some <a href="newstuff.html">updates</a> to the main part of my site.  One of those updates was breaking the 8+ minute recording from my trip to the <a href="osr.html">Ohio State Reformatory</a> into smaller, more dialup friendly mp3 files.  You can see the list of nine small mp3 files by <a href="osrevp.html">clicking here</a> and scrolling towards the bottom of the page.  The first two mp3's are my favorite!<br /><br />In addition to adding the new page to the main part of the site, I uploaded a few photos that I promised all of you...the Nerd Prom 2000 photos!!!  <a href="nerdprom.html">Click here</a> to see them!!!<br /><br />I promise that I'll blog more tomorrow...right now I'm going to sign off and go get some sleep!<br><br>

Today is my blog's 1 year anniversary!!<br /><br />I managed to get the photos from the OSR on the site last night, it actually took a lot longer than I thought it would.  I think the photos turned out pretty good, especially since it was pitch black in there and I couldn't really see the objects I was photographing until the flash lit everything up.  You can see the new OSR pages (I think there's 11 total, counting the main page) by <a href="osr.html">clicking here</a>.  In addition to the photos I also included some really big wav files.  The largest one is almost 5.5MB.  I plan to find some audio editing software that I can understand, then I'll break the files into smaller, more dialup friendly sizes.<br><br>

Exciting news!  My next big exploration is going to be August 24...I'm going to the Moonville Tunnel, Moonville Cemetery, and the Lake Hope Furnace with the <a href="http://www.shadowseekers.org" target="_blank">Shadowseekers</a>!!!    I've wanted to go to the Moonville Tunnel ever since I read about it last November.  The cemetery looks pretty cool too.  Moonville is one of Ohio's many ghost towns, it's in Vinton County.  All that's left are a couple house foundations in the woods, the cemetery, and the railroad tunnel.  The tunnel and cemetery are supposedly haunted, so we're going to do an investigation.  Some say the Lake Hope Furance is also haunted.  Depending on how late it is, we're also going to stop by Beck's Knob road in Lancaster...supposedly the ghost of a hermit is seen along one of the curves on this road.  August 24 suddenly seems so far away, even thought it's less than two weeks!<br /><br />Last night I went to dinner with Chrissie, Susan, and their coworker Wes.  It was Chrissie's last supper before she has bariatric surgery tomorrow.  So really it's basically the last real meal she'll have for the rest of her life.  I still think she's crazy for doing it, but I'm not going to elaborate any more on my thoughts regarding her surgery.  Anyway, we went to the Bombay Grille in Dublin.  It's an authentic Indian restaurant, we all got something different and shared.  Everything was very good, but I was a little disappointed that the vindaloo lamb wasn't as spicy as I was anticipating.  Like Wes said, the hot sauce at Chipotle is a lot spicer.  Susan got this spinach stuff that was really good too, which surprised me since I'm not a big spinach fan.  Having dinner with Chrissie and her coworkers made me laugh - all three of them fit the stereotype for &quot;science geek&quot;!!! :)  I'm sure some of you probably think it's mean for me to call them geeks, but I'm allowed...they admit that they are, just like I admit that I'm a computer nerd!  <br /><br />Tonight I'm going to work really hard on getting the pictures from last Friday's ghost hunt on the site.  I went through 140 pictures last night, resized them, and picked out 114 of them to put on the site.  I still have 44 left to look through :)  Yes, it's going to be a BIG page.  I'm going to divide it into sections, just like I did for the <a href="jcp.html">Junction City Prison</a> and <a href="lakin.html">Lakin State Hospital</a>.  Oh, and speaking of Lakin...Jeremy sent me three photos he and his friends took there a couple weeks ago, so I'm planning to add those to the site as well.  Looks like it'll probably be next week before I get the Baltimore Museum, Evergreen Cemetery, East Lawn Cemetery, and Riverside pages done.  I'm going to be keeping VERY busy!<br /><br />Time to get back to work!  I doubt I'll get a chance to blog again tonight, but who knows?<br><br>

It's been awhile since I last posted...guess I don't have to tell you that I've been busy!!<br /><br />Linda and I had a fantastic time at the Ohio State Reformatory ghost hunt on Friday.  We were allowed to enter the prison at 8PM, and we didn't leave until 4:30AM the following morning.  I probably should have taken last Friday off work, then I could have slept in.  I woke up at 5:30AM Friday morning, and didn't get home until 5:45AM the next morning...which means I was awake for a little over 24 hours.  And I'm just too old to go that long without sleep :)  Even though I was exhausted by 3AM, Linda and I had lots of fun.  I took tons of photos (I've deleted some and I think I'm down to <i>only</i> 180 photos), and I even have some digital voice recordings to put on the site.  I'm hoping to get the pages done by tomorrow or Thursday.  Anyway, we didn't see any ghosts or even get a creepy feeling while we were there, which was a little disappointing.  However, I do think we caught an EVP (Electronic Ghost Phenomena - if you don't know what this is see my <a href="presentation.html">ghost hunting presentation page</a>) on the digital recorder.  We didn't hear it while we were sitting in the solitary confinement cell, and we didn't hear it when we played the recording back.   But when I downloaded the wav file to my laptop Sunday night and played it on the computer, I heard someone say &quot;hello&quot; during one of the quiet moments, and it wasn't Linda or I.  Also, it showed up on the digital recorder I used, but it didn't show up on the one Linda was using...and we were recording at the same time!  I'll be posting it out here later this week, so all of you will be able to hear it too.<br /><br />I slept until about 2PM on Saturday, I probably could have slept in much later even though that was 7 hours of sleep.  I woke up, turned the phone's ringer back on (I only turn it off when I really need the sleep).  I returned my mom's phone call, and then checked my e-mail.  While I was reading my e-mail my internet connection was terminated.  I thought nothing of it and tried to reconnect.  I wasn't able to reconnect though, I had no dial tone.  I had to call SBC, and all I found out from them was that it was an outside line problem and they would be out to fix it on Sunday.  That pissed me off, being without a phone sucks!  Sure, I could use the cell to make calls, but the cell phone doesn't let me connect to the internet...my phone line does.  I showered and got ready to go to dinner with my parents.  When I got home a few hours later my phone was working again...I have a feeling something happened to the line as a result of all the I-670 construction around my neighborhood.  Of course it doesn't matter what caused it, the important thing is that they fixed it quickly!<br /><br />Sunday I visited the Baltimore Museum with my mom.  Baltimore, OH is a very small town but they have a nice little museum.  I took quite a few pictures.  I'm planning to add it to the site too.  I think I'll create a new museum section on the site since it really doesn't fit in anyplace else.<br /><br />Well, I should get back to work.  Maybe I'll get a chance to blog again tonight!<br><br>

Unless you count all of the paranormal things that I've seen, but since &quot;ghost hunting&quot; is usually the purpose of my travels I don't consider that bizarre.<br><br>hahaha, I don't know if this is really that unusual, but back when I was in high school, Chrissie and I were driving to Grove City, OH (from Baltimore, OH) for an OMEA contest (a solo & ensemble band contest).  Chrissie was driving, she had an older car.  We had four saxophones in the trunk - a baritone, tenor, alto, and soprano.  We were on I-71, one exit away from where we needed to go when Chrissie's car started to smoke.  She pulled over to the birm, and when we got out smoke was pouring out from under the hood and from under the car!  We didn't have a cell phone with us (they weren't as common way back in 1996), and there wasn't really anyplace we could walk to that would have a phone.  So Chrissie started to dig through some of the stuff in her car.  I had no idea what she was looking for.  Then I saw she had a white kleenex in her hand.  She said that according to the Good Samaritan law people should stop when they see someone waving something white.  Well, she waved it and no one stopped.  By this point she had started to sob.  I still have a vivid picture of her in my mind sobbing, waving the white kleenex saying &quot;Aren't there any good people left in the world?!&quot;!!  I just kind of stood there, thinking &quot;why me&quot;?  Anyway, someone did end up stopping.  It was some middle aged man in a big, full-sized van.  He didn't have a cell phone, but he did offer to take us to Grove City High School for the competition...we hitchhiked!  I wasn't too thrilled about the idea, but Chrissie was already in the van, so what was I supposed to do?!?  We loaded all of the saxes into the van, and we were on our way.  I thought the guy was a little scary.  He was listening to some Christian radio station, it was almost like gospel music mixed in with sermons.  And he kept talking about the church, Christ, being saved, etc.  He seemed like one of those very extreme fundamentalist Christians, and they tend to scare me.  But we got lucky...nothing bad happened, and we even made it to the school in time for our first ensemble.  Maybe hitchhiking isn't that unusual, but it was for me.  That was the only time I did it, and I never plan on doing it again! :)<br /><li><b>If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?</b><br>I'd like to go to Europe and see all of the historical sites, especially the catacombs.<br /><li><b>Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?</b><br>If it's a long distance I'd prefer traveling by plane.  I like driving though, you get to see a lot more.  And I've never had the chance to travel by train, I think it sounds like fun though.<br /><li><b>What's the next place on your list to visit?</b><br>I'm going to Pennsylvania in September.  I'm also going back to West Virginia in September for the 2nd Annual Mothman Festival.  Of course, the trip I'm most excited about isn't until March...one of my cousins is getting married in New Orleans, so my family and I are going to go down there for the wedding and stay an extra week for vacation.  I haven't been there since spring of 1997, I can't wait!<br /></ol><br><br>

I found this in <a href="http://www.greengrl.org" target="_blank">Bonnie's blog</a> and thought it was interesting:<br /><br />I did it for my real name, Elizabeth, and for Beth (since that's what I've always gone by).

Another uneventful day in my life.  Well, take that back.  Actually I did have one semi-exciting thing happen, it is work related.  I finally found out who will be working with me on the automated testing effort.  And I didn't guess any of the people correctly, which is actually a wonderful thing since I wasn't too thrilled about the possibility of working with the people I guessed.  Turns out Shawn will be working with me on the automated stuff 100% once his current projects are finished, and Carol and Michelle will be working on it 10% so they can get up to speed so when resource/budget issues are back to normal they can start working on it more.  I personally feel that I have a great group of people to work with on this!<br /><br />I went to a three cemeteries tonight, all in Columbus.  The first cemetery wasn't too exciting, too many newer gravestones.  The second cemetery was newer than the first one, however, a lot of Chinese are buried there.  Therefore a lot of the gravestones had epitaphs written in Chinese, that was pretty cool.  And the third cemetery had quite a few older gravestones so I had lots of fun there.  Maybe I'll get them on the site this week, but I wouldn't hold my breath...I think it'll probably be next week before I have time to make another web update.<br /><br />I need to go and wash my hands now...I just had a pen leak all over them, so now they're blue.  I hate it when  that happens!<br><br>

This day is going really, really slow.  Probably because I'm exhausted from the concert.  It's really ugly outside right now, that doesn't help.  There has been some really bad lightning, it almost knocked out the power.  Well, it sort of did...the lights went out, but our computers stayed on.  It was kind of strange, usually everything electrical turns off.  <br /><br />The connection to the internet here at work is really slow today.  At first I thought I might be having problems with my site, but then I heard some other people complaining about it being slow too.  Which is good in a way, because I don't think I can take many more problems with my site!  It was completely down yesterday for over 8 hours!  Then I've had e-mail, MySQL, and FTP problems almost daily for the past few weeks.  This is getting ridiculous!  And the answer I received from Siteturn's support group made it sound like the problems might keep occuring for a few more days:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&quot;We apologize for any inconvenience that this matter has caused you. We are in the upgrading process of certain infrastructure and disk mangement systems. What you have experienced are errors and conflicts in the system which we are addressing as they appear. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience and rest assure that once we have the new systems implemented completely, you will enjoy more reliability and more features with your account.&quot;</i></blockquote><br /><br />So much for their 99.9% uptime guarantee, huh?!  I've e-mailed their billing department, I'm anxious to see if they really do guarantee this promise by crediting me for any downtime experienced.  I'm not going to hold my breathe!<br /><br />Well, time to get back to work :(<br><br>

What did I do today?  No, for a change I didn't visit any cemeteries...<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/ozz2003.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/ozzsched.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/mosh.jpg"></center><br /><br />Yep, I went to Ozzfest!!  The ticket and schedule/mosh pit warning are a bit wrinkled since they were crammed in my pocket all day, but you get the picture.  This was one of the best Ozzfests I've been too, of course the one in 1997 (with all of the riots, etc) is still my favorite!  All of the bands were awesome, I had a great time!!  And as always, I always had fun watching the people, there are definitely some strange, strange people out there! :)  Of course, I'm one to talk, huh?!<br /><br />Other than Ozzfest it was an uneventful weekend.  Yesterday I stayed home all day, which is unusual for a Saturday.  I got some &quot;advanced cleaning&quot;, AKA cleaning the closets, done.  I also printed out some directions to cemeteries around Franklin County that I'd like to visit.  I'll probably visit a couple some evening this week.  I can't believe it's finally here, Friday is the ghost hunt at the <a href="http://www.mrps.org" target="_blank">OSR (Ohio State Reformatory)</a> in Mansfield!!!!!!  I'll have to give Linda a call and find out meeting times, etc.  I am extremely excited about this, I hope I catch some strange stuff in my photos.  I'm going to try and get the photos out on the site next week.  <br /><br />Anyway, I need to shower since I smell like smoke from the concert, and since I feel dirty from sweating all day...it was soooooo humid today!  Then I need to get some sleep, I have a feeling that tomorrow is going to be a LONG day!<br><br>

I didn't get a chance to blog last night because Amanda came over for a &quot;contacting the dead&quot; party!  We had fun, and we &quot;talked&quot; to a lot of interesting spirits/ghosts.  I even found out who threw the laundry bag off my bed the other night and why they did it.  You can see the stories (there are two transcripts of questions/answers) by scrolling towards the bottom of <a href="ouija.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.  We used two different boards, that's why there are two transcripts.  You'll want to read the one from the 1920's board first.<br /><br />Since I'm at work I won't write too much (since I should be working of course!), but here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?</b><br>My alarm goes off at 5:30AM, I'm usually up by 5:45AM.<br /><li><b>Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?</b><br>I ALWAYS get up at 5:30AM, out of habit.  I usually roll over and go back to sleep for another hour or two on Saturday and Sunday though.<br /><li><b>Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?</b><br>The very first thing I do is put in my contacts so I can see!<br /><li><b>How long does it take to get ready for your day?</b><br>25 - 30 minutes since I have to put in my contacts, brush my teeth, shower, and get dressed.<br /><li><b>When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?</b><br>If I have time for a sit-down breakfast I love sausage and cheese omelettes from Bob Evans.  If I had to pick a fast food breakfast I'd have to say Burger King.<br /></ol><br><br>
