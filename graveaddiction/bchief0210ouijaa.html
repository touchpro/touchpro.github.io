On February 22, 2010 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

 This is another ouija story from someone close to me. This is his story in his own words...
<br><br>
Well, it wasn't too long ago that me and my cousins decided to play the Ouija Board.  It was around 9 PM and we were all sitting outside asking it different questions. It seemed as if it knew us well because all the things we were asking it about us were true. Many things that we have asked them about us in the future have also turned out to be true. One time when we were playing the board for like 20 minutes, my cousin and I started hearing a little cat crying.  We didn't find any cats around, and believe me if there were any cats around, my dog would have barked!  We decided to stop playing with the board because somehow we knew that the cat noise meant that bad spirits are around.
<br><br>
About 30 minutes later we started playing with the board again.  After that we stopped playing at around 11 PM, and we got the feeling that we were being watched.  As soon as we walked into my cousins house, we couldn't get rid of the feeling that somebody was watching us from every direction.  We later got over it and thought that we were just imagining things.  Soon enough, I decided to go home, and as I walked into my room I had a feeling that I wasn't alone.  I kept thinking about the board and the questions we had asked it.
<br><br>
In the morning, I got a call from my cousin telling me that he heard footsteps, and that he had his closet light go on by itself in the middle of the night.  I thought he was crazy and just trying to scare me.  The following morning I woke up to a loud banging on my wall, and I immediately went to check it out.  Behind my wall, there is a big storage room and if anything was able to fit in there it would have to be on the side where there really is no room.  Anyways, I forgot about it that same day and called my cousin to hang out.  When he answered his phone, he told me that he saw a girl standing inside his closet with the light on just staring at him. I started to think that something was very wrong and in my mind I knew that board had something to do with it.
<br><br>
The next morning, I woke up with a big scratch on my face from my right eye all the way down to the bottom of my nose, sideways.  It burned when I woke up, as I did not know how it got there.  Nobody but me could see the scratch, and I know it might sound like its impossible, but I did ask a few people to tell me how  it might have gotten there and I got the response of "I don't see anything!", "Where is it at?".  I couldn't believe how I got scratched.  It was so thin that it looked like it only could have been done with a safety pin but in a perfect straight line!  It was red for like 2 whole days, and it did not scab.  I told my cousins about it, and they didn't believe me because I only played the game with them one time.
<br><br>
I was also having nightmares that me, my girlfriend, and my mom were walking through a neighborhood.  As I walked by my girlfriend's house, she chases me.  Her face, I can't say what it really looks like because it was so bloody and I woke up with my heart beating so hard.  Sometimes I get the feeling that someone is staring at me and I feel them blowing in my ear.  I also once felt somebody walking at the corner of my bed, and I freaked out as I did not know what it was but it felt so real.  I don't know why these things still happen, but  my mom, whose room is right next to mine, says that at night somebody talks to her and she feels pressure on her chest as if someone had got on top of her and tried to choke her.  She said that she starts cursing at it, and it seems to leave.
<br><br>
We do not know what would make these things happen to me and her, but one thing I do know, as I have not told many people about, is that I could actually feel things that most people can't.  I have been told that I am psychic, sort of.  When I was playing the Ouija board, I saw images in my head, and I couldn't really make out what they were...I only kept getting like sort of a flashback.  They were not places or people that I knew.
<br><br>
I sometimes still think about what really happened that night, and I get weird thoughts and something tells me to go play again, but I know I just don't want to right now.  After all of this, things cooled off for a week and then went back to the weird things happening again.  Footsteps, people walking on the roof/attic, door knobs shaking, noises of people talking.  Just crazy things, until my cousin gave the board back to his friend.  After that day, no more crazy things have happened.
