On July 23, 2007 I received an e-mail from Tyson about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ever since we moved into our house in Southeastern Ohio when I was six years-old, I've been seeing a woman in a white gown standing by my bedside. This happens once every six months, however, I haven't seen her for two years. Wondering if she still was in my house, I borrowed my friend's Ouija Board.
<br><br>
I call this &quot;my ghostly admirer.&quot;
<br><br>
Me: May I please speak with the spirit who haunts this house?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this the spirit?<br>
Board: 2.<br>
<br>
Me: There are two spirits in my house?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: May I speak with the woman I've seen?<br>
Board: Here.<br>
<br>
Me: Is this you?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Will you spell your name out for me?<br>
Board: June.<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name June?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: What is the other spirit's name?<br>
Board: Don't know.<br>
<br>
Me: Is it a man or woman?<br>
Board: Don't know.<br>
<br>
Me: Why am I the only person in my family who can see you?<br>
Board: Son.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you think I am your son?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Do I remind you of your son?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know my name?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want to know my name?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: My name is Tyson. It's nice to meet you, June.<br>
Board: You 2.<br>
<br>
Me: June, are you scared of crossing over to the spirit world?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Then why do you stay here?<br>
Board: My house.<br>
<br>
Me: But my family lives here now.<br>
Board: Together.<br>
<br>
Me: You want you and my family to live together?<br>
Board: (circled around "yes" two times)<br>
<br>
Me: June, do you know that you scare me?<br>
Board: Sorry.<br>
<br>
Me: June, why do you watch me sleep?<br>
Board: Peacef.<br>
<br>
Me: I'm peaceful?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: June, will you please cross over to the other side, for me?<br>
Board: <i>no movement</i><br>
<br>
Me: June, are you there?<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
After that intimate session with June, I was a bit creeped out. I was alone, which I know I should not have done. That night while laying in my bed, listening to my radio and slowly falling asleep, I heard someone say my name. I sat up and looked around. I turned off the radio, and I heard it again. It was more like a sudden &quot;...aaaaAAAaaa...,&quot; but I could still hear my name in it. I have a feeling I haven't seen the last of June.
