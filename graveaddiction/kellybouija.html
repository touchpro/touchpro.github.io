On May 18, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kelly B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

When I first started out my ouija board, I lit 6-8 white candles to light the room. At first I spoke with Ouija himself, which wasn't so bad but he was annoyed at the fact I bothered him so I let him go.
<br><br>
Next I waited for about 3-5 minutes before starting again.  A young spirit came to me, and I asked her if she was well.  She said no by moving the planchette to the &quot;No&quot; answer on the board. I asked her what was wrong, and she claimed she was cold.  I asked how I could help her to feel better, then she moved the planchette to spell &quot;make,&quot; then pointed it to the sun meaning &quot;light.&quot; So I did that, and we continued our conversation.  Sure enough, she warmed up to me. I asked her how old she was, and she kept telling me no at first, so I decided to play a guessing game. I asked her if she was over 20 and she said no. I asked her if she was under 16 she said yes. I asked her then if she was under 12 and she said yes. I asked her if she was under 10 and she said yes, and I am thinking to myself &quot;wow, she is young.&quot;.  I asked her if she was 9 she and said no.  Finally, when I asked her if she was 8, she said yes.
<br><br>
I asked her if she was a blonde girl and she said yes. I asked if she had blue eyes and she said no. I asked her if she had brown eyes and she said yes, so I came to this small description that she was an 8 year old girl who was a blonde
and had brown eyes.
<br><br>
This puzzled me, so I continued to ask her a few more general questions.  Another question I asked her was &quot;how did you die?&quot;  She spelled out a name &quot;Kelb Greck.&quot;  I asked if he hurt her, and she said yes.  I asked her if her murdered here, and she said yes.  I was a bit more puzzled, and I told her gently &quot;I am sorry to hear that, may I ask your name dear spirit?&quot;  She spelled out her name to the effect of &quot;Fefe Elvas.&quot; So now I got a
description a bit more clearly, saying I encountered a spirit who is 8 years old, her name is Fefe Elvas, she has a brother, a father but no mother, she was murdered by a guy named Kelb Greck...and to further my investigation, I asked her where she was murdered.  She spelled out &quot;here.&quot;  Now this is mind blowing to me, and I asked her if she is the little girl who is in my basement watching me, then she spelled out yes.
<br><br>
I asked her gently to prove to me that she was a spirit, and she spelled out &quot;haunt.&quot; I said ONLY on the walls and nothing more...she then spelled out &quot;K,&quot; and no word of a lie I has seen her body!! She is such a good little spirit too. I asked her to return to the board and she did, she was very cooperative.  I told her we will continue our conversation later and she spelled out &quot;K.&quot;  Because I kept yawning, she asked me if I was tired and I
said yes.  She said &quot;me too&quot; and we both said goodbye and goodnight.
<br><br>
I then flipped the board over, with the planchette flipped over too, and that was my experience with the Ouija Board.
<br><br>
However, I am very good at Ouija-ing alone so don't Ouija alone unless you know what you are capable of and are sure of what you're encountering.
