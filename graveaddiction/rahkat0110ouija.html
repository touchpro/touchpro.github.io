On January 6, 2010 I received an e-mail from Rahera and Katrina about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>


Recently my friends and I have been experimenting with using the ouija board.  We have researched how to use it, and what not to do.  Lately we have been encountering what I think is a trickster.  He seems to mean me no harm, but to the others he does.  I'm the newest to this, but I can still feel the bad vibes coming from him.  My other friend, who is the most experienced and knowledgeable is also getting bad vibes.  We know he is a bad spirit as he is tries to go to four corners, tries to make a figure eight, tries to cycle through the alphabet and numbers, and tries to move the planchette off the board. He doesn't even bother trying to answer our questions anymore...he just tries to do all of the above straight away.  He spells words related to sinister things, and recently attempted to spell Lucifer.
<br><br>
Two of our younger and more ignorant friends like talking to him, thinking they want &quot;action.&quot;  We both know how dangerous the ouija board can be, and we have tried to warn them, but it just seems to fall on deaf ears.  The spirit seems to be stronger when we aren't there with them. Which is most of the time now.  The youngest one believes in god, we know that this protects her a little, but also could make her a target as stated on the website. Words of prayer don't seem to work, because we always manage to get the same spirit, and no matter how much we warn them, they never listen to us.
<br><br>
Lately they have encountered something different, and we have found no mention of this on your website.  The spirit had tried everything possible to escape, but then he tried something different.  He began alternating between two letters, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;E,&quot; and then &quot;M&quot; and &quot;I.&quot; What does this mean?

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Rahera and Katrina, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a>, and I will forward it on.
