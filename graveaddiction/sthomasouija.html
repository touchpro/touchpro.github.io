On November 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Shaun Thomas about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ok this is a HONEST TO GOD true story that occured around midnight on the 5th of November 2006. I had just bought an OUIJA board and was eager to use it. Me (Shaun) and three mates, Ben and James (twins) and Damen as well.
<br><br>
We went to a school yard, sat down on cement, and lit about 7 candles: one black, three white and three tea lights.
<br><br>
We said a prayer, and asked a spirit to come forth. After a minute or so, the planchette moved. We had our fingers only lightly, so light that they almost slipped off. We asked who was talking and it spelt out K-Y-L-E.
<br><br>
We asked if it knew anyone there and it pointed to Ben. We asked if they knew each other and it said no. Kyle said he was 19 and that he died when he was 17. We asked what high school and it began to spell out P-I-M (Ben went to PIMLICO), and I asked Pimlico? It then spelt out &quot;L-E-T M-E  F-I-N-I-S-H.&quot;  We apologised and asked what their relationship was, and it spelled out &quot;H-A-T-E.&quot;
<br><br>
We asked why, and it spelt out L-I-A-R. It continued to spell out LIES and NO TRUST and would not divulge his last name or give any hints. We asked if it had anyone else to talk to and it said &quot;JAMES&quot; (Ben's twin), and James asked what it would like him to do...and it replied &quot;CRY&quot; and James asked why, and it said &quot;HATE&quot; again. We then said Goodbye and it said NO, and then DIE...and we closed the board and ended the session with a protection prayer. It was freaky and I am no longer skeptical!
<br><br>
We tried again two more times and got freaky results, but I will write about them later. We were freaked out about this first experience and amazed also. The Ouija Board is REAL.
