On July 22, 2005 I received an e-mail from Britney about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My name is Britney and I just turned 16 on July 19, 2005. Well, on my birthday I had a party and some friends spent the night.  I have had an ouija board for about a year, but I hadn't used it in like 8 months.  Well, a couple of my friends had never played one before so we decided to try it.  It took awhile to work, and after only talking to one spirit we got bored.  We had one candle lit, and I have one of those lighter things that you click and it makes a flame.  I was just kinda playing around with it and started trying to light the ouija board cardboard box on fire, but it would only make a little glow then die out.  So then I started trying to light the corners of the actual ouija board on fire.  I own the new glow in the dark ouija board.  Well, it just kinda made the corners black, I wasn't really trying to burn it. I had bought the ouija board with my own money, because I didn't believe my stepdad when he said it worked.  It had cost like 35 dollars, so I didn't want to burn it.  
<br><br>
Then I was playing with a tissue and the lighter, we had stopped playing the ouija board but it was still out.  I would light a little piece of the tissue the blow it out.  Well, the 3rd time I did that it caught fire. I tried to smush it out while I was holding it but I couldn't and I ended up dropping it on the carpet.  By this time it was on fire and I tried to pat it out wih my hand but it wouldn't go out so I grabbed the nearest thing which was one of those decorative party napkins that are rough.  I tried to use it to pat it out instead of my hand.  And at the same time I yelled for someone to get my shoe.  My friend hands it to me and we finally get the fire out. Thankfully only the tissues burned and only a small piece of the carpet was ruined.  But it left a big black mark and we had to cut the burned tissue out of it.  It really burned my carpet, there is a small rough spot and its lower then the rest of the carpet around it.  
<br><br>
Then later on as we tried to play the ouija board again, I was just kidding and I was saying that the ouija board made the carpet set fire because I had been trying to set it on fire.  Well, ever since then we haven't gotten a response from the ouija board.  It's only been a couple of days since the fire but the board hasn't worked since then but we're still trying.  We are going to take it to my friend's house to see if it will work there.  The ouija board doesn't reallly scare me, I just make sure no one asks if the spirit is evil because one time it said yes.  So now I just don't let anyone ask that question.  I don't know if the board made the fire start or it was just coincidence, but I'm just careful with it now.&quot;
