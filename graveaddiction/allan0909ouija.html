On September 23, 2009 I received an e-mail from Allan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Allan, and I'm 19 living in UK West Midlands.  Back in February, I made my own ouija board on a wooden board and carved out the letters.  I haven't used it yet because I can't find anybody to do it with me.  So its in my wardrobe at the bottom of my bed.   When I made it, I took photos of it on my mobile.  When I edited the photos, I put it on negative so it was blue and black, and when zooming in there is clearly a demon's face, but it looks more like the devil with horns.  I have lost the picture now.
<br><br>
A few months ago, I was alseep...it was about 4 in the morning when I suddenly got an image flash in my eyes (while I was asleep).  It was some sort of creature. When I saw this, I woke up and was like having a fit.  I was grabbing ahold of my mattress, trying to stay still, but the force was heavy.  It was trying to pull me off the bed and toss me around onto my back.  Then after five minutes I stopped and closed my eyes.   Trying to go back to sleep.  As soon as I closed my eyes, I had a flash of the entity again.  It was sort of a creature, its flesh was gooey and it had like a bat looking face.  As soon as I saw the image again, I started having a fit again.  Every time I closed my eyes it kept happening, then after about 6 times I just thought: I'm in control here, and I don't know why I imagined this, but it worked. I just imagined it flying away in an UFO, then it didn't come back and I got back to sleep.
<br><br>
When I woke up in the morning, I couldn't believe what happened - it's never happened to me before.  I always feel like I'm being watched, and that something is there...where it gets to the point that I'm too scared to turn around.   Was it just a night terror, or was it more demonic?  I don't want to get rid of my ouija board, but if anybody has any opinions on what happened to me, and if what's happening is unusual, then please email me please.  I don't know if this is anything to do with it, but I'm having nightmares every night.  My friends tell me it's weird because they never dream as much as me, let alone nightmares, but they inspire me to write stories.  Please send me your suggestions. Thank you!

<br><br><br>
If anyone has any advice for Allan, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on to him.
