On March 12, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jessica Frazier about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I've always been told that ouija boards are either a load of crap or evil, and dangerous...I don't believe either one of those theories, so I bought one.
<br><br>
We've used it in many different cemeteries and abandoned houses, but one strange event that stands out in my memory happened when seven other friends and I took it to an old abandoned house to see what would happen.  While five of us explored the house finding horse slaughtering contraptions and the skeletons of dead, undeterminable &quot;things&quot;, two of the other girls used my board.  Suddenly, while we were standing around the participants of the board, we saw the board start to go crazy. Then it stopped to spell &quot;move&quot;, and continued to spell &quot;let me out&quot; repeatedly. So we hauled ass out of there!  Halfway down the road, I felt a gut-wrenching pain and ended up vomiting.
<br><br>
Well, about eight months later I came across a psychic and decided to have my tarot read...as it was, I'd been told they were a load of crap also.  Asking NO questions whatsoever about me and witchcraft, she asked if I owned an ouija board.  I said yes, and she told me that I need to get rid of it and that there are evil spirits all around me.  She said that I had opened a door that I can't close. Not believing her, I still have the board to this day, and strange things happen around me.  I hear singing in a monotone voice, strange rumbling noises, and I also read things backwards sometimes (especially numbers). And YES, I've been tested for dyslexia, and NO, I do NOT have it. Is there any answer for this?&quot;
<br><br><br>
In September 2006 I received an e-mail from Tammy Schaeffer with some advice for Jessica:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>First, let me tell you my story. Me and my five friends wanted to contact the dead, so my friend Ellie had a board.  We talked to some spirits (not to mention that we had some encounters too). My friend's sister, Ruby, said we shouldn't play around with it, but my friend Nick was curious about it so we continued. We talked to a 54 year old guy named Rusty who was violently killed.  The freaky part was that he said my best friend Nick was going to die the same way! So thinking it was a joke, we laughed and he said it's no joking matter, he will die. Then my grandpa contacted me (he died when I was a baby so I didn't know him, but heard some cool stories from my brother). My grandma said he is watching over me.  Suddenly, I feel something hugging me and he said &quot;It'll be okay sweetie, I am here.&quot;  I started to cry nonstop and my friend Beckie continued. One of Nick's relatives contacted him and he was crying too.  But my advice...DON'T play with the board, it can bring you BAD luck forever!</i></blockquote>
<br>
I also received an e-mail from Sarah Hoffman in September 2006, with some more advice for Jessica:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>Just wanted to say that you are brave for keeping the board, but spirits do get out when you use them.   Trust me, I know because my sister (back when she was 14 years old) had one and used it in the room beside mine.  And guess what happened?  She got the shit scared out of her, and there's still weird shit going on in that room!  Even when it's 90 degrees outside, it's probably only 40 degrees in there...and it's only in the room where she did it.  It's really scary, and boy o' boy!! When it's late at night you can hear people talking, and stuff being moved, and all kinds of shit...But I just wanted to let you know what happened to her.  My mom said I'm not allowd to have one, lol. Just be careful!</i></blockquote>

If you have any advice for Jessica, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll send your advice on to her.
