On June 5, 2007 I received an e-mail from Sophie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I had these friends over, and they didn't belive me when I said that I can talk to spirits. Well, one day they came over and I asked them if they wanted to talk to my sister. They said OK, because my sister was upstairs.  But I said that I didn't mean her (I'm adopted)...I meant my blood related sister.  They said sure, let's talk to her.
<br><br>
We got everything ready, and then I said &quot;Are there any spirits in the room?&quot;  It immediately answered yes, so I asked if I could talk to my sister and it said yes again (I've talked to her before).  So I asked her how she was doing,and she said not good.  I asked her why?, and she said that it was the day when she got in a car accident.  I apologized, and then I asked if she still wanted to talk.  She said sure, so by this time my friends were very scared, but I calmed them down.
<br><br>
Then I asked if she could possess me...not in the creepy, scary, need a priest way, but if she could go in and out of
our bodies.  She said she couldn't, so we said that was fine.  But then all of a sudden my friend started getting really freaked out, so I said we would be back later.  We all said goodbye and all. But a few minutes later we found out that my friend got possessed.  We calmed her down, and then we went to the ouija board and told the spirit to exit her body.  It
finally left, and my friend was like we are never doing this again!!! A few weeks later we moved to California and I made so many friends that love this board.  But be careful about what you say to it!!!
