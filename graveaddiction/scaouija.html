On May 29, 2006 I received an e-mail from Alicia about an interesting ouija board experience she had with her friends:
<br><br><br>
Carly/Alicia:
<br><br>
May 27th, 2006
<br><br>
We were getting rather bored around the seventh straight episode of Family Guy. Our cousin, Sami, was looking through the game closet and found Angie's Ouija board. She'd never really used it and condoned us borrowing it for the night.
<br><br>
Now, we're not BIG fans of magic or Ouija boards, and we'd only tried it once five years ago. The board was nothing fancy. It was the most modern version, or common as you might say.
<br><br>
Since we're beginners, we didn't know any signs of trouble.
<br><br>
At first we tried asking it a stupid question...
<br><br>
Sami/Carly: Does anything rhyme with nostril?<br>
Board: *no movement*<br>
<br>
We got discouraged quickly because we're new and grew bored of waiting. We basically just looked up some music for about five minutes. We took a look back down at the board and noticed that the planchette had distinctly moved over the letter C. Well, we didn't know what that meant...so we decided to ask a different question.
<br><br>
Sami/Carly: Is the Ouija board just a game?<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Carly/Alicia: Is there anyone who wants to talk?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Sami/Alicia: What is your name?<br>
<br>
This is where things got weird. I'm convinced that the board was completely confused. The planchette went up between the letters U and V. It went over to W and stopped. After a while it went up between the letters G and H. It then went from H backwards through the alplabet to A and stopped. It became faster and went to R and stopped. Then even faster down to 3 and stopped. It went down and then swept through goodbye. Then, almost violently, the planchette slid off the board.
<br><br>
Since we are clueless....we totally freaked out. We hit the lights and stopped. After we composed ourselves, we decided to continue.
<br>
Sami/Alicia: Are you male or female?<br>
Board: Female<br>
<br>
Sami/Alicia: How old are you?<br>
Board: 53<br>
<br>
We were getting tired and decided to call it a night. However, we did not know much about the board and didn't even say goodbye {we're idiots.}
<br><br>
We hope the next time we attempt to talk...we'll remember to be more polite.
