On May 3, 2008 I received an e-mail from Brandon about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It happened a few weeks ago when I bought the ouija board at my local Toys R Us from having fears of evil spirits haunting me once a month! Well, I bought it with my older brother and a friend, and we decided to mess with it that very night.  We sat side by side with the ouija board laid flat on my floor in front of both of us.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits in the room with us?<br>
Ouija: <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
Me: Are there any spirits that want to talk to us? We're willing to listen!<br>
Ouija: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Ouija: <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
Me: Who is your spirit guardian?<br>
Ouija: <i>no response</i><br>
<br>
After about ten minutes, my friend decided to give up and watch television.  This is where we knew something was wrong.  She headed towards my switch to turn the ceiling light on when the light suddenly, with a loud pop, blew out.  My room became dark again.  She threw my bedroom door open where my grandfather and brother sat in the sitting room, and said she would never play the game again.
<br><br>
The same night I took the ouija to another friend's house to play.  The ouija board didn't answer at all this time, but this event scared the heck out of my friend.  We were in the bathroom together...I was sitting down while she was playing with my hair (this was about 10 minutes after playing with the ouija board).  Her lights started flickering on and off.  She threw her comb down and shot down to her bedroom.  She told me to get that &quot;devil game&quot; out of her house and advised me to burn it.  PEOPLE, THESE ARE REAL EVENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD; MY FAMILY HAS INSISTED THAT I TAKE IT BACK OR THROW IT AWAY..IT'S NOT A GAME OR A TOY.
