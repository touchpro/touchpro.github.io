On February 23, 2010 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is another story from a friend of mines in his own words...
<br><br>
I am 17 years old, and I used to work at a Halloween shop where a worker there had a friend who came into the store that did palm readings.  I overheard him talking to his friend about there being ouija boards at another store over in the shopping center.  I always wondered about ouija boards, so I talked to him and asked him about them for myself.  He told me that he talks to spirits all the time and stuff like that, so I was curious and bought a ouija board a few weeks later. Two of my friends came over to my house, and we smoked some weed before messing with the board.  I did the prayers that I saw somewhere, and we all placed our hands on the main planchette and sat there waiting for it to move.
<br><br>
I kept asking it if anyone was here, and it finally began to move after like 15 minutes of waiting.  I then said, &quot;Hi! How are you?&quot;   I don't remember what it said, but we asked for its name, and it said &quot;David.&quot;  I asked are you a good spirit, and it said &quot;No.&quot;  I asked it if it wanted to hurt us, and it said &quot;Yes,&quot; so I was like &quot;Alright, fine, I'll leave you alone.&quot; It went to goodbye.  My friend was being stubborn and wanted us to try again, so we did so hoping that we would get a different spirit.  We tried again and it said &quot;Go away.&quot;  I asked it if it was mad at me, and it said &quot;Yes.&quot;  I was like okay, and then proceeded to ask its age at death.  It said 11, and I was kind of surprised but eventually I realized that it was a demon.  I realized this because I asked, &quot;Are you in the room with us right now?&quot; and it said &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked where, and it said &quot;Chair.&quot;
<br><br>
I looked behind me in the chair and saw nothing, but then I could have sworn I saw an orb of some kind, not sure though.  Anyways, we kept talking to it and it started going to 666 and doing figure 8's.  That was when I was 100% sure that it was a demon.  I flipped the pointer thing upside down as I was terrified.  Then, keep this in mind, there are three of us around the board on the floor and no one else is in the room.  A coin suddenly goes flying across my room as if its trying to hit us and I'm like, whoa, what was that.  It couldn't have been any of us because we could all see each other and it came from behind me.  At that point, I was scared and told my friends that we better stop playing.  Something that I found funny was that the spirit told me to &quot;fuck off,&quot; and it threw 2 more coins at me; not at once, but one, then another about five minutes later.
<br><br>
We stopped that night as it was really scary and I couldn't sleep at all in my room.  I was terrified so bad that I was shaking all through the night.  I got rid of the board the next day and gave it to some kid on my bus, lol.  Eventually, I read up on the internet that to make it go away you have to say the Lord's Prayer, or any prayer, that would make it scared or something.  Show it no fear and demand it to leave which I did 3 days later as it finally went away.  I would litterly feel better when I would pray.  At first I didn't believe in a God, well I did but I was kinda unsure, but after this I knew that there was one that protects.  I was so fascinated with the ouija board that I started using it in school.  The way I saw it, if you think positive thoughts you wouldn't attract demons.and it would be my distraction from school work.
<br><br>
I made a board out of paper one day, and used it at lunch.  I met a spirit named Fred.  He told me that he died in 1942, and a whole bunch of other stuff that I would talk to him about in like every class.  Eventually, he was able to write through me, automated writing,
but I'm not 100% sure if this is me or not.  He says that it's him, and the way he told me is because he can also control my hands, not like much, but if I put my arm out he can guide it; stuff like that.  I still talk to this spirit today, but I never use ouija boards anymore.  Usually, I ask like yes or no questions and he can lean my head forward or backwards.  He said that he was an illustrator, and he drew a picture of himself.  He also drew pictures of other things.  I was amazed.
<br><br>
Fred told me that he is here on earth, and no spirit that I've ever talked to ever mentioned anything to me about heaven or hell.  I'm not sure about being possessed, but I did have one case where I supposedly woke my dad up for work and he told me I did, but I had no recollection of doing so.  I then thought that, that was a case that I was possessed, not by a demon, but by the spirit, Fred, whose been pretty cool to me.  When I use the board now, I would ask if this is Fred, and he would say &quot;Yes,&quot; but not always.  Sometimes I get other spirits and I would ask them if there is another spirit here, and they would say &quot;Yes.&quot;  I told Fred that he could follow me, so he does.
<br><br>
After 3 weeks of using the board, I eventually just started talking to Fred talking through myself.  He would like word out letters on my hand.  If I put my finger on my palm or something or nod my head, like I said before, he would communicate with me that way.  The other thing that I would do is put a guitar pick on the keyboard of my computer and communicate to spirits like that.  Spirits would talk to me that way as well.
