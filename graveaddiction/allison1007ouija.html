On October 14, 2007 I received an e-mail from Allison B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My friend and I were playing with a Ouija Board at her house and we were talking to our usual spirit, Rick. So we were talking for a little while and then took a break.  When we came back, Rick was gone and we had a new spirit. This one was kinda scary. First he told us Rick was crazy (Rick is not crazy - we have spoken to him many times and he is very nice and funny).  Then we asked if he was sure, because Rick never acted like this spirit. This spirit started moving the planchette in all different directions. We then asked if the spirit was crazy and it quickly sped to NO. That scared us so we flippped the board and got Rick back. Rick wouldn't come at first, so jokingly my friend said &quot;c'mon, I'll strip for you!!&quot; So we ask for a spirit, and it says &quot;Wheres my strippers?&quot; Rick knew we needed to feel comfortable so he came back. Rick then kept saying my friend was hot and that he was horny. So we kept getting good spirits because Rick made us happy. We also got an annoying spirit, and all she did was joke and say &quot;jk&quot; and &quot;LOL!&quot; So I'm happy to say I've had mainly good experiences and only a few bad. I'm trying to show a good side to this game.
