On February 3, 2006 I received an e-mail from Anna about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I was having a party with my friends Dani, Max, Mika, and Tiffany. A few days prior to the party I had told them I was getting an ouija board on the first of February, so Max immediatley asked to use the board.  The party was at Mika's house.
<br><br>
Max: Hi Spirits! Is anyone there?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Max: Why not?<br>
Board: Go<br>
<br>
Max: Go where?<br>
Board: Out<br>
<br>
Max: But I don't want to go out.<br>
Board: Then sadness come<br>
<br>
Max: Sadness from what?<br>
Board: No tell you<br>
<br>
Anna: Hello spirit, it's me, Anna. I believe we've met before.<br>
Board: Hello<br>
<br>
Anna: What is your name?<br>
Board: Alexandrea<br>
<br>
Anna: How did you die, Alexandrea?<br>
Board: Cut<br>
<br>
Anna: Cut where?<br>
Board: Myself<br>
<br>
Anna: Why did you cut yourself?<br>
Board: Hate world<br>
<br>
Anna: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 13<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Ok, my turn!! Hiya spirit!<br>
Board: Hello<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Where did you live before you died?<br>
Board: Rome<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Italy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>

My friend Mika didn't believe in the ouija board and claimed we were moving it the whole time. He got into the conversation.
<br><br>
Mika: You guys are moving the board yourselves.<br>
Anna: No we are not!<br>
Mika: Yeah right!<br>
Max: Ask the spirit something.<br>
Mika: Do something to my house then.<br>
Board: *no movement*<br>
<br>
Anna: Mika, you idiot!<br>
Max: She could blow up your house! She's a spirit!<br>
Mika: Whatever. It's not like anything happened.<br>
<br>
Then we heard a crash from upstairs. As Mika ran upstairs with us following, I knew Mika was in trouble.
<br><br>
Mika's room had been torn apart.
<br><br>
Mika: What happened to my room!?!<br>
Anna: I warned you.<br>
Max: Anna, Mika...come look at this!<br>
<br>
As we went over to where Max was, he was pointing to the wall that had the words &quot;THIS IS JUST BEGINNING. I WILL BE BACK&quot; painted in red paint or, as Max claims, in blood. The next day (which is today) was as Alexandrea said. At 3:00 in the morning, Max called me and said that his grandfather who was 46 died that morning. As for Mika, I haven't heard from him and he wasn't at school today so I'm kinda worried.&quot;
