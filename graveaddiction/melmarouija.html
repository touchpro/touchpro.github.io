On April 23, 2005 I received an e-mail from Melissa about the scary ouija board experience she and her friend Marilyn had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;One day my sister, cousin, friend, and I decided to buy the ouija.  We bought it and we were all scared but we still played.  At first we didn't belive it because it didn't want to move so we were mad and put it away.  Later on that day we all decided to go to the beach with all of our friends.  There was about 20 people with us.  We took the ouija with us.  We tried to play it but everybody started to make jokes and laugh at the ouija board, so it didn't even move.  We just quit and put it away.  The whole night everyone was saying how stupid and fake the ouija was.  When we were leaving we put the whole game on back of a truck.  We were going home and that's when we saw the game flying out of the truck into the freeway.  When we got home everyone stopped and looked behind the truck and found the ouija board and the  planchette with no box or anything else.  Everyone was so freaked out because we saw the whole box flying and we couldn't find out how the board and planchette appeared in the truck.  When one of our friends saw it they got the board and broke it and threw away the planchette and the board in the street.  That night no one slept and everyone regreted laughing at the ouija.  So if  you play make sure you don't laugh at it because it is not only a game.&quot;
