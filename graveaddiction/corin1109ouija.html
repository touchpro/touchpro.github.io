On November 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Corin about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I've just learned about oujia boards about three days ago (One of those days I spent a whole night researching it).  But anyway, I've been so addicted to them for those three days i decided to do a real one in my room with my friend.  At first it was doing nothing, and my friend was like, &quot;well this is balls,&quot; but then it started to work.
<br><br>
Me: Are there people present?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: How many people?<br>
Board: 9.<br>
<br>
Me: Seriously? (shocked face!)<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Could I ask your name please, my friend?<br>
Board: no.<br>
Board: 666.<br>
<br>
By this time I was a little freaked out, but my friend said he was probably just joking. I didn't think so.
<br><br>
Me: Are you a demon?<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Me: Evil spirit?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: awwh crap.<br>
Board: 666.<br>
<br>
Me: You really enjoy 666, am I right?<br>
Board: 666.<br>
<br>
Me: OK, we get it! geez.<br>
Board: 66-<br>
<br>
I stopped it in the middle because it was pissing me off!<br>
<br>
Me: Could you please tell me your name!<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Me: Pretty please?<br>
Board: fuck you.<br>
<br>
Me: Don't be so rude!<br>
Board: shut up.<br>
<br>
I was getting pissed off really badly, and Liam was laughing.<br>
<br>
Board: 666<br>
Board: 777<br>
Board: 888<br>
<br>
Me: You enjoy doing numbers in triples?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Don't make me come over there and slap you silly boooyyy (I was just getting bored and pissed off at this point)<br>
Board: hahahahaha<br>
<br>
Me: You think I couldn't?<br>
Board: no no no no<br>
<br>
Me: Make a noise if you think you're sooo cool.<br>
Board: B-A-N-G<br>
<br>
(It didn't make any real noise at all, just spelled it out =.=)<br>
<br>
Me: You take the piss 666 guy.<br>
<br>
(after about an hour of 666 and stuff, we started to ask serious questions and he for some reason answered.)<br>
<br>
My friend: How long have you been here then, 666 guy?<br>
board: 2.<br>
<br>
Me: Years?<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Me: Months?<br>
Board: no.<br>
<br>
Me: Weeks?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: So you've been watching me?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
Board: naked.<br>
<br>
Me: You've been watching me naked :O!<br>
Board: yes.<br>
Board: hahahahaha.<br>
<br>
My friend had to go then, and we were about to leave and we had just said goodbye as the door slammed.<br>
<br>
Me: was that you 666 guy?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do it again?<br>
<br>
(door opened and closed)<br>
<br>
Me: Woooah! We're going now.  Goodbye, have fun!<br>
Board: goodbye.<br>
<br>
Well, thats my story, I'm really scared.  It feels really cold in many places in my room now.  I think he watches me all the time, but I'm not too bothered.  Once I meet my spirit guide I'll be happy, until then I'm going to keep doing ouija boards.
<br><br>
Oh yeah, I nearly forgot...I did another after this, and we met some guys.  My friend was really curious about spirit guides, and he decided to ask if they were there (our spirit guides).  The spirit said yes, and we asked if we could talk to them.  The spirit said, &quot;no, it is not time yet.&quot; It confuzzled the fuck outta me, and he told us to stop talking about them. Why is it not time for me to talk to my spirit guides?
