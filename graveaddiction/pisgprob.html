It is the burial place of Christian Layman, who is mentioned in Perry County history books.
<br><br>    
It is also the final resting place of many veterans of America's Civil War; It is the Pisgah Cemetery on Avalon Road outside of Somerset, and it is in trouble.
<br><br>
<b>Needs Local Support</b>
<br><br>
The historical Pisgah Cemetery (pronounced Piz-gah) is a small cemetery alongside Avalon Road in Reading Township, west of Somerset.  The first Pisgah Cemetery Association was incorporated on August 26, 1922, when the cemetery land was deeded from the United Brethren Church to the association.
<br><br>
Rose Mary Founds of Somerset is now the only trustee left, and serves as treasurer.  &quot;My father was treasurer, and now that he's passed away, I'm the only one left,&quot; said Founds.  For a couple of years she was able to have the cemetery cared for from the small amount of funds which were available.  Now those funds are almost completely gone.  
<br><br>
Good friends such as Bob and Carol Knight, and relatives such as daughter-in-law Dala (Guisinger) Founds and Heather Founds of New Lexington and Ann Johnson have helped Rose Mary form a new board of trustees, but they are in need of help in finding other families who have loved ones buried in the cemetery, who may be able to help take care of it.
<br><br>
During recent years, the grounds have been damaged by four-wheeler users who have taken joy rides through the cemetery; its remote location unfortunately invites vandalism.  
<br><br>
<b>Dates back to War of 1812</b>
<br><br>
Some of the Perry County family names seen often throughout the cemetery are Wright, Householder, and Sein.  Many of the tombstones have eroded away and some of the inscriptions are either barely legible or almost gone; some date back to the War of 1812.  The search for a burial plot map has so far been futile.
<br><br>
<b>'A lot of history here...'</b>
<br><br>
Founds mentioned &quot;Christian Layman, who is buried here, is my great-great grandfather.  My great grandparents are buried here as well as my grandparents.  Christian's father was a pastor, Reverend Adam Jacob Layman, who started the United Brethren Conference in Columbus, which is now United Methodist.  So there's a lot of history here.  Several years ago, inmates at Camp Reams in Lancaster, Ohio helped out to clear brush out of the area, but it grows back so quickly.&quot;
<br><br>
Anyone who can help or wishes to make a donation can call Founds at 1-740-743-1050, or write her at P.O. Box 626, Somerset, OH, 43783.  The cemetery board has an account at the U.S. Bank in Somerset.
