On January 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Samuel P. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Recently, I had some friends over and we were playing Ouija in my basement. Two of my friends didn't believe anything would happen, and were all negative towards it and stuff. We had done this before, without the two negative friends, but more on that later. When we were doing the ouija board with the two extra friends, they didn't believe it and they were making fun of it and stuff like that. We made them take their hands off, then the three who believed in it played. We contacted evil spirits, and after asking if they came in the name of the Holy Spirit, they said no. We asked if they loved Jesus, and they said no. They started to spell out &quot;Die,&quot; and we flipped the board over and restarted in a few minutes. This time, we asked how many were there. There were four evil spirits. We moved the ouija into another room and played there. This time, there were eight spirits, all evil. I think they were attracted because a few of the people there didn't like one person, and the two extra friends were being all negative towards it. We continued for a bit, then said goodbye and flipped over the board.
<br><br>
The last time I did this, we had no idea how to properly use a ouija board, and this resulted in kind of a freaky sleeping night. I also left the ouija board in my bedroom, where I heard weird noises and stuff like that all night. This time, I put it back in the box and moved it upstairs, and I never heard a thing. I also want to tell anyone that the board cannot be used unless there is a very strong spirit if no one is touching it. You can use your faith in God (or whatever religion, or in yourself if you're an Athiest) to banish them from your house using a simple prayer. This always worked for me.
