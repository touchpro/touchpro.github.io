On January 24, 2005 I received an e-mail from Trish Fogle, a website visitor.  Not only did she share some fantastic ouija board tips (that you can view by <a href="ouijatips.html">clicking here</a>), but she also shared some of her ouija stories:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I had never messed with Ouija boards because I had always been told how bad or evil they are, while growing up.  I was scared to death of getting possessed or having spirits in my house that I couldn't get rid of, so I never really wanted to play with a Ouija.  That was, until 3 months ago.  Now at the age of 25, I'm hooked!
<br><br>
I was at my friend, Chance's house, and we somehow got into a discussion about a Ouija board.  She had told me about a scary experience that she had a few years before with one.  I was kind of joking around, and said, &quot;We should make one and see if it works!&quot;  She said, &quot;Well, actually, we could probably make one out of paper.&quot;  So, Chance got a piece of huge poster paper, and started  writing the letters, numbers and the usual things you see on a real Ouija.  She then wrote a writ of protection on the back of the poster paper, because  she read that you should do that every
time you play, to prevent negative or hostile spirits from coming through.  We used a small glass cup for a planchette.  We each read the writ of protection out loud, and I also said a silent prayer for extra protection.  To our surprise, it started working immediately!  I have heard that sometimes you have to wait and concentrate usually before anything happens, but with us, that was not the case; although it seemed the spirit had a little bit of trouble communicating
with our board that we made, and some words would be mixed up, and also some of the messages wouldn't make sense.  The spirit, &quot;Al&quot;, said that he was trying to familiarize himself with the board.  I thought it would be a scary experience, but the spirit that we had talked to turned out to be a friendly one, and it was very fun for us.
<br><br>
Chance decided to buy a real Ouija to see if our experience would be even better.  She ended up buying one called The Pyschic Circle, which is much more detailed than a regular Ouija, and makes it easier for spirits to communicate, since it has words, symbols, astrological signs, etc. on the board.  I definately recommend this board.
<br><br>
Anyway, as before, the planchette worked almost immediately and went to &quot;Hello&quot;.  &quot;Al&quot; had come through again. I had been reading a little bit of one of Sylvia Browne's books, (a famous psychic who is often on Montel Williams show) and I decided to ask &quot;Al&quot; if the things that Sylvia Browne said were true or false.  He said that she was for real.  So then I asked if we had Spirit Guides, and he said yes, that he was in fact, Chance's Spirit Guide.  We started with the usual questions to test him, such as, when our birthdays were, and he was correct.  We then
started to ask questions about our lives.  It was fun, and &quot;Al&quot; was very nice, and also had a sense of humor!
When we got comfortable talking with &quot;Al&quot; we would ask silly questions, and he would give us silly answers.  We would laugh and joke around, and it was a lot of fun.  A couple other spirits came through, but &quot;Al&quot; seemed to come in the strongest.
<br><br>
The third time we played the Ouija I decided that I wanted to meet my Spirit Guide this time.  I asked &quot;Al&quot; if I could speak to my Spirit Guide, and he said yes, and then the planchette went to &quot;Hello&quot;.  That is when I met my Spirit Guide, Boz.  It was very interesting.  I asked about past lives, and how many kids I would have, and all the usual questions people ask.  I felt a closeness to Boz right away, as well as positive energy.
<br><br>
I never expected to experience what I have through the Ouija, which is to gain more knowledge as well as being more open to Spiritualism.  I thought it would be fun to talk to spirits, but I never thought it would open my eyes to spirituality.
<br><br>
I believe that the Ouija can be used for different purposes.  For those who wish to talk to spirits on the other side and are just looking to have fun with it, it serves its purpose for those people.  For those who have questions about their own lives or spiritualism  and want to ask their Spirit Guides, their Higher Selves or even a loved one's spirit who
has crossed over, the Ouija is an excellent tool, as they will be honest, and give you excellent advice or even just friendly words of encouragement and/or support.
<br><br>
A Ouija board is also a great way for someone to open themselves to the psychic world or to open your senses and intuition.  In my case, I became interested in doing research on what I was being told by spirits and my Spirit Guide. I didn't know much about Spirit Guides, so I went on the internet and did a lot of research on them and learned a lot.  Then I would talk to my Guide on the Ouija again, and ask more questions about their role in my life and other spiritual
questions.  The more I learned, the more open and sensitive I became to my Guide and I began to have experiences.  All good ones, of course.  If you don't want it to happen, it won't.  But if you are truly interested in making contact with your Guide to open your senses to other things, (without using a Ouija) you have the means to do so if you wish.&quot;
