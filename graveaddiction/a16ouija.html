On July 30, 2006 I received an e-mail from Tim about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hello, my name is Tim, and this is an experience that my friends and I had with a ouija board last night.
<br><br>
I was online, browsing around and whatnot, and my friend Christine instant messaged me. She asked me if I wanted to go and use an ouija board with her, along with our friends Rachel and Noelle. I said sure, and a little while later the three of them came by my house and picked me up.
<br><br>
We drove around for awhile before we went to a cemetery that was up on a little hill. It was pitch-black out, with the exception of the car headlights that occasionally passed, and the board and oracle themselves (the board and oracle glow in the dark). Rachel was the one that was asking questions, and we were in the cemetery for at least 3 hours.  We left at about half past midnight. We had contacted four spirits; the first one we lost, the second one was a 34-year old married man named Bob (who would turn out to be the favorite spirit that we had contacted), a man who was scaring Rachel by saying he was related to her, and a bisexual woman.
<br><br>
At this time, we were hungry, so we went back to Christine's house and had some food. When we were there, we were trying to decide where it was that we should go next to use the board. It was suggested that we try using the board outside of our friends' apartment; their names are Rob and Alex. We went to their apartment, and at this time it was around 1:30 or 2:00 A.M. Setting up the board outside their door, we all concentrated as Rachel began speaking. She asked how many people were present, and the board replied with 6. Since Christine, Rachel, Noelle, and myself totalled four people, we assumed that there were two spirits present, to total the six that the board had responded with. Rachel asked the board a few more questions, before finally asking what the name of the spirit was that we were talking to.
<br><br>
Slowly, the oracle moved to the 6, and stopped for a moment. We exchanged confused glances, but didn't take our fingertips off the oracle. It then started moving again-- it went upwards a little, and then looped back down toward the 6 again. Rachel stared at the board and said, &quot;If that thing fucking moves to the six again, I'm done. I'm just quitting.&quot; It was maybe five seconds later that the board moved again. It went up, and looped back around to the 6 for the third time. Rachel covered her mouth with one of her hands and just stared at the oracle in complete disbelief. We said goodbye to the spirit, and tried to contact a different one.
<br><br>
Rachel asked the new spirit what its name was, and the oracle moved toward the 6 again. Rachel's mouth opened a bit, and the oracle made a repeat performance, spelling out 666 again. We said goodbye again, and were trying to get over what we had seen.
<br><br>
&quot;Dude,&quot; Christine said, &quot;they've got el diablo living at their door! They need to move, NOW!&quot; Rachel and I kind of laughed at that, still a bit shaken up, and Noelle seemed quiet, as if trying to take it all in. Rachel was leaning up against the door into their apartment, and I felt my mouth fall open an inch or two as I stared at it.
&quot;What is it, Tim?&quot; she asked.
I pointed at the number on Rob and Alex's door. &quot;They live in apartment 16. It came up as saying 666 TWICE when we were doing it here. It never said that even at the cemetery.&quot;
<br><br>
We left, trying to put that experience behind us. &quot;They really need to move,&quot; Christine said again.
