On September 2, 2007 I received an e-mail from Mike K. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me and two other friends decided to try using the ouija board in our friend's garage. We didn't think it would work because it was so early and daytime, but we were pleasantly surprised.
<br><br>
Mike: Are there any spirits who would like to contact us through the Ouija board?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: Can you please tell us your name?<br>
Board: Brad<br>
<br>
Mike: How old were you when you died, Brad?<br>
Brad: 23<br>
<br>
Mike: How did you die?<br>
Brad: Shot<br>
<br>
Mike: Were you murdered?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: What year did you die?<br>
Brad: 1923<br>
<br>
Then we asked it some test questions about us...<br>
<br>
Mike: I’m thinking of a band right now, can you please tell us the letter that this band's name starts with?<br>
Brad: W (I was thinking of Wolfmother)<br>
<br>
Mike: Are you the spirit that we talked to last night?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Onto the questions...<br>
<br>
Clayton: Was there a person who died in my basement who starved themselves to death?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Clayton: Does he haunt my house?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Clayton: So he moved on?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Mike: How many spirits haunt Clayton's house?<br>
Brad: 16<br>
<br>
Mike: Brad, we heard a loud bang on the garage door when we were here trying this Friday, was it a spirit that we were talking to?<br>
Brad: A mad 1<br>
<br>
Mike: Was he mad that we blew out the candle?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
We asked him if our friend was a square, we often call him this because of how uptight he is.  Here's what happened...<br>
<br>
Chris: Is Charlie a square?<br>
Brad: A big one.<br>
<br>
(Laughter)<br>
<br>
Chris: Brad, were you a comedian?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: Were you famous?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Chris: Does John's mom hate me?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Chris: Dislike me?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Clayton: Do I love Chris?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: Do you like us?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: We like you, you're funny.<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Clayton: I've been having dreams lately, do you know anything about them?<br>
Brad: Me<br>
<br>
Mike: Were you causing the dreams?<br>
Brad: (Moves between yes and no)<br>
<br>
Mike: Maybe?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Brad: I'll stop.<br>
Clayton: Thank you.<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: Would it be a good idea to put &quot;You're welcome&quot; on the Ouija board?<br>
Brad: Don't<br>
<br>
Mike: Would it be unsafe?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
(We hear clatter at the garage door, Clayton checks it out)<br>
<br>
Mike: Was that you?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: Did you do that for your own amusement at seeing us scared?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: You’re funny.<br>
Brad: LOL (we all laughed that he actually said lol)<br>
<br>
Brad: cj<br>
Mike: Are you talking about Clayton? (Those are his initials)<br>
<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
Chris: Do you want to ask him a question?<br>
<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
Mike: Ask away, Brad.<br>
<br>
Brad: Why does bj (his brother) hurt you?<br>
Clayton: Because he's a jock.<br>
<br>
Brad: ok<br>
<br>
Mike: Did you live in this house?<br>
Brad: No<br>
<br>
Mike: This general area? (Our city?)<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: Were you killed in Clayton's house?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Mike: Do you stick around this house with the other spirits?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: Is the afterlife good?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: Is it kind of like our world, but with other people who have died?<br>
Brad: Yes<br>
<br>
Chris: We're going to end this session now, we appreciate talking to you, Brad.<br>
(Board moves to goodbye)<br>
<br>
When we left his garage, an apple fell from the top of his garage...there is no apple tree from were it fell, we figured that this was Brad fooling with us again.
