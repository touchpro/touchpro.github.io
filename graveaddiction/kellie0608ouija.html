On June 27, 2008 I received an e-mail from Kellie C. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Three days ago, me and eight friends created our own ouija board. We decided to do this because most of us have never done one before, and our friend's dad Steve does it a lot, to keep in contact with his wife.  At first everything was going smooth, and we were speaking to our friend Kirstine who died and she touched us.
<br><br>
After a while we lost Kirstine, and another spirit came through but wasn't friendly. After we have read your site, we now know we have done everything completely wrong. After Kirstine, this spirit was spelling out three days till you die. And three people had their hands on the glass at the time. Once it spelled this out, we asked who is going to die, and it said Killer. My friend Sam asked, &quot;Killer who?&quot; And it replied you. So Sam asked, &quot;Who, me?&quot; and it said back, &quot;Yes, you&quot;. Then it continued, &quot;3 days death Sam, Kill Rob, and Sophie die.&quot;
<br><br>
After this, Sam replied by asking,  &quot;Who is this?&quot;  It spelled the devil, and kept repeating the word death a few times. Sam replied and said, &quot;How do we die?&quot; and it said you will find out.  Then we told the spirit that it was lying, and it kept forcefully moving to no over and over. So after this, the three of them took their hands off since everyone was getting scared.  Steve was having heart burn in his chest, Danielle was feeling sick, and I had a hot flush. We stopped for a minute to try and get the spirit to leave. I then went to the toilet and said to Danielle to wait outside the door for me, as I was so scared, and I noticed that the tap was switched on a bit. So I assumed someone left it switched on. So I switched it off.
<br><br>
We then went back to the ouija board.  I decided to place my finger on the glass, and the first thing it spelled out was tap.  Sam replied by asking the spirit if it switched it on, and it replied yes. That's when I took my finger off and just watched after that. It then repeated three days till death.  Then Steve went to create a cross, and brought it on the ouija board.  Steve asked if the spirit saw this cross, and asked if it could touch it.  It replied yes, then tried pushing it off the table. Then it was spinning really quick, and Sam and Sophie where trying to keep their hands on the glass. Also, Steve was saying, &quot;Do you love god, because we do and if you don't, then we don't want you here.&quot; It kept going really fast to no over and over, and saying things like fuck you, I hate you.  We started the Our Father prayer, and the planchette was spinning all over the board. Then it stopped and flew into the T.V. and smashed.
<br><br>
After this we left it and opened the glass to get rid of the spirit. We were all very creeped out, and said we would try it later.
When we tried later, we asked if there anyone there and it kept going towards three days.  Then another spirit came through and said his name was Jamie Keo.  He wanted our help to find his father whose name was Martin Keo.  He told us how he died, and the address he lived at.  This address was 52 Ashley Drive, High Wycombe, which he lived at with his nan. His mom and dad lived at 58 Ashley Drive, High Wycombe. This is where my friend's Auntie and Uncle live at this moment in time. He was saying he's scared of his dad, and said his dad killed his mom in the front bedroom by raping her. Then Martin brought Jamie around and raped his son in the same bedroom where his mom was killed, and was still there at the time. After Martin raped Jamie, he gagged and cut his throat and wrists, then chopped them up and placed them in Woodcock Lanes, somewhere in the woods. Jamie was 15, and this was 15 years ago this happened. He told people that his wife and son left them and moved away.
<br><br>
We know that there was a Martin who lived at this address before, but we haven't found any additional information.
<br><br>
The information summarized:<br><br>
Jamie Keo.<br>
Raped at age 15.<br>
He is now 30.<br>
Dad 42 years of age when he commited murder.<br>
Dad is roughly 67 now.<br>
Jamie and mother were both raped and killed.<br>
Jamie was gagged, and wrists and throat were slit.<br>
Mom and boy both died in main bedroom.<br>
Jamie and mother chopped up and buried somewhere in Cocklane Woods.<br>
This happened during 1993.<br>
Dad said to family members that the mom and Jamie had left him.<br>
Jamie lived at 52 Ashley Drive with his nan.<br>
Mom and dad lived at 58 Ashley Drive.<br>
Dad grabbed Jamie when he was alone and brought him to the house 58.<br>
Showed Jamie his dead mom, and said you're next Jay.<br>
Then murdered him.<br>
<br>
We do not know whether this spirit was telling the truth, but he was very confident and wanted to tell someone.  We weren't sure whether to believe this because of the other spirit before, as it could have been playing tricks to get us to believe it. But we aren't sure what to believe.
<br><br>
The next day, Sam and Sophie went on the ouija board to see if Jamie Keo was there.  But before they said anything, it spelled out two days left.  Today is the last day of the three days that the spirit said.  Now everyone is really worried about what will happen.  We're all between 15-18, and Steve is 40.  All we wanted to do was try it out.  We're not mad people, we just didn't believe it until we saw it.
