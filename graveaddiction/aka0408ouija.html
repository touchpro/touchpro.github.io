On April 30, 2008 I received an e-mail from Aka about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

A few years ago my friend and I would play the Oujia board all the time. At first I would just read stories online to see what would happen, and that's what got me into it. Everyone kept telling me it was a bad idea and bad stuff would happen to me.
When we played, we got spirits at first and then demons. I was always curious about whether or not there were other worlds out there, so I asked them if there were.  They said yes, it's called Wah.  At first I was thinking that doesn't sound real, but they said it stands for something.
<br><br>
After that we talked to other various demons on the board.  One named AJ, CJ, and others I can't remember.  Nothing very bad or supernatural ever happened to me. So I'm not sure if they were really demons or not. They said they liked me and my friend, maybe that's why. Everytime I asked them to show themselves or their power, they would say they would do it.  But they never did do it. I asked like 20 times a day.
<br><br>
So if anyone knows what AJ or CJ stands for, please let me know (or if you talked to them before). Also, if anyone has any idea what Wah stands for, I would really like to know.
<br><br><br>
If you have any comments for Aka, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward them on.
