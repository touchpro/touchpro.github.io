On April 26, 2005 I received an e-mail from Jackson Davies regarding his extremely interesting experience with the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Here in the UK, there's a TV show 'Magician' in the vein of David Blaine, who is called Derren Brown. On one show, he performed a live ouija board session, which I and a few friends played along with after making a board out of some cardboard with a shot glass as the planchette. Interestingly, the show was performed from a very skeptical viewpoint, with the participants (on TV that is) being shown a series of photographs of students who died in the building where they were conducting the session. The show ended with the revelation that there were never any such deaths, and the 'spirit' they contacted was revealed to be an actress who came in at the end. As a post-script, most of Derren Browns shows involve him admitting they are not magic, but psychological tricks. He even reveals how some of them are done.
<br><br> 
Anyhow, we continued playing with the board after the show had ended. I don't recall a lot of what was said (I'm a little scared of it, to be honest) but I remember that after asking &quot;is there anybody here?&quot; it went to yes, and when we asked who it just went to the letter U over and over, when I was using it. It didn't work with anyone else. A short time later, we were watching a DVD, when I suddenly felt a great heat on my right thigh. I looked down and there was a small flame on my leg that didn't go out when I slapped it, so I jumped out of my seat and slapped my leg where it had been burning. The flame had burnt a roundish hole through my jeans and my boxers, which was weird. To answer some possible questions, yes I am a smoker, but there were no candles, lighters, matches or cigarettes near me when this happened.&quot;
