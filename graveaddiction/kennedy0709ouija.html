On July 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kennedy about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So me (Kennedy) and my sister (Alex) were playing Ouija board last night.  The ghost we were talking to gave us a message. This is how it goes.  Now it won't be exactly word for word, but I will get it as close as I can.<br>
<br>
Us: Are there any spirits who wish to speak with us?<br>
Spirit: yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Spirit: Sarah Roy<br>
<br>
Us: Are you related to Anik? (Dad's girlfriend)<br>
Sarah: yes<br>
<br>
Us: OK. Sarah, do you mind if we ask how you passed on?<br>
Sarah: No<br>
<br>
Us: OK, how did you die?<br>
Sarah: Fire.<br>
<br>
Us: How old were you?<br>
Sarah: 26<br>
<br>
Us: What year did you die?<br>
Sarah: 1976<br>
<br>
Us: Sarah, are the candles bothering you?<br>
Sarah: no<br>
<br>
Us: OK. Did you have any kids?<br>
Sarah: yes<br>
<br>
Us: How many?<br>
Sarah: 2<br>
<br>
Us: Did you have a son and a daughter?<br>
Sarah: No<br>
<br>
Us: Did you have 2 daughters?<br>
Sarah: yes<br>
<br>
Us: How old were they?<br>
Sarah: 4, 3<br>
<br>
Us: Four and three?<br>
Sarah: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What were their names?<br>
Sarah: Averel and Penelope<br>
<br>
Us: Are they still alive?<br>
Sarah: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Sarah, do you have a message for one of us?<br>
Sarah: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Who?<br>
Sarah: Kennedy<br>
<br>
Us: OK, what's your message?<br>
Sarah: Turn off the clock at 9:52<br>
<br>
Us: PM?<br>
Sarah: Yes<br>
<br>
(I looked at the clock, and it was 9:46 PM)<br>
<br>
Us: Which one?<br>
Sarah: Bedroom<br>
<br>
(we were in the bedroom)<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Sarah: evil<br>
<br>
Us: What kind of evil?<br>
Sarah: Trapped<br>
<br>
Me: Do I just get trapped?<br>
Sarah: No<br>
<br>
Us: The both of us?<br>
Sarah: yes<br>
<br>
Us: Should we stop playing at a certain time?<br>
Sarah: 9:52<br>
<br>
At 9:52, I unplugged the clock.  As soon as I put my hands back on the planchette, it quickly moved to goodbye.<br>
<br>
In the morning, we told Anik about it.  She said that the candle that was on top of the clock had leaked its wax all over, and was about to burn down all of the wax. She informed us that we could have started a fire if it had kept burning any longer.  We were playing by candle light, and Sarah knew that if we were to stop playing, we would blow out the candles. She saved us from possibly dying the way she did.
