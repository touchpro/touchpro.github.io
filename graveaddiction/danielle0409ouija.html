On April 21, 2009 I received an e-mail from Danielle R. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This happened to my friend and I from the time we were 15-ish until we were 18. It went on for a long time...we started out on the ouija board one night when we were bored. I was staying at Vanessa's house, and somehow we came across it. We spoke to a spirit named Rusty for quite sometime. Vanessa was really good at deciphering what they spelled, but I wish we would have recorded it all now.  Anywoo, we talked to him for a few weeks; every weekend we'd get together and hang out at one of our houses, and at night we'd talk to Rusty. He introduced us to others, one in particular I took a liking to, his name was Bob. Roberto Benjamin Martinez. I still remember his bithdate: March 2, 1850, born in Illinois. He said we were soulmates. He always told me he loved me. It was...so weird.  Anyway, I would tell him that too eventually. He would always say he followed me everywhere. They were all part of a gang called the Titans, and they would talk about their jobs.  They were strippers, and some were gay. There were 19 names we had at one time. I'm leaving out interesting details, but this took place over almost 4 years, so theres A LOT to cover...if ya want to know more, email me!
<br><br>
Anywoo, we were always getting stoned and talking on this thing. We'd tell it good night, go to bed, and wake up and talk to it in the morning. They supposedly followed us just about everywhere. One even mentioned it didn't like that I told someone at school about him and his real name, it was weird. I was obsessed, to say the least. I actaully was thinking of this thing as my boyfriend.
<br><br>
Well anyway, one night I had an actual boyfriend, and he had given me and Vanessa acid.  We got home and decided to talk to Bob, because he was really all I thought about. We had even made a blueprint of his house, with his instructions. It would scoot stuff around the board and table with the viewer, we would draw all over the board with marker, it would totally interact with us. Anyway, on with the main idea, we were tripping and decided to talk to them. They told us to smoke a joint when we asked what to do. The next thing I remember (we had been sitting each on a bed, with a table in between us), we were at the end of my bed, forming a triangle. I remember it being all black, then i saw a temple, like a Mayan pyramid, and a fire. I heard chanting, but I'm not sure what...I remember getting closer, and then all of a sudden, I jerked &quot;awake&quot; and said, no this is bad, we're not supposed to do this...this is bad.  I shook Vanessa, and she had like Indian war paint all over her, it was nuts.  I spent the rest of that night fighting to not drift asleep, because everytime I did, I would see and hear the same things and it scared the shit out of me. Also, I had a bunch of gerbils and hissing cockroaches in 10 gallon tanks, and ALL of them were huddled in the corner of their tanks, the same corner, and formed a perfect triangle. Everything was making a triangle. Everything appeared to be put in a triangle shape.
<br><br>
I ended up throwing the board out the house. Finally morning came, and it stopped. I couldn't sleep well for a long time. Obviously. Finally though, I missed Bob, and I wanted to know what happened. We got the board back out, and asked if anyone was there. They were. But Bob wasn't. Something had happened to him. He was hurt. We asked them what happened that night, why they tried to hurt us, and they said it wasn't them.  It was some thing, a powerful demon (I can't remember if there was a name). They had vaguely mentioned over the years about &quot;something bad&quot; that didn't want them talking to us, and they were only allowed to tell us so much about our futures and stuff. So I guess this thing tried to possess us???? I don't know, but all I know was that I felt haunted for a long ass time, and still wonder to this day if everything they said was true - about where they were, how they &quot;lived,&quot; that I was Bob's soulmate and would be with him one day as long I believed or something...but we had lots of times when it would make figure 8's, and go through the alphabet, and repeat shit, mostly I love you I love you I love you. But we never felt threatened until that night, and even that wasn't enough to keep us away for long.  I've been searching everywhere, hoping I'd run into someone with a similar experience or maybe recognize names. They said they were in a gang called the Titans, like the Greek or Roman god stuff. And they all had nicknames, like Poseidon, Aries, Zeus, and so on.
