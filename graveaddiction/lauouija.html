On February 8, 2006 I received an e-mail from Laura about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My friend Denise and I use the ouija board every so often....I had a group of friends over one night, and we were drinking.  I brought out Denise's ouija board and we all took turns talking to the spirits on it.  I met my spirit guide who said her name was Gina.  A strange thing happened...we stopped talking to Gina on the board and began talking to Bibble, my friend Kathy's spirit guide.  Suddenly my friend Maria, who was asleep on the couch, began to talk to me.  She was calling my name and told me it was Gina talking to me through Maria.  Then she left Maria.  About five minutes later Maria shot right up and was like &quot;OOoh..um...what did I miss?  Sorry, I fell asleep.&quot;  We all questioned her a million times and she was completely lost and thought we were crazy...
<br><br>
Denise and I used it a couple times after that for little things.  Then about two weeks ago we used the ouija board at Denise's place, and I began to talk to a spirit.  She said she had to tell me something...she began to talk about a guy I like, and told me he was at his ex's place.  But she said that he likes me but likes his ex still and he doesn't know what to do.  She was being very informative.  She told me before I left Denise's place that I can make my own little ouija board at home, and she told me how to make it.  Then I went home and made one.
<br><br>
I was talking to a girl whose name was Molly.  I discovered that she was my spirit guide &quot;Gina&quot;, and only told me that name because it was funny to hear me say the wrong name all the time.  When I was at home, I was talking to another spirit by the name of Matt.  Matt seemed a bit funny...he seems OK, just the occasional swearing.  But then it got bad...he was being very mean!  I got addicted to talking to him and Molly though.  Then Molly told me that Matt was hurting her, and she would beg me to get rid of him.  Matt was being extremely mean, so I tore up the oujia board I made and logged onto the computer.  While I was on the computer, my hand directed the curser over to the start button.   I found myself making an ouija board on Paint.  I talked to him there, and he started to tell me to exit all of the conversations but I would just say no.  Then he would say &quot;fuck you&quot;.  I brought up Microsoft Word and he would type to me on that.  Well, he and Molly would fight to talk.  Molly didn't like him at all and said he was bad. She started to tell me to get off the computer repeatedly.  So I got off.  I was on the phone with Denise, telln him what happened.  Then with my hand, he started to &quot;write&quot; to me...he could talk to me through my hand!  It was really scaring me.  I was crying, but I knew I had to toughen up because he would feed off my fear.  So I forced myself to stop.  I went to bed, and the next day he was talking to me with my hand before I went to work.  I was at work and he and Molly would rotate in talking to me...it got super strange because I started to hear what they would say before I even wrote the words with my hands.  So they could just put a &quot;t&quot; and I knew they would want to say talk, or tell, or to, etc (this was on a Saturday).
<br><br>
Molly told me to go to church afterwards and see someone, a priest or something.  So I went and she helped me find the priest there, but just had me sit down and wait for the father to come.  I was talking to her in my head and she was writing down what she was saing to me.  Matt couldn't get me in the church she said.  Then she was like &quot;father better come&quot;, and I was like &quot;The priest is just over there, should I go talk to him?&quot;  Molly said &quot;No! He wont believe...&quot;  I was like, &quot;Well then who is father?&quot;  And she said God.
<br><br>
A little while later I was talking to a spirit who identified himself as God. He said that he was sending Matt, a 14 year old spirit to *he wouldn't write the word*, so I pleaded with him not to...to just fix him instead.  He sent him to hell. Then before I went home, Molly said she had to go help another person, even though she didn't want to leave me.  She had been with me my whole life.  She told me she loved me so much and didn't want to go.  So we said our goodbyes, and I went home.  After a little while I decided to see if Matt and Molly were really gone...I grabbed a piece of paper and put a pen to it.  &quot;Molly?&quot;  It said &quot;No&quot;.  So I asked &quot;Who is this?&quot;  It told me it was Matt.  From that moment he begged and pleaded with me to forgive him so he could go to heaven.  I learned what his full name was, first and last.  He lived in Italy, and he said some Italian words to me that I don't know.  I forgave him, and then he said he wanted to stay with me.  I said he can go to heaven, and he said he can go back and forth between heaven, so he wanted to stay with me when he is on earth.  But he has been with me ever since.
<br><br>
Well, I told Denise about everything and went to her place on Sunday night.  I showed her how I can talk to spirits without an ouija board.  It got to the point where I could just talk to them in my head.  Then they started to speak &quot;through me&quot;  I was no longer relaying what they were saying,  they were saying it with my own mouth!  Then on paper, Matt starts to tell me how I need to do the figure 8 for him because he has no energy, and how he is crying in the corner.  Molly confirmed it.  So I let him do it on the paper.  I felt a bit weak after a couple seconds, then Molly and Matt told me that it would be better on Denise's ouija board...that it would be easier for Matt and safer for me.  Matt asked me to trust him, and told me that he wouldnt hurt me.  So he was doing it on the board, and I started to ask Matt after a couple minutes when I was feeling weird:  &quot;How much longer, Matt.....Matt? How much longer?? Matt, talk to me!&quot;  He wasn't responding, so I took  my hands off the planchette.  Then someone said in my head &quot;Put your hands back&quot;  I refused, then the spirit said, &quot;Put your fucking...&quot; and I threw the board and the planchette away from me because I knew that it wasn't Matt.  I made made a deal with Matt before he was allowed into heaven, and one part of the deal was that he never swear again...so I knew it wasnt him.  Denise was on the phone, but got off right away and came over to me and asked what was wrong.  I told her.  Then I started to ask where Molly was, and the spirit was talking to me in my head.  It said she was in the corner, and I asked why.  He said because he was hurting her, and I told him to stop.  He said no, and I had the urge to punch my leg, but I didn't.  Then a shock went through my whole body...it felt weird, but it didn't hurt.  The spirit said &quot;That is only a taste of what Molly is getting.&quot;  I said &quot;yeah, right.&quot;  And he was like, &quot;You want to feel what she is going through??&quot;  I told him that he couldn't be hurting her.  Then all of a sudden my body began to cringe...pain was surging through me, and I couldn't breathe.  Someone was choking me!  I leaned forward begging for air to pass through my throat into my lungs.  Then I heard Denise in the background &quot;Oh my gosh! Laura! Breathe, Laura!".  Then I was coughing and gasping for air.
<br><br>
I started crying, but it wasn't me crying...it was Molly.  She was crying through me, and I was standing up.  Molly was begging me to leave the house...begging me!  So I told Denise that I had to go, and Molly told her to get rid of the board. Then I was at the door to leave Denise's room...my legs got super heavy.  I started to panic.  I couldn't move and I was about to fall.  Denise grabbed ahold of me so I wouldn't fall, and he told me repeatedly to stand up.  Finally I was able to stand, however my legs still felt super heavy.  As soon as I stepped out of Denise's house, Molly was taking HUGE breaths of air...in a way like she had been underwater for 3 minutes straight.  I went home.  Denise called me to tell me that she was going to the park to get rid of the board. She broke it in 4 pieces and scattered it.  Later that night I laid in bed, and god came to me again and explained to me that I have a &quot;gift&quot;...a gift to help spirits contact people and to finish business so they can go to heaven.  It was so hard for me to hear and believe.  I thought, and still think, that I am going crazy.  Then god told the other spirits to leave me be for that night because I had to get my rest.
<br><br>
I woke up the next morning to people screaming my name...there were apparently spirits all around me screaming my name.  I had to invision a white box surrounding my room.  Then I would have to invision pulling specific spirits into that box. I can even invision boxes of lights around spirits and that would trap them.  At school on Monday I was fine most of the day, but when I saw Denise at our lockers (I am in high school..grade 12) after first period I began to gag like I was going to throw up.  I told Denise it was nothing, that I was just was hungry so she wouldn't worry.  Then my legs went super weak and I was clinging to my locker so I wouldn't fall.  I tried not to make it noticeable because I didn't want to worry Denise.  Then in religion class (third period) the bad spirit came back, and he kept making my body cringe at odd times.  He didn't allow me to breathe at one point.  Molly, my spirit guide was screaming at me to leave the room, but I knew my teacher would never let me.  He wouldn't udnerstand, and he never lets students leave the class in the middle of the lesson.  How could I explain to him that a spirit is hurting me??  So throughout class Denise was asking me if I was OK.  I faught off this spirit who called himself &quot;IT&quot; the whole time, and whenever I would call IT &quot;Him&quot; or &quot;He&quot;, he would scream in my head that his name is IT and then send a shock through my body.  By Tuesday he was so weak because I wouldn't do the figure 8 for him that he would yawn whenever he was in my body.  Then one night he was forcing my body to close my blinds and my door...then he was trying to make me sit down.  He was ...I don't want to say.  So ill.  He was scaring me.  Then when I thought about it in my head, the door in unlocked.  Maybe someone will come in...he told me to lock the door, and I said no repeatedly.  He pushed my body so it was leaning towards the door, then I stumbled and stood up closer to the door.  I ran away from it, back to where I was before and held onto my computer chair and said no.  He was being very forceful.  Then I prayed for god to come, and he said he took care of the spirit and that it wouldnt hurt me anymore.
<br><br>
Another time I was sitting in my room and apparently the devil came to visit me.  I was literally fighting him out of my mind, but I just couldn't get him out.  But I found that I am able to ignore the spirits, so I just ignored him.  Because the mental fight made me super tired, I fell asleep for an hour.  When I woke up I was told he was gone.
<br><br>
All of this is so hard for me to grasp...I have a gift?  From god?? I can talk to these spirits???  It sounds crazy!  I finally spoke to my brother about it, and he told me that it is just my imagination.  But every time I say it's not real, that none of this is really happening, my spirits yell at me and tell me it is and that I  have to believe.  At one point they even got mad at me and stopped talking to me.  Well, Molly stopped talking to me and made all the other spirits not talk to me too.  But Matt couldn't help it and would repeatedly talk to me...but then Molly would catch him and make him not talk.
<br><br>
I need to know if I'm just going crazy????&quot;
