On July 20, 2007 I received an e-mail from Damien about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have an old board that I bought from an antique shop. I am, or rather was, a skeptic. Just for laughs, I've pulled it out in the past, and after reading your page have found I have usually done all the wrong things, but sometimes gotten results. We usually do it under the influence, usually get bored and try calling demons, Hitler, and any other bad buggers we can think of.  Usually nothing ever happens...usually.
<br><br>
Anyways, the last time I had a crack at it was last Saturday night with two friends.  I don't have a planchette, so I usually break the bottom of a wine bottle and we use that instead. Sometimes we had random movement, sometimes it just went to goodbye or ran off the board, but we didn't get anything concrete.  The most dramatic time was a few years ago, when we got a guy who called himself Rob Athune.  He said that he died at 28 in a car crash.  He also said that he wasn't in a good place, and when asked if he had anything to tell us, he spelled out &quot;be careful.&quot;  When my friend Erin asked who had to be careful, it quickly spelled out NIRE which we didn't get until Erin went white and didn't want to play anymore...it was her name spelled backwards. Until this happened, we had been in contact on and off with him for 5 hours. Each of us (3) thought the other was tricking, and we each took it in turn, making the other 2 put their fingers on ours to prove we were not moving it. Rob kept going to goodbye, and we kept on hassaling him back for more until the Erin/NIRE thing happened and then we finished. I said nobody will ever believe this, then we went to bed.
<br><br>
The next day I was telling my partner, who was asleep when it happened, all about it and she said, &quot;I know, I was half asleep/half awake and felt something in the room. I saw a dark shape at the foot of the bed and wanted to scream, but felt paralyzed.  Then I heard you say no one will ever believe this, and I fell back to sleep.&quot; Freaky, huh?
<br><br>
The next day an elderly couple (who had just won tattslotto and were planning a trip overseas) who live up the road were hit by a man in a car on a straight section of road in broad daylight!  The man had no recollection of how it happened since he blacked out and came to on the wrong side of the road at a rail crossing.  It was a stone's throw from my place, but his first name was Robert, and the surname of the couple killed was Athune. I didn't touch the board again until last Saturday night.
