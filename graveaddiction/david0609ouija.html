On June 26, 2009 I received an e-mail from David N. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This was my first experience with an Ouija board. Keep in mind that we did not record this conversation. I'm recalling it to the best of my knowledge.
<br><br>
The three people involved were Me (David), Clare, and Melinda.
<br><br>
After Clare and Melinda praying to god, and me praying to good spirits (I don't believe in religion. DON'T SEND ME HATE MAIL :P) We decided to get underway. After talking to a few spirits that were not interested in talking, we got a good one that had a lot of useful information...
<br><br>
------------
<br><br>
Melinda: Are there any spirits present?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Melinda: Can we ask you questions about yourself?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: Can we ask you questions about ourselves?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Melinda: When is my birthday?<br>
Board: puts in the numbers for Melinda's birthday (I don't remember Melinda's birthday. Sorry, baby girl :P)<br>
<br>
Me: Well...Just to prove to myself you guys arent pushing it, I gotta ask it a question only I would know.<br>
planchette moves in circles on board<br>
Clare: Hurry up. That means ask a question.<br>
<br>
Me: When's my sister Jessica's birthday?<br>
Board: 418<br>
<br>
Clare: April 18th?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: ...No<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know my sisters birthday?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Melinda: Who am I having...&quot;relations&quot; with tomorrow?<br>
Board: J-O-R...<br>
<br>
I blurt out the person because I didn't know this, neither did Clare.<br>
Me: JORDAN!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ha ha. The board knows who Melinda fornicates with.<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Who else does Melinda do that with?<br>
Board: T.G.<br>
<br>
Me: T.G.?<br>
Melinda: Tyler.<br>
Me: You little horny girl!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
I laugh at the boards response.<br>
<br>
Clare: Should Melinda stop having relations with Tyler?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Clare: Why?<br>
Board: Prgn<br>
<br>
Me: Pregnant?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Melinda looks at me in panic.<br>
<br>
Clare: Melinda will get pregnant if she keeps doing what she's doing?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Will she if she keeps doing it with Jordan?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Melinda: But Tyler uses a condom...This doesn't make sense...<br>
Board: Won't<br>
<br>
Melinda: Tyler won't use a condom?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: That sounds like a very strong sign, Melinda. I would stop messing around if I were you.<br>
Clare: I trust whoever is talking to us right now...This is a little too accurate to not be true.<br>
Board: Dng<br>
<br>
Me: Can you spell that again?<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Me: Wait, whats Dng mean?<br>
Board: (nothing moves)<br>
<br>
Me: Hello?<br>
Board: (nothing moves)<br>
<br>
Slid down to goodbye<br>
<br>

We then stood up to notice the HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of ants crawling underneath the board. There were no cracks in the cement where the board was, and we were under a street light. We probably would have seen that many, and that big, of ants to get underneath the board.
<br><br>
And that was my first Ouija board experience. Doing another one tonight with my friends Anthony and Nick. Hopefully we'll get good results :)
