On September 26, 2006 I received an e-mail from Grace G. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This little story is about my Cousin Jr. My cousin and I were close. I loved being around him. He was always the jokester type. I can't remember the exact year he came to live with me and my family. He came to live with us because his mother was worried about  him getting into the gangs and such. He was around, I think, 15 at the time. He was a couple months older than myself. Anyhow, he came to live with us and we started talking about the Ouija Board. I don't remember the conversation verbatim, but I remember him telling me that he and bunch of his friends were messing around with one. He was laughing and telling me how he scared one of the girls that was with them while they were playing with it by rolling his eyes back and acting as if he were possessed. Anyhow, he said he asked it when he would die. I said &quot;Why would you ask it when you would die?&quot; He basically said he just wanted to know...just messing around with it type stuff. I asked him what it told him. It never told him how he would die but when. It told him he would die before be turned 18 years old.  I'm thinking to myself....why the hell would you ever want to know.
<br><br>
Anyhow, a couple months later he had got jumped by some neighborhood kids and got beaten up pretty bad. When the police found him they thought he was damn near dead...he had blood gushing from his head. I went to the hospital and saw him there laying in the hospital bed...his head was wrapped up in that white gauze. And I'm just scared out of my mind for him...but somehow he managed to squeeze out a couple of jokes. He had a great sense of humor. Always had me laughing. My aunt came to Indiana to come get him and take him back home so she could take care of him. He left Indiana with her, headed back home. When he got home, he eventually did get involved with the gang life. He ended up in prison and I spoke with him in Decemeber of that year...I can't remember the exact year. I spoke with him on the phone from his sister's house and we chitchatted. When we got off the phone, I told him I loved him for the first time ever and he told me he loved me back. First for him as well.
<br><br>
At the time, my uncle had come to live with us after Jr. had left. He came to leave the gang life behind. Basically he was on the run from them. So he took our home as refuge, just as my cousin had. The next month, in January...my cousin had gotten released from prison. Went back to doing what he was doing before...went back to hang with his &quot;homeboys.&quot;
<br><br>
That particular year we didn't have a phone. So we had no way of anyone contacting us from our hometown.
<br><br>
January 18th, a police officer came to our home and informed us that we had to get in contact with our family back in our hometown.
My uncle ran down to the pay phone 2 blocks away and made a call back home. He came back and the first words out of his mouth were &quot;Jr's dead.&quot;  That's all I could hear, and tears just started rolling down my cheeks...as they are now that I'm writing this.  I just sat there amazed at what I heard, but had totally forgotten what he told me years earlier.
<br><br>
That night I was just skimming through a magazine and remembered what he told me about what the Ouija board told him. That he would die before he was 18...and I just got scared ...freaked out. My cousin died 3 days before his 18th birthday.
<br><br>
I never told my aunt what he said...she was so grief stricken that I just left it alone, but I've never forgotten.
<br><br>
For those of you who think this is all fun and games...it's not...its very real. Very Real.
