On October 30, 2006 I received an e-mail from Maria Judy about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Since I was about 12 years old, my friends and cousins and I have been avid ouija board users, using my grandmothers board from the 1920's. This particular story happened to my friend Whitney and I when we were about 13 years old (we are now 19).
<br><br>
One day, Whitney and I (Maria) were at my home all alone.  We decided to get out the board and use it. We were upstairs in my rec room, sitting on the floor. We started off by asking it the usual questions any 13 year old would ask, like what boy likes me and other questions of that sort. Well, after a while, Whitney and I decided to ask it forbidden questions (like ones about God) just to see what would happen. Now I do not recollect EXACTLY what we had asked it. But after a few questions the planchette zoomed off the board, flying a good 3 feet away from it. That really scared us, so we jumped up, tossed the board farther away from the planchette and ran downstairs (note: the planchette and board were nowhere near each other in the room). After calming down, we wanted to go back and play some more, and close our session. When we got back up to the room, the board and planchette were sitting in the direct center of the room, neatly on top of each other! Not one person was home with us that day!!  Whitney and I got pretty freaked out, so we decided to not play with the board for the rest of the day.  That was one pretty freaky experience for two 13 year old girls!
