On March 27, 2008 I received an e-mail from Steph Clark about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
The one that will always stand out in my head was when a bunch of my school friends and I did a ouija.
<br><br>
We were 9 years old, and given none of us really knew what a Ouija board was but we understood its concept. Me and some girls called Helen, Elaine, Brigette, Rachel and Shelly had heard stories from the older kids at school, so we decided to make a 'fake' one, doing the letters of the alphabet and the numbers. We didn't know you had to have YES, NO and GOODBYE also. It was really hot, sometime just before school let out for summer, so we sat on the ground outside, there was a bit of a breeze, so we had to sellotape our letters and numbers to a large piece of wood from a skip to prevent them from blowing away!!
<br><br>
Elaine began by asking if there was anybody there. I can only presume as there was no option for spirit to move to yes, the glass started to circle. I thought it was my friends playing about so I had a tantrum (as 9 year old kids do) and said I wasn't going to 'play' anymore unless they stopped messing about. They promised me they weren't, and continued.
<br><br>
As time went by, we got a load of mumbo jumbo. Then Shelly asked the spirit to tell us something that would happen. The glass stopped, and moved to E. X. P. L. O. S. I. O. N. G. A. S really fast.
<br><br>
We got bored, and stopped as the board would give us nothing else after that. So we continued to play hopskotch and the like.
<br><br>
The next morning, the house that we were sitting opposite of (well, maisonette) had a gas explosion. The woman that lived there was hurt, and it was also on the news.
<br><br>
Bear in mind that we were 9. Tell me what 9 year old could spell out Explosion Gas without some difficulty.
