On September 28, 2005 I received an e-mail from Rebecca Moses about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Last night I was talking to one of my friends in the hall when we heard girls screaming, so of course we ran to the room.
<br><br>
When we got there, they were playing with an ouija board (something I'm scared to death of). I didn't know any of the girls, but they invited us to sit in and watch. Well, we watched while they asked silly questions but then they decided to ask who all in the room was in touch with the spirits. The first name was &quot;AMY&quot; (the board ALWAYS spells out Amy) the second was &quot;JAYLA&quot; and the third was &quot;BECCA&quot;. The girls started looking around asking &quot;Who's Becca?&quot;, and  you might have guessed that was me. Right then and there I started to believe in the thing, because I didnt know any of the girls there, and they didn't know me.
<br><br>
There were other times where the board spelled out &quot;mama&quot; over and over again, and we later found out that the person talking to us was a 10 year old boy named Zac who died in 1937 in Arizona. His mother had killed him.  
<br><br>
Amy's boyfriend was in the room, and the board kept saying &quot;quit touch amy.&quot;   We then asked if he would hurt the boyfriend and the board replied yes. When we asked him why he didn't like her boyfriend, all the board would say was &quot;zac amy, zac amy&quot;.
<br><br>
The funny thing is that when her boyfriend would play on it, the cursor thing would start going around rapidly in circles or spelling the same word over and over again.  All the boyfriend had to say was &quot;zac calm down&quot; or &quot;stop zac&quot;. He was the only person the board would listen to.
<br><br>
The girl also told us previous stories about playing with her board in a graveyard and it spelling run and talking to other people through it.
<br><br>
I never touched the board, I'm scared to death of the things and most likely I am going to try and &quot;cleanse&quot; myself so weird things wont happen to me. However, I'm not saying that I won't sit in on another session again, it was one of the most frightening and interesting things of my life.&quot;
