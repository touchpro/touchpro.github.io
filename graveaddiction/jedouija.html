On May 26, 2007 I received an e-mail from Jed S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Last year through your site, my friend, Darcy, and I, Jed, found out about ouija boards. We decided that we should see if they were real, and we made one using paper as the board and a roll of sticky tape as the planchette. We contacted a couple of spirits thinking that one of us was just joking around.
<br><br>
A couple of days I slept over at Darcy's house and we tried the ouija board out again. We contacted a spirit named Hannah. This is how it went:
<br><br>
Darcy: Are you a boy or girl?<br>
Hannah: Girl<br>
<br>
Darcy: What's your name?<br>
Hannah: Hannah<br>
<br>
Darcy: How did you die?<br>
Hannah: Heart attack<br>
<br>
Darcy: Sorry to hear, how old were you when you died?<br>
Hannah: 52<br>
<br>
And then we said goodbye.
<br><br>
That night I slept over and we fell asleep very late. I woke up again at around 3:00 am and saw that the bathroom light was on. I woke up Darcy and asked him if he had turned it on, and he just said that it was probably his younger brother. Darcy went to turn the light off and I stayed in his room. He came back, but the light was still on.  I asked if it was his brother, and he didn't reply.  I stood up and looked closely at him. His face was white and he looked dazed and was shaking. He grabbed me by the arm and took me to the bathroom. When we got to the bathroom I asked what he was doing.  He pointed into the bathroom and I looked around, but there was nothing there so I turned the light off and there was a pale white woman in a night gown standing behind Darcy.
This got us very worried so we stopped using the ouija board.
<br><br>
This year we decided that it was all a bit of harmless fun so we made a new ouija board and started again. We contacted a few random spirits, and then we asked for Hannah and the random spirit said yes.
<br><br>
Darcy: Is this Hannah?<br>
Hannah: Hi Darcy<br>
<br>
Jed: How do you know Darcy?<br>
Hannah: My house<br>
<br>
This scared us but we wanted to find out more.<br>
<br>
Darcy: Did you go to this school?<br>
Hannah: Yes<br>
<br>
Darcy: What was your job?<br>
Hannah: Teacher<br>
<br>
We had enough, so we started moving the planchette to goodbye. Then it started moving again and spelled out &quot;C U 2NITE DARCY.&quot; Darcy was now hysterical in fright. He was sure the board was telling the truth.
<br><br>
That night he couldn't get to sleep. At about the same time as before, 3:00 AM, he saw the bathroom light turn on.  He went to investigate. He looked around the bathroom and there was nothing there, so he decided that it was just a coincidence and switched off the light and went to bed. As he pulled the covers over him he saw, at the foot of his bed, Hannah standing there smiling. Darcy quickly grabbed for his digital camera and tried turning it on, but it wouldn't.  So he grabbed his disposable camera and snapped a shot.
<br><br>
A week later the pictures had developed, and in the picture that Darcy took of Hannah there was a long white line. This incident has put us off ouija boarding for life.
