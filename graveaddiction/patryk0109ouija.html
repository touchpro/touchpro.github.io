On January 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Patryk R. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

The last time I have EVER played the ouija board was intersting. I went over to my friend's house. We were trying to communicate with different spirits. I decided that maybe we should talk to the deceased Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler.
<br><br>
First, I contacted my spirit guide, Seth, and asked him if he could call forth Hitler. Soon enough, I felt an impending evil overcome me. It was Hiter. I asked him sveral questions, regarding the Third Reich, and so forth. At the middle of my session, my friend decided to leave. I, too,called 30 minutes later quits, because now it was no fun.
<br><br>
This is where the story gets bizarre. The next day, my friend ran up to me, pale-faced. He said, &quot;I saw Hitler.&quot; I kinda believed him,because we were still talking with him. My friend says that when he was walking home, he saw the Fuhrer standing next to a tree. But he started coming towards him. As he did, Hitler vanished. As my friend described next, he was scared s***less, and walked home a little faster. When he was nearing his house, he saw an old car from the 1930s near an auto-shop. But then the car started to ride on its own. That scared my friend REAL bad. He ran home, as he described it to me. I find this very strange.
<br><br>
Later that day, I decided to exchange my Ouija Board for a good DVD movie, because I saw no future use of it. I do want to get a new Ouija board,but I have a cat at home, so it's a hard choice.
