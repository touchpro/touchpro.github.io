On March 7, 2010 I received an e-mail from Aaron and Kyme about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Minutes ago, my friend Aaron and I just finished a Ouija session, and the spirit we contacted was very accurate.
<br><br>
We waited until the board was &quot;warm&quot; before asking if it had any advise for us. Immediately, the planchette pointed to yes. It spelled out &quot;Darul Uloom.&quot; Unsure of what it meant, we turned to google for answers.
<br><br>
The search engine pulled up a page for an Islamic university In Israel. We typed the name of our town in the search bar beside &quot;Darul Uloom.&quot;
<br><br>
The first result was shocking. Only weeks prior to this encounter, we had attempted a seance with our Ouija board in an old rundown building. It was known for being a Prisoner Of War camp, locally known as Camp 30. As we scrolled through the picture of &quot;Darul Uloom; Bowmanville,&quot; we recognized the two as the very same location.
<br><br>
After we confirmed with the Ouija that it meant to spell out &quot;Darul Uloom,&quot; we asked it to expand on the topic. The next word was a little jumbled, but cleary spelled as &quot;danger.&quot;
<br><br>
Our parents always warned us about this place, but it was just our parents. The Ouija specified that it was our doings in the building that made it dangerous, for we had preformed many ill recommended practices, out of  pure stupidity.
<br><br>
We had both thought for sure up until this moment that the place was called &quot;Camp 30,&quot; and neither of us knew it under the title of &quot;Darul Uloom.&quot; The Ouija spirit addressed our friends names perfectly, and predicted them to do things very in character.
<br><br>
It also predicted a future breakup for my relationship in 4 weeks, and we wait to see the outcome and truth behind it's ability to tell the future.
