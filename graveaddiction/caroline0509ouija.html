On May 11, 2009 I received an e-mail from Caroline about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Caroline, and my friend and I have an interesting story about Ouija Boards. For the past couple of days, my friend Alex and I have been actively making and using Ouija boards. All last night, we kept getting a spirit named Fin, and he begun threatening my friend Alex. He liked her, and was definitely evil. He told her that he's killed 6 women, which is why he's in hell. He wanted her to join him in hell, and be with him. He told us that the only way for him to be free is for her to love him. She couldn't do that, and he started getting more and more powerful. By now it was about 3 AM, and that's definitely a bad hour to be using a board. Someone else though, named Fae, kept coming around and protecting us from him because Fin wanted to kill my friend. He was so determined, but Fae kept rescuing us, until she basically kicked us off the board after calling us Stupid Girls. Other spirits had called my friend Alex a Kunt, Bitch, and stupid bitch. They kept talking so badly towards her, but I was safe because I believe in God. Eventually though, we listened to Fae's comments, and tore up the board because Fin ended up possessing it. He wouldn't allow any other spirits to be contacted through that board. After that, we put holy water on it.
<br><br>
Since that, we have been feeling kind of badly about ourselves, and over-dramatizing every situation with a mistake. No matter how minor it was, we felt as though we shouldn't be alive. So today, we made another ouija board. Only difference is that we used it during the day, as opposed to at night. We were ok for a while, and here are a couple of conversations we got from the board:
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Hello.<br>
Board: Hello.<br>
<br>
Us: What do you think of our new board? (We changed it up a bit, and added some things)<br>
Board: It goo- -went to the sun-<br>
<br>
Us: Is it too complicated?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Do you have a message?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: For who?<br>
Board: C-A-R-O-L-I-N-E<br>
C-O-N-N-O<br>
<br>
Us: Does that mean I don't know?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Goodbye.<br>
<br>
After getting one good spirit, we decided to try another one.<br>
<br>
Us: Are there any spirits?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: What sort of spirit are you?<br>
Board: -went to the sun-<br>
<br>
Us: Hello!<br>
Board: Hello.<br>
<br>
Us: Do you have a message?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Do you know your message?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Who is your message for?<br>
Board: A-L-E-X<br>
<br>
Us: What is your message?<br>
Board: M-Y-N-O-P-A<br>
<br>
Us: My nopa?<br>
Board: Maybe.<br>
<br>
Us: What is Nopa?<br>
Board: I don't know.<br>
<br>
Us: Would you like to try again?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
M-Y-N-O-P<br>
Goodbye.<br>
<br>
So we stopped using the board for a couple seconds, we tend to take breaks. When we came back, though, and the person who responded to the board was Fin. Of course, he was a lot less powerful now. He just talked a bit, told us he wanted to be good, then left. After that, we got a spirit named Andy, who was in love with Caroline, and hated Alex for being around. He kept saying, &quot;My Caroline,&quot; &quot;I love Caroline,&quot; &quot;Lovely Caroline,&quot; &quot;Not Alex,&quot; &quot;My Caroline Please,&quot; and kept being persistent with how much he loved Caroline and wanted her to be around him. He wanted Caroline to love him back, and it was kind of creepy, since Caroline is me. Yet flattering at the same time. Eventually he grew to be evil, because he was obsessed with me, and couldn't stand Alex. But I told him that he couldn't hurt Alex, and he got upset because I threatened to not speak to him if he wanted to hurt Alex. He begged me no, and please. He said he needed lovely Caroline, and couldn't do that. That just freaked us out a bit more. We got Fin back after that, then Fae, then Andy again, then Fin, and they all just kept switching.
<br><br>
After using the board so much over the past couple days, we both feel like crap. Like we're not worth anything, and my room is no longer a sanction of comfort for either of us. We've decided to not use the board for a few days, if not longer.
<br><br>
I'm just posting this to warn people, if you want to play with boards, know what you're getting yourself into. It can be a scary place sometimes. Especially because after the night with Fin, I felt odd in the morning, and Alex felt like she had been choked.
<br><br>
Heed the warnings people give you, and if a spirit tells you to leave: TAKE THEIR ADVICE!
