On June 16, 2008 I received an e-mail from Joe V. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I don't remember what age I was, but I was either in third or fourth grade because my dad was still living with us. My mom bought a ouija board. I heard of it, but didn't really think to much of it.  I was just a kid, I never thought anything was a big deal.
<br><br>
Well my mom, dad, and one of their friends were in our garage. The door was shut, and before they went in there, my mom said not to come in or anything. I said OK. I decided to just listen by the door, so maybe I would hear something. I didn't really hear anything though. So I decided to open the door. When I opened it, I saw them sitting around the ouija board, and saw their friend. First thing I noticed about him was his elbow.  It was sticking out, like some kind of horn was in his elbow. It was roughly about 5 inches long. I quickly shut the door. It was like a horn on his elbow, but there was skin around it. I had seen this friend before, and he never had this thing on his elbow before. I didn't know what to think.
<br><br>
After a while they came out. I looked at their friend's elbow again, and saw it was still there but it was smaller, like it was shrinking. I told my mom about this recently, but she says she didn't see it on his elbow.
