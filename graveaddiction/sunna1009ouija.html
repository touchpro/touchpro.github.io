On October 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Sunna about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hello, my name is Sunna. I am fourteen, I live in Iceland, and have recently become addicted to messing around with the dead. I am sending a description of my last seance or whatever you would call it. I was alone, so it supprised me how good the results are. Most of it will sound unbelievable, but I swear, everything I say in this letter is true, if maybe not completely accurate. I have a very good memory, but this still happened yesterday, and it is impossible to get everything right - especially when I didn't write it down straight away. Well, here goes nothing. Enjoy.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits in the room? I mean you no harm, don't be scared etc.<br>
Board: Moves very slowly.<br>
<br>
Me: Is that someone? move to YES if there is someone.<br>
Board: eventually gets to yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, can you spell your name for me?<br>
Board: Nickolas<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name Nickolas?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, hi. Are you good?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know my name?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What's my name?<br>
Board: Sunna<br>
<br>
Me: OK, that's creepy.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you from?<br>
Board: America<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, cool, how do you like Iceland?<br>
Board: cold<br>
<br>
Me: How old were you when you died? Oh, sorry, I forgot to put numbers. Just spell out your age.<br>
Board: Sixteen<br>
<br>
Me: Oh. Well, thats a nice age to die. How did you die?<br>
Board: Car accident<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, what do you want?<br>
B Agatha<br>
<br>
Me: Agatha? Is she, well, was she your girlfriend?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want to ask me some questions now?<br>
Board: can you please? I can't.<br>
<br>
Me: Interesting. When did you die?<br>
Board: long time ago<br>
<br>
Me: Can you play the piano?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you play this piano? The one in this room?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, when?<br>
Board: Now.<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, just wait a sec. I'm going to get a camera.<br>
<br>
I get up, fetch a camera, and start recording. I turn the camera to myself, introduce myself, and say what is about to happen. But when I turn the camera around, it's off. I try to see what I recorded, because I definitely managed to record something before I turned it towards me. But there wasn't anything.<br>
<br>
I go back to the board.<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, so no camera. Do I have to let you out of the board first?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Me: OK, goodbye then.<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
I stand up and wait for the ghost to start playing the piano. Nothing happens. I decide to sit at the piano. Then I feel the same feeling that's moving the glass on the board. I feel it start to lift my left hand onto the keys. Its starts stroking the keys. Going back and forth. Then it tries to play a note, by feebly pressing with one finger, but it doesn't work. When he tries it again, I help him. Then he lifts the right hand and does the same. Then he starts playing random chords. Obviously having fun. Plays all the C notes, does scales. Quite slowly though, and with my occasional help.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you having fun? Press C for yes.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you play another instrument? D for no.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Not even guitar?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been playing piano long? I mean before you died?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: How long? Two years?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Three?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Four? etc up to thirteen. Always no.<br>
<br>
Me: did you start the year you died?<br>
Board: yes.<br>
<br>
Starts playing Creep by Radiohead on the piano. I sing along.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you have many friends?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: OK, I'm going to try and guess your stereotype; Emo?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Goth?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Nerd?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Geek<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Creep?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: OK, let's just go to the ouija board again so you can spell it.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
At board:<br>
<br>
Me: hello<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: So what's your stereotype?<br>
Board: afaeaeae<br>
<br>
Me: Try that again?<br>
Board: dafatasae<br>
<br>
Me: .....again?<br>
Board: Dork<br>
<br>
Me: OK<br>
Board: AFATASA YES<br>
<br>
Me: Afatasa?<br>
Board: AFATASA YES<br>
<br>
Me: Is that Nick?<br>
Board: No, Afatasa yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: A demon. Afatasa funny.<br>
<br>
Me: You're funny, huh?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you evil?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Are you clever?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: OK, bye then.<br>
Board: goodbye.<br>
<br>
At piano:<br>
<br>
Me: That was weird.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been here long?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Did you come here when I called you?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like it here?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to stay here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: In this room?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: In this house?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: OK, don't go into my room though.<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
And this went on for quite a while. He plays the piano and occasionally answers my yes or no questions. The weird thing is that when he is controlling my hands, they feel dead. He's controling them a little now. I'm going to let him write something: name is nickolas but am called nick. i have been in this house for  some time, but came into being just yesterday. when you are a ghhost you can't say anything that doesn't js tdog for bar bar voala gakatalifa ag ah soug ejaifidah itja gapa bougfo ap haogt kaga toal. ge brda heit erikur. eg er ekki gamall.

OK, wow, a few different ghosts there. Please don't think I'm doing this for attention. Believe me. Believe this. Please.
