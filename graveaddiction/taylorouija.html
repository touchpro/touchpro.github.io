On August 3, 2005 I received an e-mail from Taylor and Margaret about an interesting ouija board experience they had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My name is Taylor, I am 13 years old and I live in Indiana.
<br><br>
Me and my friend Margaret (also 13) have had a close encounter with the ouija board.  I do not remember all the board said, but I'll tell you most of it.  Well, me and Margaret were going to Meijer's to buy an ouija board.  When we got home, we asked the board if we could speak with her grandmother, Pamela.  Well, we got to talk with her but we were still a bit freaked out.  Her grandma was really nice and really funny.  So me and Margaret continued playing with the ouija board.
<br><br>
One afternoon me and Margaret started playing with the board and we asked to speak with Pam.  The board replied &quot;no&quot;.  We asked why not, and the board said &quot;I don't like you&quot;. I said &quot;you don't even know me&quot;, then the board replied &quot;taylor&quot; and I said that was correct...then the board replied &quot;12&quot; and I asked &quot;what is 12?&quot; It said &quot;your age&quot; (I was 12 at the time), and he said he knew Margaret.  After he told us he knew us, we asked him who he was.  The board replied &quot;it don't matter&quot; and we asked if he was a bad spirit.  He replied &quot;I am no spirit, I am a demon, burn in hell! Burn burn burn&quot;, so we got scared and shut the ouija board.  We called my friend's mom (she's a ghost hunter) and she said to get rid of it because we are in &quot;step one of infestation&quot;.  So we buried it.  
<br.<br>
The next day it was on her bed...come to find out our brothers unburied it.  They don't believe in the board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Nothing ever happened with me, margaret, and the board, and I love playing with it...I don't know whether to quit playing with it or to keep playing with it (I really want to).&quot;
