Tonight my sister and I went to dinner at Old Bag of Nails.  We both got their famous fish 'n chips, which we call "side of orca" since the piece of fish is as big as a whale!!  We came home and started to watch the Mothman Prophecies, but Katy said it kinda freaked her out...she thinks the only time she could stand to watch it would be during the day, NOT at night!  Poor kid, she'll probably have nightmares tonight and it will be all my fault!<br /><br />I had lunch with Mike, Sheri, and Laurie today.  Mike is leaving the company so we took him out for a farewell lunch.  Normally we go someplace nice for farewell lunches, and we always let the guest of honor pick the place.  Well, Mike chose Subway, which we thought was a little odd.  Not that Subway's not a nice place, it's just not the normal type of place one would go to for a going away lunch.  And to make things funnier, this Subway is in a gas station!  We had a good time though.  Mike continued to give me a hard time about using the Ouija board.  He really thinks it's an evil thing, and that I'm putting my soul at risk by using it.  For the most part I still just see it as entertainment.  <br /><br />Mike and I had an interesting conversation at work yesterday...no, not as interesting as the tapeworm conversation I had with Kitty!  Mike was telling me that he really thinks <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a> is a good site, the only part he strongly dislikes/disapproves of is the Mothman section.  He recently saw the movie and thinks the whole thing is evil/fake.  I never thought I'd have a Mothman related conversation with anyone at work, besides Mark of course.  Mike thinks the whole thing is made up, his theory is that the chemicals the military stored in those igloo things in the TNT area must have leaked into the water supply and caused people to have hallucinations.  I really doubt that theory since the majority of people didn't see the Mothman...if it were chemicals in the water more people would have had the hallucinations, and besides, people would have different hallucinations, not the same.  <br /><br />Since I am on the topic of Mothman and Point Pleasant, a person named Jeremy from Milton, WV e-mailed me to tell me about an old psychiatric hospital in Point Pleasant that's right behind the TNT area.  It's supposedly very haunted, so now I have a new place to add to my list of places to visit the next time I make it to Point Pleasant!  Mark and I are thinking about going down there again this spring.  I can't wait!  Mark also told me about an old cemetery, Tyn Rhos, that he's going to take me to as well.  I guess he had a weird experience there, I can't wait to hear about it and visit the cemetery!<br><br>

Tonight on the way home from work I experienced something annoying.  No, not stupid/crazy drivers.  Well, actually I did witness some crazy drivers but that's not what annoyed me the most tonight.  The socks I wore to work today have a tendency to slip down over the course of a day, I think they may be too loose.  Anyway, when I got on the freeway I felt the sock on my right foot bunched up under my toes.  And for some reason it just really started to annoy me!  In fact it was so bad I even considered pulling over to the side of the road to fix it.  However, instead of doing that I wiggled my toes around with the hope that my sock would straighten out.  Of course, all that did was make it worse.  I tried to think about other things, but my mind kept wandering back to my uncomfortable foot.  Finally a song I like (<i>Not Falling</i> by Mudvayne) came on, and that was all it took to take my mind away from my sock problem.  I'll have to remember to NOT wear those socks the next time I'm going to be driving!<br /><br />Today everyone at work was asking how the interview with <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> went.  Everyone is also excited about seeing the article in the paper and making me autograph it!  I told them they really didn't need autographs, but I'm sure the day it's actually printed I'll have quite a few people visiting my desk.  And I thought the attention from being an IAS employee of the month nominee was bad! :)<br /><br />When I was talking to Cassandra about the interview for the paper she asked me what kind of questions Jeb asked.  So I told her that he asked about the blog, the frogs, the ghosts, the cemeteries, and even the nerd prom!  One thing he asked me about the blog was whether it felt strange to put all of my personal thoughts out here on the web.  Since I really don't put anything too personal out here I told him it didn't bother me.  So when I told Cassandra about that question and my answer she said "Oh, so he doesn't know your darkest secret - that you're really a secret, undercover Martha Stewart!?!?!".  She accuses me of being Martha Stewart-like all the time, and I have to say that I disagree...well, I guess it's more like I'm in denial!  I guess I do a few things that could make Cassandra think of me as an "undercover Martha Stewart".  I have canned salsa and jam/jelly with my mom, I've made my own potpouri, soap, and lotion.  I also enjoy cooking and gardening.  But I think those are the only things I do that can be compared to Martha.  I have lunch plans with Cassandra tomorrow, I'll have to ask her if she can think of anything else to add to the list.<br /><br />I talked with my mom tonight about the tapeworm conversation I had with Kitty this afternoon.  It turns out my mom is quite the worm expert, she told me all sorts of stories and facts about them.  She even told me the differences between different types of worms people can get.  The conversation was actually quite disgusting, but it was probably worse for my mom since she ate noodles for dinner!!<br /><br />Oh, one more thing that happened at work today...when I was talking with Cassandra our friend Mike stopped by.  He was giving me a hard time about the Ouija board again - he thinks it's evil and that I "shouldn't get mixed up in that occult stuff".  Cassandra and Victoria (who Mike pulled into the conversation) agreed with him.  Sure, I guess it could be evil, but if you're careful I don't see the harm in it.  I mean, I'm still not 100% convinced that it really works.  But I'm curious as to what all you readers think.  If you have an opinion you'd like to share please post your comment below.  I'm interested to know people's opinions on this!<br><br>

I just had a very unusual conversation.  Kitty stopped by to tell me how excited she was that her home work PC is finally being configured.  We then started talking about nonwork related stuff, and she mentioned that she is starting to feel sick.  She went on to say that she just can't get sick again (she was just out in December with some kind of flu), the only good thing about being sick again would be losing more weight.  We laughed about the "being sick" weight loss program and how easy it is, and I then mentioned "well, I guess the only easier thing would be to get a tapeworm".  Thus began our unusual conversation about tapeworms!  Kitty said her husband told her the only way to get rid of tapeworms was to tie a piece of meat to a string, swallow it, and then pull the tapeworm out.  I told her there had to be some kind of medicine or something so we decided to do a search on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.  We found out that there are medications, but we also read about some old wive's tales that were quite amusing.  These were our two favorite links:<br /><ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.oldwivestales.net/QandAarticle1010.html">Is this a true way to cure tapeworms?</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/vanities/tapeworm.htm">As the Worm Squirms</a> - you'll have to check out the last paragraph that begins with "Other versions..."!<br /></ol><br />It's not everyday that systems analysts can say they discussed tapeworms at work!!<br><br>

It's that time of year again...time to write objectives for work.  I always dread this.  Not because I don't have any objectives or things I want to develop, but because I find it extremely difficult to plan out the things I want to work on for the entire year.  This year might be easier though...one of my coworkers, Brenda, has decided to make her objective learning TestDirector (new test plan/defect tracking software that we use) better, and she wants me to help out by giving her detailed training.  And if I do that it means I might be able to make training her one of my objectives.  So really, she sort of took a lot of thought out of planning my objectives which really helps me out!  Now that I have the idea I just need to develop it and put my ideas into the right format.  I'm also excited about this because I enjoy showing people new things to do with the software we use because it makes me feel good to know that I may have made someone's job easier by sharing any helpful hints/shortcuts I have discovered.<br /><br />I am so excited about getting my cemetery pictures back tomorrow.  I'm really interested in seeing the pictures from one of the cemeteries in Thurston, OH.  My mom and I saw a headstone there that we think may be distant relatives.  If we remember correctly, the wife's name was Carrie and she was about the same age as my great grandmother...which makes us all wonder if she might be the Carrie the Ouija board spelled out!<br><br>

This afternoon I had my interview with <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i>.  I managed to make myself extremely nervous about it, but I think it went very well.  Jeb (the reporter) had quite a few questions, but none were too difficult to answer.  It's still strange to think that someone actually wanted to write about my blog/sites!  Jeb said the article will probably be in the Monday paper in 3-4 weeks, so when I see it I'll be sure to scan it and post it here for all of you to see!<br /><br />Since it involves "family" stuff I'm going to be vague and not say what the letter is about, but remember my post from 1/15?  The one about the Ouija board experience with John and Ryan?  Well, one of the things the board "told" us was that my mom and I were supposed to find a letter so my great grandmother's (the spirit talking to us) soul could be at peace.  Monday afternoon my parents were going through some of the papers my uncle kept, and they found the letter the board described!  I swear I wasn't pushing the message indicator, and John and Ryan would have never been able to guess the letter's contents...I'm a little freaked out!  However, at the same time I'm also intrigued, I think I'd kind of like to try the Ouija board again to see if we have similar results.<br /><br />I dropped all of my film off today.  Since I had so much it'll be Thursday before I can pick it up.  You can expect some updates to <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a> this weekend!!<br /><br />Speaking of cemeteries, I mentioned in my last post that one of the cemeteries I visited was in Haydenville, OH.  The cemetery I visited there was Wolfe Cemetery.  It is at the top of a hill, and it's famous (at least in the world of people with cemetery fetishes!) for a grave that's surrounded by an iron fence.  The grave is rather large, there's a small headstone at the top of a <b>long</b> concrete slab.  The whole thing is surrounded by a rusty iron fence, one of the fences that have the spikey things at the top.  Rumor says that a witch was burned there, and that her body is buried in that grave.  If you touch the grave you're supposed to feel heat, and if you lay on it you'll be sucked into Hell!  Now I thought it would look pretty silly to lay on a grave (plus it'd be kind of disrespectful), but I did touch it.  It was covered in snow, and I didn't feel any heat which was a little disappointing.  However, a few minutes later my left hand (the one I touched the grave with) felt <b>EXTREMELY</b> hot.  My right hand felt normal.  I thought maybe the hot feeling was just a result of my hand finally warming up from being in the snow, but it lasted for the rest of the weekend.  I made everyone feel it, and everyone agreed that it did seem hot.  I'm still trying to find a logical explanation, but I'm afraid there might not be one!!<br><br>

I had a good weekend, I just can't believe it's already over!  <br /><br />Friday night I dropped John's carpet cleaner off at Ryan's house.  I wasn't planning to stay too long since I had dinner plans with some friends from high school, but I ended up staying at his place for almost 5 hours!  His three year old was staying with him, so we did things like looking for monsters/ghosts, building towers, etc.  I really did have a fun time.  <br /><br />Saturday I visited a few more cemeteries and took pictures for <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a>.  I visited one in Lithopolis, two in Carroll, two in Baltimore, one in Lancaster, and one in Haydenville.  I'll probably start getting the pictures from this weekend and the past weekend out on the site later this week.  <br /><br />Today I didn't do much at all.  I did a little (and I do mean <i>little</i>!) cleaning, and I watched one of the old Vincent Price horror movies Ryan let me borrow.  I just love old horror movies!<br><br>

I was looking through the <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">Site Meter</a> referral log and someone found my blog looking for "Eminem Fan Art"....I'm sure they were quite disappointed to find that the only time I mentioned Eminem here was when I was talking about my 50 year old mom losing her favorite Eminem CD!<br /><br />Well thankfully Katy, my sister, didn't experience any ghostly activites at my place last night.  I think she scared them away when she sang "Under the Sea" to my cichlids and plecos...poor little fish!  The only odd thing she heard was a door opening and closing while I was in the shower.  I heard it too actually, and I was thinking "why did Katy go in my room?".  Guess she didn't go in my room, but when I got out of the shower and opened my door I noticed that my closet door was open.  Strange stuff!<br><br>

Today was a really slow day at work, meaning the time went by slow.  That kind of surprised me since we've been really busy, usually time flies when there's a lot to do.<br /><br />Tonight my sister came over to my place after class.  She decided to spend the night here since it snowed and the roads aren't too great.  We went to dinner and then to Target since she forgot to bring a toothbrush and some other essentials.  I don't want to make it sound like I don't like winter because I really do like it, but I think I'm ready for spring...and it's only January!  I'm a little bored with snow now, I'm ready to start working in the garden.  But I have to wait until at least the middle of May before I can start gardening.  If the next few months go as fast as this one spring will be here before I know it!<br><br>

The Ouija board worked!!  I wasn't expecting to play with it tonight, but John and Ryan came over to drop off John's carpet cleaner.  We talked for awhile, and as they were getting ready to leave they spotted the Ouija board that was still laying on my table from the time Chrissie and Susan came over.  So we decided to try it out.  John played with Ouija boards a lot while he was in school, and he has experienced some pretty strange things.  Ryan had never played with one, and my only experience wasn't too exciting.  The first few questions we asked tonight didn't get any response.  We were going to give up, but John and I decided to try one more time...and nothing happened.  Then Ryan joined in again, and this time the message indicator moved.  We decided to ask if the person (spirit) who had been moving things around my apartment was in the room.  The message indicator went to the "Yes" part of the board.  Then we asked the spirit several questions, and she spelled out the answers to them.  The spirit spelled out my great grandmother's name, told us that she was here because of the "tableskirt" that "she made" with "Carrie".  That was just too weird, because that's who I thought was moving things, and I thought she was her because of the lace tablecloth!!  I'm not sure who Carrie is, I'll have to look through some of my great grandmother's postcards to see if there is any reference to her.  We also asked if she would harm us, and she said "no", but she didn't want us to use the Ouija board for fear that a bad spirit could use it to deceive us.  She also said that her spirit was not at peace, because she wants us to find a ring and a letter...she even told us what the letter was about!  That was weird because my mom has had dreams telling her to look in certain places for an unnamed object.  She said her spirit would be at peace when we found them.  She also thanked me for taking care of the tablecloth and she even told us "bye".  I thought my mom may have told John and/or Ryan my great grandmother's name and about her dreams, etc but they swear she never did.  We called her and she also said that she didn't tell them.  All of us swear that we weren't moving the indicator.  And unlike last time, the message indicator moved quite fast.  I'm still a little freaked out, hopefully I'll be able to get some sleep! :)  It was kind of fun!<br /><br />I already cleaned the living room carpet, it's still damp but it looks nice.  I just love it when things are clean!  <br><br>

I'm so excited...Ryan, a friend from work, has offered to explore Athens with me sometime in March or April!!  Athens, Ohio is known for it's creepy cemeteries and eerie buildings, like the old asylum.  I've wanted to go there and explore, but since I'm rather talented at getting lost I've been putting the trip off.  Ryan grew up in that area though, so he knows it very well.  It should be fun!  Also, Matt from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ohio_lost/main.html">Ohio Lost</a> offered to be a tour guide and show me places to explore in the Cleveland area.  Sounds like I'll have plenty to keep me busy!<br /><br />Now I don't want to say too much, but it looks like this little blog may be getting some attention!  Last night I got an e-mail from a reporter with <i><a href="http://www.dispatch.com">The Columbus Dispatch</a></i>, our local newspaper.  I guess they have a column called "Life Stories", where they feature an interesting person from the area every Monday.  The reporter who contacted me said he found my blog while searching for "Columbus Ohio Weblogs".  He wanted to know if I'd be willing to do an interview!!  After thinking about it and calling my family and friends to ask their opinions I decided to set up an interview.   He's coming over with a photographer next week, so I'll have to make sure the frogs look nice and pretty for pictures :)  And I'll also have to make sure I clean the fish tank so they don't think I make my fish live in toxic waste!  I'll definitely keep you updated on whether or not they actually use my interview in the paper.  Here's another amusing thing about the interview...my friends are excited about my blog being recognized, but they all told me that I better not write anything bad/embarassing about them now.   As if I ever write anything negative about them!  Of course, now they better make sure they stay on my good side, hahahahahahahaha!  Just kidding!<br><br>

Well, today wasn't bad for a Monday.  My day at work went really fast, but it wasn't one of those bad fast days where it's an hour before you're supposed to leave and you think "oh no, I can't believe it's already so late...I have a million things left to do".  I ended up leaving on time.  After work I drove to Worthington to check out a cemetery my friend Sheri told me about.  It's right at 161 and 23, and I think it's the St John's Cemetery...I need to do some research to find out.  It was an old cemetery, lots of veterans from the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 were buried there.  So now I have two more rolls of film to develop, Cord Camera is going to love me!<br /><br />Check out this business card...I think this is one of the funniest slogans I've seen lately:<br /><br /><center><img src="ddeeds.jpg"></center><br /><br />I absolutely love the "We pick up where you dog left off" slogan!   It definitely succeeds at getting a person's attention!<br><br>

OK, the new site is now up and running...but I still haven't removed the old pages from Hoppy Together.  I may do that tomorrow.  But anyway, to visit my new cemetery/haunted places site go here: <b><a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">http://www.graveaddiction.com</a></b>.  <br /><br />Speaking of cemeteries, today I visited eight more around Fairfield County.  I also took some pictures of the old Erie Canal that still runs through Millersport, Ohio.  I ended up taking five rolls of film, so it's going to be a week or two before I get them all developed, scanned, and put on the site.  All of the cemeteries we visited today were really old, I can't wait to see how the pictures turn out.  <br /><br />Tonight I finally watched <i>The Mothman Prophecies</i>.  A lot of people I talked to absolutely hated it, but I really enjoyed it.  But maybe that's because I've read a lot about the <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/mothman.html">Mothman</a> sitings, and talked with people who have experienced weird things in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.  I also watched <i>Signs</i> tonight...it's unusual for me to watch two movies in the same day!  I thought <i>Signs</i> was very good too, but I didn't think it was as scary as some people made it sound.  <br /><br />I don't have any big plans for tomorrow.  I really need to clean, I haven't done that lately.  I do know one thing that I'm definitely going to do...sleep in!  I haven't been sleeping well lately, and I think the lack of sleep is finally catching up with me.  So I'm going to turn off the ringer on the phone so no one wakes me up and sleep in until at least 9:00!<br><br>

Last night while updating my site I noticed that I am starting to add a lot of cemetery pages to the site.  Enough that I decided to purchase another domain!  It's not up and running yet, but when it is I'll post a link here in the blog.  I'll take all of the cemetery/haunted place pages off Hoppy Together and put them on the new site.  I'm planning to keep the entire "About Me" section on Hoppy Together, so there will still be some non-frog related stuff.  I never thought I'd start another separate website, this is just too exciting!!<br><br>

Yay!!!  It looks like my site is finally working correctly again, which means I'll be able to update my blog on a daily basis again!  Of course, I guess I could have done that even when my site was having issues.  But since I couldn't publish anything I decided to just wait.  I think I got all of the files FTP'd to the new address, but if you notice anything funny please let me know so I can fix it!  So far the only thing I dislike (well, absolutely hate actually) about the new site software is the webmail.  It's just terrible.  I can't create address books, I can't add a signature, I can't specify how many messages to display (it displays 5 messages per screen)...basically all I can do is basic e-mail functions.  I think I may try to find a different web based e-mail to add to my site, if I can figure out how to install it.  And I can always set it up on Outlook too.<br /><br />In addition to moving all of my existing files to the new IP, I also added a few new pages/pictures:<br /><ol><br /><li>Added four new cemetery pages (all from Baltimore, Ohio):<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="popcreek.html">Poplar Creek Cemetery</a><br /><li><a href="heim256.html">Cemetery on State Route 256 near Heimberger Road</a><br /><li><a href="stmichaels.html">Saint Michael's Cemetery</a><br /><li><a href="baltrome.html">Baltimore Cemetery on North Street (in old Rome side of town)</a><br /></ul><br /><li>I also broke my old "Friends and Family" page into 7 new pages.  Actually, 2 pages have all new pictures, I've marked them with ****:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="family.html">Family</a><br /><li><a href="newyears2003.html">****2002/2003 New Year's Party</a><br /><li><a href="newyears2002.html">2001/2002 New Year's Party</a><br /><li><a href="workfriends.html">****Friends at Work</a><br /><li><a href="nerdprom.html">Nerd Prom 2000</a><br /><li><a href="focus.html">Friends from Project FOCUS</a><br /><li><a href="miscfriends.html">Misc. Friend Pictures</a><br /></ul><br /></ol><br />So even though I haven't been able to blog (and let me say I was experiencing serious blog withdrawal!), I have stayed busy making site updates!<br /><br />Since I brought up cemetery pictures, I'd like to thank <a href="http://sdominick.blogspot.com">Sharon</a> for sending me the link to the <a href="http://www.ghosttoghost.com/cemetery.htm">Ghost to Ghost Cemetery</a> page and suggesting that I send them my <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/tico/tico5.jpg">&quot;specimens&quot; gravestone</a> picture from the <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/tico.html">TICO Cemetery</a> here in Columbus. David Van Slyke, Ghost to Ghost's webmaster (or ghostmaster as it says on the site!) posted the picture on the cemetery page so now one of my photos is featured there!<br /><br />Let's see, what else has been going on?  Well, I had a weird dream last night which really isn't too unusal since I never have normal dreams!  Last night I had a dream that a few friends from high school and I found this shiny green glittery manual and a computer diskette.  The manual and diskette belonged to some people I made up and Chrissie's new boyfriend, Raj.  I guess they were planning to use the contents of the manual and diskette to take over the world, so they were chasing us.  They finally caught us in the Greenlawn Cemetery parking lot.  Raj was telling Danielle and I how he and his friends were planning to use these materials to cause mass destruction.  Now in real life I'm sure it would have scared me, but in my dream I could care less.  The thing that did upset me in my dream was when Raj said that he planned to go back to his desk at Nationwide and work on fixing a few programming defects in the disk's code on his work computer.  I started yelling at him about how he shouldn't use his work computer or company time to do that, I was irate.  And what's funny about that is I could honestly care less what personal things people do on their computer at work or during company time!   Tonight at dinner I told Chrissie about my dream and she thinks it's awful that I have dreams that sort of involve work/computer things.  I suppose I would have to agree with her on that one!  But really, not all of my dreams involve work...just last week I dreamed about a tree growing through the center of an old abandoned house I was having a party at!<br /><br />Brenda, one of my friends at work, told me about <a href="http://www.penzeys.com">Penzey's</a>...it's an <b>awesome</b> spice store.  They sell tons of different spices, and they have really good prices.  I stopped there on my way home from work and picked up a few things: jalapeno pepper flakes, some kind of Turkish blend, vanilla sugar, some dried hot peppers from Pakistan (I can't remember what they're called off the top of my head), vindaloo curry, and vietnamese cinnamon.  I can't wait to cook with them.<br /><br />I just thought of something else I wanted to put out here.  Check out this ad that was on a paper placemat at Mauger's, a seafood restaurant in Lancaster:<br /><br /><center><img src="lithcemad.jpg"></center><br /><br />It's not everday that you go to a restaurant and see a cemetery ad on a placemat!  Especially not one advertising "one free grave per household"!  It made me laugh!!<br /><br />Really, I can't think of anything else interesting to talk about.  I've been spending a lot of time working...I have lots of testing to finish for my project, and last Thursday I stayed at work from 6:45AM-12:09AM on Friday.  We were QC'ing year end statements.  At least I didn't have to get up early and drive to work on Friday, Ben (my manager) let me sleep in and work from home later in the morning.  <br /><br />Anyway, at least I can sleep easy knowing that my site is fixed and I can update it regularly until the next interruption from <a href="http://www.siteturn.com">Siteturn</a> comes along!  I shouldn't complain, overall they're a pretty good webhosting company.<br /><br><br>

I am currently in the process of having my site moved to a new IP address.  It should be finished in at least 48 hours (hopefully!).  The reason hoppytogether.com is being moved is because my webhosting company has new admin software.  I had to move all 3,000+ files to the new address, which took an eternity since I had them saved in various places.  <br /><br />Once the changes are complete I'll start blogging again on a daily basis!<br><br>

<b>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!</b><br /><br />Hope all of you had a great holiday season!   I had a good Christmas, and New Year's Eve was fun too!  But now I'm kind of exhausted from all of the celebrating :)  <br /><br />This past weekend I finally went to see the second <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie, <i>The Two Towers</i>.  It was awesome, even better than <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>!  And not only was the movie great, but there were lots of good previews too.  Now I can't wait until April to see Stephen King's <i>Dreamcatcher</i>.  I bought the book when it came out, but didn't start reading it.  I like Stephen King's books, but usually it takes me a little while to get into them, so I put off reading it.  But now I've started it, and I really like it so far.  I think it'll be interesting to see how they turn it into a movie.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot...I have another wierd "haunted tablecloth" story.  Last weekend I was burning some candles, like I always do on the weekend.  I have three tealight holders that sit on the bookshelf, on top of the tablecloth.  The middle tealight stopped burning about two hours before the other two, because the wick burnt weird and got buried under the wax...none of the wick was sticking out.  Then about four hours later later the other two burnt down and went out.  An hour or so later I was sitting on the couch when I saw smoke coming out from what I thought was the middle tealight.  But that was impossible since there was no wick left to burn, so I got up to check it out.  I walked over to the bookshelf and there was no doubt that the middle tealight candle was indeed smoking, but there was no flame or wick.  There was quite a bit of smoke.  I checked the other two tealights to make sure it wasn't coming from them, but like I said, they went out oer an hour before this happened, all that was left were the little metal things that hold the wicks.  Then it just stopped.  I was wide awake, so I wasn't imagining it.  Pretty weird, isn't it?!?<br><br>
