On July 17, 2009 I received an e-mail from Craig P. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was working on a compilaton of my experiences with Ouija in the past (it's July 17, 2009), and I think the one by Bob and Beth and Ashley kinda resembles messages I've had with one or more people.
<br><br>
First, ever had people or friends tell you that the board's nothing but hogwash, or just a game? How they deceive themselves! Results that G. Wilen. and I had with Ouija in Fall 1985 will clarify that it is not a game. Most certainly not. A former politician of North Dakota, the Dean of a private college I went to, and a former classmate that I hadn't seen or talked to in 29 years all colluded with the same story. Two years ago I called my old friend Blake C., and he said the Board had recounted an incident that happened near him, and 600 miles away from us, true to detail. It sorrowfully grieves me to think of our poor little friend Lonnie that tragically drowned near our hometown, that the Board was trying to inform me about.
<br><br>
First: it doesn't matter what religion you adhere to, whether you're Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, or Agnostic: remember, God is our Creator and he gave quite a few of us a strong will and mind to think for ourselves and make our own decisions.  The only way to stop people from progressive entrapment by bad spirits, or the Devil, is to put a barricade across the Occult section in bookstores: &quot;Weak-minded Individuals Not Allowed Beyond This Point.&quot; Feeble minds will certainly lead to their own destruction.
<br><br>
OK- the two girls in one entry I read, Ashley and Beth, said they were contacted by &quot;Ezekiel&quot;...well, in Fall 1985, a spirit named &quot;Abraham&quot; came on our board and feverishly spelled out details of global tension: &quot;Third world nations hunger...second worlds nations chemical war..1st world nations, nuclear war. Ethiopia...Death is there.&quot;  It was really only a week or two that nationwide newspapers gave headline news about the terrible famine in Ethiopia. Seriously, those desert nations have constantly been in crisis, but I remember local city news gave pictures of the famine and widespread death in East Africa. (Live Aid concert with Zeppelin, Sabbath and Phil Collins, etc. was that next July).
<br><br>
This spirit named &quot;Abraham&quot; frenetically wrote us instructions on how to build a hermetically sealed fallout shelter, and for us only to distill water from the air, not the ground. It has to be built with 7 sides, one side less than an octagon.
<br><br>
The night went on, towards 1:00 or 2:00 A.A.  My Ouijin' buddy G. Wilen. insisted we couldn't stay awake longer - the spirit said &quot;NO! I'm trying to help you to survive!&quot;
<br><br>
We said, &quot;If you're with us, could you put out a candle?&quot; (We were burning 2 candles for ambiance).  When we went upstairs to make coffee, and Led Zep's &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was quietly playing on the stereo, we came back into the rec room where the board was, and G. Wilen. exclaimed, &quot;Oh my God, Craig, Look!&quot;  One candle had snuffed out on its own...We kept talking to Abraham and soon, the 2nd candle ran out of wax. As a farewell, the spirit said, &quot;The candle is dying, and so is the Earth.&quot; &quot;Goodbye.&quot;
<br><br>
I would like to add that a bit before, the board spelled out, &quot;Craig -- you have a chance to escape your fate. Save the Word of God and deny Satan.&quot;
<br><br>
If any of you have heard how they run the operation in hell, the names Of God, Jesus, or the Virgin Mary are not allowed to be uttered. This was not a demon talking to us, I could only think it was a spirit in limbo, or Purgatory, trying to make good and help us in order to find closure or peace I guess.
<br><br>
Ouija fans, I'm running outta time, I have to do some shopping. I have more true tales to tell, I'll log on later.
