On October 2, 2004 I received an e-mail from Alan in Ireland.  He shared this creepy ouija board experience (as well as a little background info regarding the story) with me:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;Three friends were walking home school one day, they were walking along a river. One of the girls dropped her cell phone into the river and she tried to pick it up out of the water but she fell in. Her name was Lynse. One of the boys then tried to jump in after her, his name was Victor.  The other friend (don't know his name) rang for help after seeing his friends struggle to get out. The current was very strong and drifted them both out of the bank. When the help arrived, only the boy's body was found , he was dead.  The girl disappeared.  I didn't know Victor, but my friend Jess did and she went to the funeral. I didn't go.
<br><br>
A week went by and they still couldn't find Lynse's body.  Me and my three friends decided to go to an abandoned house in the country to use the board, no one could see us as it was surrounded by trees.  It was a dump of a house, there were liquor bottles and the stairs were gone.  It had collapsed. So we made our own stairs.  I was the first to get up there, then I helped the rest. Before we started the board I decided to go climbing around the house and out the front window.  I stood on the ledge, but I fell suddenly onto concrete because it broke.  But the weird thing was I didn't hurt myself one bit.  But I do remember falling, and as I fell I could feel something guiding me down.  I thought it was Victor, but thought no more of it.
<br><br> 
Anyway, I went back up and we decided to do the board to get in touch with Victor to find out if he would tell us where Lynse was.  We finally got in touch with him and he was talking to us nicely.  We then decided to get to the point, we asked if he knew where she was. He said yes.
<br><br>
We asked where, he said underwater.
<br><br>
We asked where underwater, he said Shannon. (The Shannon River is the main river flowing through Ireland)
<br><br>
We asked is she would be found. He said yes.
<br><br>
We asked when.  He went to the number three.
<br><br>
We didn't know what this meant, but when we asked different questions he was constantly going to the number 3. 
<br><br> 
Three days later I was walking down to my friend Jess's house and she saw me and came running up to me.  She said Lynse was found that morning, underwater in the Shannon.  That's when I realized 3 meant in three days time, all his information about the future of her body was correct.&quot;</blockquote>
