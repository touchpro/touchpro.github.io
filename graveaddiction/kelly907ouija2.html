On September 17, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kelly T. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me (Kelly), Bria, and Maria were all playing the ouija board at Maria's house.  This is where we usually have some good or bad experiences. So we started playing and requested Mac, my protector. We got him, but it didn't feel like his cheery self. So obviously we didn't believe it was him. We were all talking about how we didn't think it was him, and suddenly we hear 3 LOUD thumps from right underneath the board. Maria ran screaming out of the room to go yell at her dad for making the noises, but to her discovery he was sitting on the couch with her little brother and mom. Which only meant one thing...that it was not them.
<br><br>
Later on, Maria and Bria were sitting on the floor talking about it, and I started to see something on her carpet. I was trying to read it outloud and Maria asked me what I was doing. I said, &quot;I see something in the carpet.&quot; I finally got it, and read it outloud:  &quot;It's RJ,&quot; which is the spirit who claims to be the ruler of the dead. They both suddenly stood up and couldn't believe their eyes. We started to watch the carpet. It eventually spelled out &quot;Kelly is the chosen one,&quot; and then suddenly arrows started to appear on the carpet and they were pointing to Me, Bria, and Maria. Then it spelled out HELP. We, of course, were in disbelief that this was happening to us. All of a sudden something else started to be spelled out...it looked like another language but we made it out...it spelled RUN, and of course we're not going to stick around to see what happens. We ran and we were almost having panic attacks! We were so amazed at what had happened. We all ran into the living room and slept there.  We didn't go into the room until the next day.
<br><br>
I know this story seems completely unbelieveable, but trust me - I swear on my soul that this stuff happened.  We will never play in that house again, but we still do play at my house and only with the three of us or more.
