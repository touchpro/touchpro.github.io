On November 17, 2009 I received an e-mail from Stephanie L. visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

During the summer, my friend Meghan and I used a Ouija Board. We had been doing a lot and still are really interested in them, but we don't do them anymore. Anyways, we were trying to record it with a voice recorder. We started, and then all of a sudden the voice recorder beeped, which means it stopped recording. So we thought that was a little weird, and we tried again. We were talking to the spirit of a little girl, can't really remember more details than that. I asked if she minded if we recorded this session, and the planchette sped to YES, and the second it touched YES, the recorder beeped. We were a little freaked out. I thought, maybe it is just a coincidence, maybe the battery is low. I checked it, and it said the battery was almost full. We decided to try one more time, so we told her that we don't mean to offend her, but if it was really her shutting the recorder off, then to please do it once more. We waited for a few minutes and nothing happened. Meghan told me she didn't think anything was going to happen, and I said that we should give her a minute, it may take her a minute. Just as I said that, the recorder beeped again. We were really freaked out after that, and decided to put it away. I haven't used a Ouija Board since.
