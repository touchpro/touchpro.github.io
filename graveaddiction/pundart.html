<b>Great food, old-fashioned setting offset possible spooks</b>
<br><br>
NEWBURY, Ohio - As the leaves turn to gold and the winds become whispers and howls, Punderson Manor offers a cozy, comfortable getaway.  But our stay at the state park lodge in Geauga County took a deliciously chilling turn once we learned about the ghosts.
<br><br>
How could Punderson not be haunted?
<br><br>
Most of Ohio's seven state park lodges are open-beamed, high-vaulted, nouveau-rustic structures that would look right at home in Vail, Colo., or Jackson Hole, Wyo., the kind of places where weekend snowboarders or fly-fishermen would hang out to play at being cowboys.
<br><br>
But Punderson is more <i>Hound of the Baskervilles</i> than <i>A River Runs Through It</i>.
<br><br>
The Tudor-style mansion was begun in 1929 as a private home.  But the Depression forced the owner - a Detroit tycoon - to abandon the expensive project even as it neared completion.  The structure moldered for 20 years until the state bought it along with Punderson Lake and the surrounding land.
<br><br>
The house sat empty until 1956 when it was renovated and opened to the public.  Another renovation was finished in 1982.
<br><br>
Now Punderson's 31 guest rooms provide all the modern amenities visitors expect, in a decidely old-fashioned - some might say spooky - setting.
<br><br>
My youngest son and I were having a great time even before we learned about the ghosts.
<br><br>
We enjoyed a nature hike along Punderson Lake, which, unlike most lakes in Ohio, wasn't built for flood control or speed boating.
<br><br>
Covering about 100 acres, the lake dates back about 12,000 years to the last ice age when a glacier retreated, leaving a huge block of ice behind.  When the ice melted, Punderson Lake, the largest and deepest kettle lake in Ohio, resulted.
<br><br>
Gasoline-powered boats are prohibited, so the lake is always quiet, always serene.  The calm water, encircled with lily pads and rushes, made an ideal backdrop for a hike.  But even though the lake has a small beach, when the time came for a swim, we opted for chlorination.
<br><br>
The water in the large indoor pool had just been changed and was ice cold.  But the outdoor pool still had an end-of-summer warmth, and we performed a few end-of-summer underwater handstands before the evening breeze picked up.
<br><br>
Even then, a few of the parks many maples were turning a rich orange, although peak fall color at Punderson shouldn't arrive until mid-October.  I tried not to think about the changing seasons.
<br><br>
But winter will come, and when it does, visitors might appreciate the park's winter-sports chalet, sledding hill, 6 miles of cross-country ski trails and 4 miles of snowmobile trails.
<br><br>
The weather was mild, however, during our visit.
<br><br>
Mike and I split two tennis matches.  (In my defense, I was wearing sandals during my loss.)
<br><br>
And I cleaned his 13-year-old clock at shuffleboard.  Fortunately, he has yet to learn that it's an old-man's game.
<br><br>
The food at Punderson was remarkable, the best I've encountered at a state park.  I still have bad memories of one cold, dry, tasteless salmon I encountered months ago at an otherwise fine park lodge.
<br><br>
Happily, dry and tasteless were not on the menu at Punderson.
<br><br>
The lodge sits close enough to the highway and nearby towns to make the restaurant itself a destination, our waitress said.  Many diners come just for the food and never stay overnight, she said.
<br><br>
After enjoying succulent lake trout for breakfast and tender medallions of beef crusted in Stilton cheese for dinner, I understood why.
<br><br>
With my encouragement, Mike has been experimenting with new foods as he accompanies me on some of my travels.  At dinner he informed our waitress that a few weeks earlier he had tried crab cakes and tht night he would have his first roast duck (which he loved).
<br><br>
&quot;So what was your latest food adventure?&quot; she asked him.
<br><br>
&quot;Uh, at breakfast this morning I had my first mush.&quot;
<br><br>
Charmed, the waitress told Mike that the mansion was allegedly haunted.
<br><br>
&quot;Do <i>you</i> believe that?&quot; he asked.
<br><br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.  &quot;I've been here 10 years, and I haven't seen anything.  But maybe some strange things happen, and I just ignore them.&quot;
<br><br>
Whatever haunts Punderson apparently does not frighten away any paying customers.  The waitress happily provided us with a copy of <i>The Ghosts of Punderson Manor</i>, a four-page, 8,500 word account of weird phenomena - including self-closing doors, self-turning bathroom taps - and specters - including a hanged man and a seaweed-enshrouded girl.
<br><br>
Mike, like me, doesn't believe in ghosts, except maybe around a campfire.  Still, he was mesmerized.
<br><br>
Once it turned dark, I suggested that we conduct our own little seance in the tower library in the oldest part of the building.
<br><br>
We were watching <i>Star Wars: Episode II</i>, so it wasn't hard to persuade my son to abandon the television.
<br><br>
&quot;Should I turn it off?&quot; Mike asked.
<br><br>
&quot;No.  I usually leave the TV on when I'm away from my hotel room.  It discourages thieves.  And ghosts!&quot;
<br><br>
At the front desk we borrowed an Ouija board, one of the many games available to guests.
<br><br>
We made our way to the dark, empty library.
<br><br>
We rested our hands, ever so gently, on the Ouija pointer.
<br><br>
I whispered my question to the ether.
<br><br>
&quot;Are there any ghosts in Punderson Manor?&quot;
<br><br>
The pointer shuddered, rocked, and started creeping up the board.
<br><br>
I could feel a tingling in my spine and was suddenly aware of tiny hairs on the back of my neck.
<br><br>
The pointer picked up speed, changed direction and suddenly came to rest on an answer.
<br><br>
<i>No.</i>
<br><br>
&quot;The ghost is a joker, Dad,&quot; said my son, cracking up.
<br><br>
&quot;Right&quot; I said, also laughing.  &quot;So who is sending this message?&quot;
<br><br>
Much too slowly for a couple of skeptics, the Ouija spelled out <i>VITSFGTERROR</i>.
<br><br>
&quot;Sheeya, right,&quot; said Mike, rolling his eyes.
<br><br>
When we got back to the room, the television was off, of course.
<br><br>
&quot;It's the Vits Fig Terror!&quot; said Mike, not terrified at all.  &quot;I guess he didn't like the movie either.&quot;
<br><br>
We both knew there was a logical explanation.  We just didn't know what it was.
<br><br>
And the only howling we heard outside our window that night was the wind in the dying leaves.
<br><br>
Vits Fig Terror or no, we slept the sleep of angels, my spine tingling only a little.
