On July 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Becca about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I am Becca, and I'm 13 years old. Only two of my friends and I had played with an Ouija board before, so we invited everyone over.  Myself, Kasey, and Amber all had played with one...Jacob, Kyle, and Deanna had not.
<br><br>
We gathered around the ouija board and placed our hands on it. We asked if anyone was there and it said yes. We simply asked it simple and funny questions, only to entertain ourselves. I left the room to get a drink and they called me back in the room saying, &quot;It wants you, Becca!!!&quot;
<br><br>
So I ran in there and saw it spelling &quot;Becca&quot; over and over and over. I put my hands on it...we were still joking around until Kasey asked when he died, 1910, and I asked his name, Greg. Amber asked what it wanted me for, and it said possess. Amber asked why he wanted to possess me, and it said SEX. And she asked with who, and it said Jacob. Then we all laughed and continued asking it questions...finding out that it was my past life's lover.
<br><br>
I didn't really believe it because I believe the subconscious mind controls the ouija board. Well, I asked it if it was the past life of someone here, and it said Jacob.  We all laughed, and then everyone taunted us and laughed that we were lovers. We continued asking questions. Where did you die? California. How? Train wreck, it was planned. He said he payed someone to purposely cause the wreck because my past life was going to die and he did not want to be alone.
<br><br>
I asked what my past life name was, and it spelled &quot;EL...&quot; I automatically said Ellis, and Kyle pushed it the rest of the way to speed things up. Then is said &quot;V.&quot;  I went on talking to them and trying to get information. Well, we all left after a while and I was a little weirded out, but no harm done.
<br><br>
Kasey came over about one week later, and we asked it if we should look them up. So we searched the names and 1910 as their death. Nothing. So we asked Greg for more information. He said he had no middle name, but his nickname was Jimmy...his full name was Gregory Johnson.  We searched it, Gregory Johnson, California, 1910. Under death records...nothing.
<br><br>
Why is nothing coming up? And he said their bodies were never identified...so we searched by their births.  He said he was born in 1887 and she was born in 1890.  So we searched Gregory Johnson born, 1887.  One came up.  This is what we found on Rootsweb:
<br><br>
# Name:Gregory J JOHNSON<br>
# Sex: M<br>
# Birth: ABT 1889<br>
# Death: UNKNOWN<br>
# Reference Number: 230119
<br><br>
Notice the year says ABOUT and it is only 2 years off. Death is UNKNOWN and they were never identified. J as middle name when his nickname was Jimmy...
<br><br>
It took us a minute to see this at the bottom of the page, but it said:
<br><br>
Marriage 1 Elsie Virginia BROOKS b: 13 DEC 1890<br>
* Married: 9 MAY 1925 in Birmingham, AL<br>
<br>
So we were like...ELLIS...maybe she was trying to say that???!!!
<br><br>
So then we look her up...
<br><br>
# Name: Elsie Virginia BROOKS<br>
# Sex: F<br>
# Birth: 13 DEC 1890<br>
# Death: UNKNOWN<br>
# Reference Number: 230118<br>
<br>
Birth year is correct, death unknown...Virginia after she said &quot;V&quot;... I mean seriously.
<br><br>
But their marriage was wrong because they died in 1910. So we asked again when they died, only this time we asked Elsie.  She said 1944. Which would make sense. So we asked her about siblings. Two sisters. Marie and then the first initial &quot;L&quot;...Marie and Lillian Brooks were her sisters!!!! We found it on rootsweb too.
<br><br>
They claimed Jacob and I would fall in love...it is freaky. I really do like Jacob, and have since kindergarten...it's the same with him, but our friendship was in the way.  It was right.
<br><br>
I believe in ouija boards now. I know they are real...but I doubt they are evil. The chances of that stuff being a coincidence is SO SLIM. All that info was correct!
<br><br>
So is Elsie my past life?
<br><br>
Is Greg Jacob's?
<br><br>
Today we were bored, and Kasey and I were talking to him for the heck of it.  It was repeating her every word so she said &quot;Whats up?&quot; and it repeated it spelling it as W-A-S U-P.  She said that is not how she wrote it, and he said &quot;Teach me.&quot; So she moved it to spell &quot;Whazzup&quot; and he repeated it.  We decided to test it one more time...we got a recorder and asked him questions for an EVP.
<br><br>
We were joking around at times, and I said &quot;Can you say a sentence?&quot; And Kasey said, &quot;Can you say whazzup?&quot; Well, when we played it back only every once in a while did we hear anything that could maybe be a spirit...but when she asked that it said clearly in a whisper: &quot;Yes, whazzup.&quot;
<br><br>
It's creepy, but awesome...
<br><br>
It's all true and stuff.
