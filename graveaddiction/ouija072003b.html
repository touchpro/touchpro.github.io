On July 31, 2003 Amanda came over to my place for a &quot;contacting the dead&quot; session.  We ended up using two boards this night.  We talked to a lot of people that we had never talked to before.
<br><br>
We used the antique board from the 1960's second, this session lasted a little over 55 minutes.

On July 19, 2005 I received the following e-mail from Jon Haworth...it kinda freaked me out a little!
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I read your ouija experience with Elsie, and after a bit of digging I believe I found her death index:
<br><br>
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DEATH MASTER FILE<br>
Name: WILLIAMS, ELSIE L<br>
Date of Death: 7/21/1989<br>
Birthdate: 8/20/1902<br>
State/Country/Zip of Residence: VIRGINIA 22401<br><br>
What scared me the most is the year of birth matches what the board told you!&quot;</blockquote>
