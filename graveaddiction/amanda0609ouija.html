On June 16, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amanda J. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My boyfriend and I have been continuing to play with our board. We recently moved into a new home, and have been there about a month. We regularly speak with a spirit named Tom. He says he lives in the house because it makes him happy, and he died of a heart attack in 1983. We did some asking around and some research, and learned that a Tom did in fact live in our house with his wife and daughter in the 70s. We actually found a love letter in our one closet that looked like an elementary student wrote it, and it was addressed to Kelly (Tom's daughter).
<br><br>
Anyway, we were talking to Tom one night, and he wasn't being too talkative. I kept asking repeatedly for someone new to come through who wanted to talk with us. I normally ask for spirits to enter our home only if they mean us absolutely no harm. But this time I just asked for anyone who wants to speak with us. All of a sudden, the room got very cold. The planchette moved to the center of the board, and then began quickly jerking to letters:
<br><br>
Board: AZRAEL<br>
Me: Hello, is that your name?<br>
<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you from, Azrael?<br>
Board: Salem Evil<br>
<br>
Me: You are evil?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have the ability to show yourself to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you right now?<br>
Board: At the front door open it<br>
<br>
Me: You're at the front door?<br>
Board: No next to Jason (the other person playing)<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: Fire<br>
<br>
Me: You were in a fire?<br>
Board: Burned alive witch<br>
<br>
Me: You're a witch?<br>
Board: evil<br>
<br>
Me: Can you harm us?<br>
Board: Yes I will<br>
<br>
Jason: If you mean us harm, you are not welcome in our home. Goodbye!<br>
(Planchette jerks really quickly and firmly to &quot;goodbye.&quot; At that exact second, we heard a loud BOOM from upstairs. We went to check out what it was and all the shelves in our bathroom fell to the floor.)
<br><br>
The next day I googled the name Azrael because I'd never heard it before. It translates to &quot;Angel of Death&quot; in the Islamic religion.
