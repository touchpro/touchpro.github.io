I'm back!  Actually, I was back in Columbus by 6:11 this evening.  I was back to my place around 8:15 (had to go home with my parents who live 30 miles southeast of here since I left my truck at their place, then drive back to Columbus...I would have been home by 7:45 if I would have left the truck at my house!).<br /><br />New Orleans was a lot of fun.  My cousin's wedding was beautiful, and the crawfish boil his wife's family had for all of us the day after the wedding was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed walking around the French Quarter, as well as going on all the tours.  I deleted some of the photos after each tour, but I still have <b>780</b> photos to go through - I'm sure I won't be putting all of them on the site, but I figure I'll use well over half of them.  Cemeteries, swamps, plantations, alligators...they should make for exciting web updates!<br /><br />Since I've been on the go non-stop since arriving in New Orleans last Thursday, this will have to be a short entry.  I'll be going through my massive amounts of e-mail tomorrow, and I'll also stop by all of your blogs to catch up on everything I missed!  I'm also hoping to get some of the photos added to the site later this week...that shouldn't be a problem since I took the rest of the week off work :)<br /><br />Now I'm going to go and get some sleep!<br><br>

Another day closer to vacation!!  I'm not sure if you'll be hearing from me again this week, so this may be my last blog entry for a few days...I'm just so busy!  But never fear, I'll be blogging daily as soon as this whole New Orleans thing is over!<br /><br />Unfortunately I don't have anything too exciting to blog about.  It was another fun day at work.  Most of my time was spent moving...my entire department is moving to another floor so we've all been packing up our desks.  I spent some time having bizarre conversations with my coworkers too.  Bizarre conversations seem to happen quite frequently in this area.  For example, today I talked with Mark and Pat about &quot;Pet Turds&quot;.  It's a long, sort of confusing story so I won't go into the background.  Let's just say that when Pat and I were talking about using fake dog crap instead of hollow plastic rocks to hide spare keys, Mark wasn't listening and he thought we were talking about plastic pet turds.  The thought of small children playing with pet turds instead of pet rocks was <i>almost</i> enough to make me have another laughing fit like the one I had yesterday!  I wonder if stuff like that is what managers mean when they talk about us needing to have fun at work?  Probably not :)<br /><br />I went to Target tonight to buy some pantyhose since I'll need them to wear with the dress at the wedding...I hate hose, they always make my legs itch.  Oh well, at least I only have to wear them a few times a year, thank goodness our dress code at work is business casual attire!  Anyway, the hose are right beside the socks...and I couldn't resist, I just had to see if they had any cool socks.  I was in luck, they had lots of wild and crazy patterns!  I ended up buying four pairs:<br /><br />1.  Bright yellow ankle socks with black polka dots<br />2.  Black socks with coral polka dots<br />3.  Gray socks with squiggley black, orange, coral, and dark gray stripes<br />4.  White socks with frogs, snails, butterflies, ladybugs, and caterpillars.  <br /><br />I just love crazy socks!<br><br>

I wasn't too thrilled with the What's On...Right Now question (my usual Wednesday meme), so I decided to answer the <a href="http://wednesday.fiare.net/" target="_blank">Wednesday Whatevers</a> instead:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>What are your views on pornography?</b><br><br>I'm not into it, but if other people want to watch it they should be allowed...as long as it doesn't involve children.  I'm totally against child porn.<br><br><br /><li><b>What would you like done to your body when you die?</b><br><br>I always thought I wanted to be cremated, but I decided being buried would be more fun.  I don't <i>just</i> want to be buried though...I want a very simple gravestone with a creepy epitaph carved on it (I haven't come up with the epitaph yet), that way people will probably start making up stories about my grave being haunted.  I think that would be really cool!<br><br><br /><li><b>Would you rather eat your tongue or your hand?</b><br><br>This is a tough question.  I guess I'd rather eat my hand - my left hand to be specific.  I'm right-handed, so if I ate my left hand I'd still be able to write, etc.  I definitely wouldn't want to eat my tongue, I'd really miss not being able to talk.<br /></ol><br><br>

I REALLY need to work on a website update tomorrow night!  I totally meant to do it tonight, but got sidetracked.  I guess I could use the excuse of adding tagboards to both my blog and <a href="./solstice/index.html" target="_blank">Kate's blog</a>, but that's really a terrible excuse since that took all of 4-5 minutes. Of course, maybe if I hadn't told you how long it took it'd be a decent excuse...damn, I should have kept my mouth shut! :)<br /><br />Well, I lost it at work today.  No, I didn't get angry with anyone or anything serious like that...I had a laughing fit!  Now I laugh all the time, but this afternoon was one of the rare times that I laughed so hard I was crying and couldn't talk.  I'm sure it won't seem as funny as it would if you were actually there, but here's what happened.  One of my coworkers has been kinda down lately.  He was telling us that the <i>only</i> thing that has cheered him up and kept him going the past few months is watching Dukes of Hazzard reruns.  He elaborated on that, which was pretty amusing.  But what really got me was when I started thinking...I'm friends with this guy, and I've gone over to his house several times while he's been in a depressed mood.  I even took <a href="./solstice/index.html" target="_blank">Kate</a> over to his place with me just last month.  But the Dukes reruns have been the only good, positive thing in his life?  Now how do you think that made me feel?!?!?!?!?!  That was a worse slam than calling me bizarre (like he did a couple weeks ago)...it made it sound like the Dukes are more important than my friendship!  Just thinking about it was enough to make me start laughing.  When I tried to tell this guy and the other two coworkers talking with us what I was laughing about I couldn't...everytime I tried to open my mouth I started to laugh harder!  I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at work!  Well, maybe the time in my old area when Lina misheard Joe and thought he said that I only watch porn movies, that was pretty funny too.  You know, porn/horror...they sound alike, right?!<br /><br />Anyway, the rest of my day was pretty uneventful.  I did go to lunch with a couple coworkers, pizza buffet at Iaccono's is awesome.  And it was nice to finally go to lunch with my new coworkers...it seems like every other time they go I have lunch plans with my friends in IAS.  <br /><br />I think I'm going to go and do some more packing...I hate waiting til the last minute, so I always start early.  The New Orleans trip is getting closer and closer, I can't wait!!!!<br><br>

My answers to the <a href="http://www.captive-heart.com/TT.html" target="_blank">Tuesday Twosome</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>&quot;pop&quot; or &quot;soda&quot;?</b><br><br>I grew up saying pop, so I'll stick with that.  But I don't have to worry about whether to call it soda or pop since I rarely drink it!<br><br><br /><li><b>chocolate or vanilla?</b><br><br>Vanilla, unless you're talking about white chocolate...white chocolate is my favorite :)<br><br><br /><li><b>potato or rice?</b><br><br>Definitely rice, I'm really not a big fan of potatoes.<br><br><br /><li><b>coffee or tea?</b><br><br>Yuck, I hate coffee!

First, my answers to the <a href="http://www.simplyjeanne.com/brunch/index.htm" target="_blank">Sunday Brunch</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you get a spring break?</b><br><br>No, my next official work holiday is Memorial Day.  I am going on vacation soon though, so I guess that might count as a spring break.<br><br><br /><li><b>Some of us are pretty casual about spring cleaning. Others go to it with a lot of gusto. Which are you?</b><br><br>I clean with a lot of gusto every week, I have no need for an &quot;official&quot; spring cleaning.<br><br><br /><li><b>Is planting flowers or a vegetable garden on the agenda?</b><br><br>Oh yes, definitely!  I'll be planting lots of herbs, flowers, and hot peppers (habaneros, chili, jalapenos, etc) as soon as it gets warm enough.  I'm planning on planting lots of unusual plants this year, I'm sure that I'll be posting lots of photos...you've now been warned!<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you suffer from allergies and do they get worse in the spring?</b><br><br>I never had problems with allergies when I was younger, but once I hit 22 something changed.  And yes, my allergies do get worse in the spring, but summer is the worst.<br><br><br /><li><b>How will you celebrate Easter this year?</b><br><br>I may go down to my parents' place for dinner.  Or I may go cemetery exploring, it just depends on the weather.  My family doesn't do anything really special for Easter. <br /></ol><br />I can't believe I forgot to blog yesterday...I broke my blogging streak!  Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter since there will be a longer break coming up soon...it's almost time for the New Orleans trip!!  I'm really excited, it'll be nice to have some time off work.  And just imagine all the cool photos I'll have for the site!  Hmmm, having new content to post on a website probably isn't something most people get excited about when going on vacation...yeah, I'm obsessed, what can I say?!  <br /><br />Speaking of the site, I'll probably be making an update sometime this week.  It's been a couple weeks since my last update, which is bad since I try to update weekly.  I don't know if I'll be adding many new photos, but I do have some interesting info to add to the <a href="patters.html">Williamsville Cemetery</a> and <a href="mjcem.html">Mary Jane's Grave</a> pages.  I love it when site visitors e-mail me stories/facts to add to the site!  A really nice visitor also sent me some pics from Gettysburg, I'll be posting those too.  And sometime next week or the week after will be a gigantic update of New Orleans stuff!!  I'm sure you can't tell I'm excited about this trip :)<br /><br />I feel like I'm forgetting something that I wanted to write about.  Oh well, if I remember later perhaps I'll log back in and write more!<br /><br />  <br><br>

March Madness...I can tell you this much, &quot;madness&quot; is a perfect word to describe the traffic around downtown Columbus!  I don't live far from downtown and Nationwide Arena, so there was no way for me to avoid the traffic tonight.  I can't wait until all the NCAA stuff is over!<br /><br />It hasn't been an overly exciting night.  I might my parents for dinner, then I went to look at fish for the aquarium.  I tested the water, and everything seemed OK.  The plecos are doing great, so I decided it'd be safe to add some new fish.  I've decided to go with tetras this time - so far I have a few Black Skirt Tetras, Red Eyed Tetras, and Bleeding Heart Tetras.  Oh, and I almost forgot...a couple cory cats since my plecos don't do the greatest job at keeping them bottom of the tank clean.  I can't complain about the cute little plecos though, they keep the sides of the tank perfectly clean of algae.  The new fish are so much smaller than the cichlids!!  They're really adorable though, I could sit and watch them swim for hours.  As much as I complain about the fish tank, I think I would miss it.  <br /><br />I do have a few interesting links to share tonight...<br /><br />My coworker Pat sent me a couple good political links today...I'm not sure about everyone else, but I know <a href="http://straightmute.blogspot.com">Wes</a> will enjoy them!  Here are the links:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108_2/pdfs_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_on_the_record_rep.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108_2/pdfs_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_on_the_record_rep.pdf</a><br /><li><a href="http://www.moveon.org/censure/caughtonvideo/" target="_blank">http://www.moveon.org/censure/caughtonvideo/</a><br /></ul><br />The last link I have to share with you is just a fun one...thanks to <a href="http://houseofslug.brendoman.com" target="_blank">Luis at House of Slug</a> for sharing this one: <a href="http://www.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijk.com" target="_blank">The World's Longest Alphabetical Email Address</a>.

My answers to this week's <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a>:<br /><br /><b>If you...</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?</b><br><br>Definitely Mexican!  Not only is it my favorite, but most of the entrees aren't too difficult to make.<br><br><br /><li><b>...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?</b><br><br>I'd sell antiques.  Having an antique store would be a really good excuse to go to auctions and flea markets all the time.  Of course, not having a good excuse doesn't stop me from going all the time in the spring, summer, and fall!<br><br><br /><li><b>...wrote a book, what genre would it be?</b><br><br>Horror/Suspense<br><br><br /><li><b>...ran a school, what would you teach?</b><br><br>I think it'd be fun to start &quot;Beth's School of Ghost Hunting&quot;! :)  If I taught in a real school though, I'd want to teach history.<br><br><br /><li><b>...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?</b><br><br>Well, I can guarantee you that I will never, ever be recording an album...I admit I can't sing!  But if I could, I'd record a rock album...of course, if it was like the stuff I usually listen to I wouldn't have to be able to sing, I could just scream :)  I guess I could always just record an instrumental album.  I did write a song once, back in my high school Music Theory class.  Now I'm curious, I'll have to see if I still have it. I bet I have a copy of it in my tenor sax case.  <br /></ol><br><br>

I'm having a difficult time thinking of something to write about today, but I feel like I really should post something since I've been on a really good blogging streak lately! I'd hate to break it today :)  I thought about answering the 3x Thursday questions, but they were all about St. Patrick's day.  Since it's not one of my favorite holidays I have decided to skip those questions.<br /><br />Today wasn't the most exciting day at work.  Same old stuff, with the exception of lunch.  I met two of my friends from my old department, Kitty and Lina.  I had talked with them in passing since we do work at the same building, but this was the first time since I left the area at the beginning of February that I had a chance to really talk with them.  It was a lot of fun!  I'm now caught up on all the gossip/news about my former coworkers.  And we went to Chili's....yum, southwestern eggrolls.  It's Lina's fault I'm hooked on those, she's the one who talked me into trying them!  I'm glad she did though :)<br /><br />I'm glad the work week is almost over, for some reason I've been really tired every single day this week.  It will be so nice to be able to sleep in!  <br><br>

First, my answer to today's <a href="http://whatsonnow.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">What's On...Right Now</a>:<br /><br /><b>What's On <u>your agenda for St. Patrick's Day</u> Right Now?</b><br /><br />First thing on my agenda is getting ready for work.  Then it's the same old stuff...go to work (where I'll go to meetings and work on test plans).  Then after work I need to do my laundry and clean the apartment a little since my sister will be spending the night tomorrow.  I might stop at Petsmart tonight and look at fish too (I've been thinking about getting Oscars this time).  But that's about all I have planned!<br /><br />Looks like the serial shootings around Columbus might finally be over!!!  They caught the number one suspect in Las Vegas last night - you can read about it by <a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com/serialshootings/2928068/detail.html" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.  <br><br>

<b><a href="http://www.sturho.com/" target="_blank">Happy Saint Urho's Day</a>!!!</b><br /><br />Never heard of Saint Urho?  You're not alone, I didn't know the story until I received the <a href="http://www.almanac.com/index.php" target="_blank">Old Farmer's Almanac</a> newsletter in my inbox this afternoon!  Here's the brief description from the newsletter:<br /><br /><blockquote>* St. Urho's Day (March 16)<br /><br />The legend of St. Urho began in northern Minnesota in the 1950s and grew among Finnish-Americans to the point where he is now known across the United States and Canada, and even in Finland. The legend says that St. Urho chased the grasshoppers out of ancient Finland, thus saving the grape crop and the jobs of Finnish vineyard workers. His feast is celebrated by wearing royal purple and nile green.</blockquote><br />From visiting <a href="http://www.sturho.com/" target="_blank">www.sturho.com</a> (which I highly recommend!) I learned that he chased the grasshoppers out by saying the phrase &quot;Hein‰sirkka, hein‰sirkka, mene t‰‰lt‰ hiiteen&quot;, which is roughly translated &quot;Grasshopper, grasshopper, go to Hell&quot;.  That sounds similar to what my sister says every summer when we walk through the fields around my parents' house...she hates grasshoppers!!  Now if I could only find the story of a saint who drove spiders out of an entire country...I'd pray to that saint everyday! <br /><br />My friend Kate's blog is now up and running...I recommend checking it out by <a href="./solstice/index.html" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.  I really love the fact that I've talked two of my friends into starting blogs, it's an easy way to stay updated on everything happening with them!  Actually, I didn't talk Kate starting one, she asked me if I'd help her start one months ago :)<br /><br />The drive into work SUCKED this morning.  I-270 was a nightmare, and I-670 wasn't much better.  I was only two minutes late though, I was impressed that I wasn't later (of course, I did leave a bit earlier than usual).  It took my coworker Mike a little over two hours to make it in from Ashville.  That's more than double what it usually takes!  I was relieved that most of the snow had been cleared or had melted by the time I left work tonight...the drive home was no different than usual.    <br /><br />Well, I think that's it for tonight...if I think of anything else, I'll log back in and blog some more :)<br /><br><br>

Nice, it's snowing like crazy outside...I can tell it's going to be a <i>fun</i> trip into work.  I'll be sure to blog about it tonight.<br /><br />Anyway, here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.captive-heart.com/TT.html" target="_blank">Tuesday Twosome</a>:<br /><br /><b>Spring is finally here!</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>What two things you enjoy about Spring?</b><br><br>Warmer (but not hot) weather and being able to start working in the garden. <br><br><br /><li><b>What two things are you going to miss about Winter?</b><br><br>Cool/Cold weather and...well, I can't think of anything else!  I'm definitely NOT going to miss the snow. <br><br> <br /><li><b>Spring Cleaning: &quot;Of course, I get to clean out my house.&quot; or &quot;Nope. What's the point? It's going to get dirty again anyway.&quot;</b><br><br>I don't do official spring cleaning, but I'm constantly cleaning out the house since I'm a bit obsessive compulsive about cleaning.<br><br><br /><li><b>Spring Flowers: &quot;Tulips and all flowers are blooming. I love this time of the year!&quot; or &quot;Allergy season is kickin' in. Pollen! Enough already.&quot;</b><br><br>I absolutely love looking at my garden in the spring to see which bulbs and perennials are coming up.  But all the pollen is hell on my allergies.  Oh well, being outside is worth sneezing a little!<br><br><br /><li><b>Spring weather in you area means: &quot;Outside activities!&quot; or &quot;It is still freakin' cold! I am going to be inside, thank you!&quot;</b><br><br>Around here it could mean either, the weather changes day to day!  <br /></ol><br /><br><br>

Thanks to <a href="http://straightmute.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Wes</a>, I have discovered the <a href="http://www.churchsigngenerator.com/index.php" target="_blank">Church Sign Generator</a>.  This is just way too much fun, I'll have to share it with some of my friends at work tomorrow :)<br /><br />My day at work went fast, I love days like that.  Nothing too exciting happened.  I heard about the bowling party that my coworkers had last Friday.  Although it sounds like the bowling party was a lot of fun, I still think my Friday night was a bit more interesting!  I <strike>should</strike> will be able to make it to the next work outing...my team (all five of us) are going to meet up for pizza, beer, and the Dukes of Hazzard at Mark's place sometime next month!!!  Since Mark and I told our other coworkers what a fun time Kate and I had a couple weeks ago, they decided they wanted to have a Dinner & Dukes experience at Mark's place too.  I'm glad I have such a cool team :)<br /><br />Ugh, my arms are so sore today.  It's my own fault, I was the idiot who decided to carry that heavy stereo into the apartment by myself on Saturday.  My dad helped me carry it down the steps and helped me load it into the back of my truck.  It's bigger than it looks in the photos, and it's HEAVY!  Since he didn't think I would be able to unload it and carry it into the apartment by myself, my parents decided to come up to my place for dinner.  I got a 10-15 minute head start though, so I beat them there.  I felt bad about making my dad lift that heavy stereo for me, so I decided I'd try to get it into the house by myself.  I succeeded in doing so, but now I regret waiting for them to get there and help.  My arms are so stiff that I just want to scream when I move them.  They were a little sore yesterday, but they're way worse today.  Hopefully they'll be better tomorrow.  <br /><br />Enough whining about my sore muscles!  So far the only people I've heard from regarding the ouija gathering are Kate and <a href="http://straightmute.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Wes</a>.  Kate and I discussed next Monday, but since my vacation is getting so close, next week might not be too great for me.  So if no one can meet up this week,  how about a date April 1 or after?  Let me know what you think!  Once I get a couple more suggestions I'll post a poll so you can all vote!<br /><br />I know it's only 8:30, but I'm quite tired.  Maybe that's due to the fact that I couldn't fall asleep last night?  I think it was around 2:30 before I finely managed to fall asleep (I remember seeing 2:23AM on the clock). So that means I'm running on about 3 hours of sleep.  I'm too old to stay up late like that anymore :)  <br /><br><br>

Let's get this out of the way first...my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.simplyjeanne.com/brunch/index.htm" target="_blank">Sunday Brunch</a>:<br /><br /><b>What's in a Name?</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you like your name?</b><br><br>No, not really.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Beth, it's just way too common.  I think it'd be cool to have a more unique name.<br><br><br /><li><b>Are you named after anyone?</b><br><br>No, my parents just liked the name. <br><br><br /><li><b>Do you have a nickname? If yes, what is it?</b><br><br>Well, Beth is a nickname since my name is really Elizabeth.  But as some of you may remember from one of last week's memes, I have several others: Evil B, Bad Beth, Queen of Darkness, Luci..., Bethie, and Bethers.<br><br><br /><li><b>If you could change your name, what would you change it to?</b><br><br>Hmmm, even though I don't like my name I've never really thought about this!  I kinda like the name Mahala, it was my great-great-grandma's name.  <br><br><br /><li><b>What is the most interesting name of your friends or someone you know?</b><br><br>I knew a girl when I was in elementary school named Chrisonna.  She was one of my 4-H Camp counselors.  Her name was a combination of her parents' names, Chris and Donna.<br /></ol><br />I started shopping for upholstery/tapestry fabric today.  I went to JoAnn, and they had tons of different patterns...but not a single pattern similar to the original I am trying to replace.  So for the time being I bought a gold-beige colored fabric.  I bought remnants that they had thrown out on clearance super cheap.  I'll post pictures of the temporary fabric in a couple seconds.  I think I'm going to talk to the guy who's refinishing my mom's rocking chair.  She told me that this guy has a lot of antique-looking fabrics to choose from.  So when she picks up her chair in about 2.5 weeks, I'm going to go with her and see if he has anything.  OK, enough...here are a couple new pictures:<br /><center><br />Radio with the new fabric on the top door:<br /><img src="./miscpic/radio8.jpg"><br /><br />Closer pic of the new (temporary) fabric:<br /><img src="./miscpic/radio7.jpg"><br /></center><br />A note to all of my friends here in Central Ohio reading this - we need to get together for another Ouija party at my place.  I always like to use the board after bringing a new object home from my great-grandparents'/great-uncle's place since it always seems to stir up the paranormal activity.  Maybe some night after work this week or next?  I'm OK with any night except Thursday.  I'll even provide food and beverages...comment or e-mail me if you like the idea!<br /><br />Hmmm, I can't think of anything else interesting to write about.  I'm sure I'll have stuff to write about tomorrow!<br><br>

Oh no...I almost ruined my blogging-on-a-regular-basis streak!  Luckily I remembered that I needed to post something before the day was over...<br /><br />I'm not going to be answering a meme today, mainly because I forgot to look for a good Saturday one.  Maybe I'll find one in time for next week.<br /><br />I had a great time last night with Kate, Chrissie, Susan, Jos, Chris, and Bruce.  It was a different night, that's for sure...we went to a wide variety of places in just one night.  The night started out a Skully's in the Short North for happy hour, then it was off to dinner at Figlio's in Grandview.  After dinner we went to the Lennox to see a movie.  We had planned on seeing Big Fish, but unfortunately it wasn't playing.  So instead we saw Eurotrip.  It wasn't too bad, there were some funny parts.  Then to wrap up the night we went to Outland.  I finally went home around 2AM.  Considering that I was at work early on Friday (ugh, I was there by 6AM!) I did a pretty impressive job at staying awake...I get tired much sooner than I did when I was younger!   Anyway, I was up early this morning too, so right now I'm so tired that I feel like I could collapse :)<br /><br />So why am I still awake instead of sleeping soundly in my bed you ask?  Because I was working on my new &quot;Oh my god, that's junk!!!&quot; fix-it-up project.  It's an old stereo/record player that's in a big wooden cabinet.  It's old, but I'm not sure how old...it's a 78 RPM record player, and my dad said the stereo is really old too since it uses tubes (or something like that, I'm bad at radio terminology).  It belonged to my great-grandparents.  We're guessing it's from the late 1930's - early 1950's.  I don't know if it still works, I haven't tried plugging it in since the cords look really scary (I don't want to start a fire or anything!).  I'm going to post pictures so you can see, but it was really filthy and it had some scratches and chips.  No one else in the family wanted it, so I got to take it...I love trying to fix up vintage &quot;junk&quot;.  I really didn't need another old stereo/record player...I have an old record player from my grandma's house from the 1970's.  That one is in a cabinet too, it's really long and I have it sitting in my hallway to use as a table.  I get compliments on it all the time since it looks really cool where I put it...and just think, the family was planning to throw that one away too!  I also have an old stereo cabinet that my mom bought in the 1970's.  It has a record player (I don't have a needle for it, but I think it still works), a stereo (with awesome bass!), and...get this...an 8-track player!!!  The 8-track still works, I play some of them every now and then, just for fun.  Anyway, I'm rambling AGAIN!  Back to the new addition...I cleaned it up tonight and repaired some of the scratches and chips in the wood.  I also re-attached the door for the compartment with the record player.  I'm going to use this as a replacement for my old bookcase in the living room.  The wood on the stereo matches my living room furniture.  The old bookcase didn't match at all!  Enough with all this talk...let me show you a few pictures:<br /><br /><center>Radio before cleaning:<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio6.jpg"><br /><br />Before - Stereo:<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio5.jpg"><br /><br />Before - Record Player:<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio4.jpg"><br /><br />Cool looking lion door handles:<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio3.jpg"><br /><br />After cleaning and re-attaching the door (btw, that's the newspaper article I mentioned framing earlier this week...it's on the right):<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio2.jpg"><br /><br />Closer After picture:<br /><br /><img src="./miscpic/radio1.jpg"><br /></center><br />Tomorrow I need to start looking for some new upholstery fabric to recover the record player door.  The old fabric has dry-rotted and it's starting to shred.  I have a feeling it may take awhile before I find the perfect fabric...Yeah, I'm picky :)  I'll post more pictures after it's totally finished.  I had so much fun working on it tonight, it's the little things that make me happy!<br /><br />Well, I need to go and clean up the mess I made.  I have about 1,384,393,849 dirty dust rags to gather up and throw away before I can call it a night and get some sleep!<br><br>

My answers to this week's <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>What was the last song you heard?</b><br><br>I heard &quot;Realign&quot; by Godsmack on the radio while I was backing the truck into a parking space.<br><br><br /><li><b>What were the last two movies you saw?</b><br><br>The last two movies I watched on DVD were <i>School of Rock</i> and <i>Secondhand Lions</i>.  The last two movies I saw in the theater were <i>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</i> and (I think) <i>Finding Nemo</i>.  I don't go to see movies in the theatre very often, I only go if it's something I really want to see (or if one of my friends really wants to see it).<br><br><br /><li><b>What were the last three things you purchased?</b><br><br>Ick/Parasite treatment for the fish, dinner for my sister last night, and a picture frame.<br><br><br /><li><b>What four things do you need to do this weekend?</b><br><br>Well, tonight I'm going out with some of my friends, tomorrow I'm going down to my parents' place, I need to do something about the aquarium now that I managed to kill all of the cichilds (I'll explain later), and I need to get another update ready for the site.<br><br><br /><li><b>Who are the last five people you talked to?</b><br><br>My mom, my sister, Chrissie, and probably Mark (I can't remember who the last person I talked to at work was yesterday, so I'm guessing it was him).  That's not counting all the people I &quot;talked&quot; with on AIM last night!<br /></ol><br />I said I'd explain the fish murdering...each morning I'd wake up to find at least one dead cichlid in the aquarium.  I noticed that they had little white crystal like things on them, which is a symptom of ick.  Ick is a disease fish get when they experience stress...probably the major water change I did last weekend!  Anyway, I ran to Petco since it's the closest pet store and bought some ick treatment.  It's just these little tabs that you drop in the tank, one for every ten gallons.  The remaining fish seemed really active and happy after I treated the aquarium last night.  However, when I looked this morning ALL of the cichlids were laying at the bottom all bloated and drained of color.  It was pretty disgusting.  The plecos seem to be doing just fine though.  So yeah, now the water is all cloudy from the dead fish, and it kinda smells.  So I'll probably have to do something about that this weekend.<br /><br />But now I need to get ready for work.  Hopefully the day will go fast!<br><br>

OK, I feel like I've really accomplished something these past couple nights.  I didn't get around to making a site update this week, but I did help two people set up new blogs!  Last night I helped my friend Chrissie set up hers, you can see it by <a href="http://sillinesss.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.  While I was testing out her new template, I noticed someone had already posted a comment to my test entry.  The girl told Chrissie how much she liked the layout, and she mentioned that she could use some help with her new blog.  So being the nice (and modest, right?!) person that I am, I offered to help.  I finished the template a couple minutes ago.  I don't think Emerica has changed the template yet, but I think she's planning to change it sometime tonight....<a href="http://www.wrenispinkle.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">click here</a> to see her blog.  <br /><br />My sister just got back from class a few minutes ago, so I think I'm going to sign off and go talk with her since Thursday night is the only time I get to see her each week.  Well, I guess that's not fair to say, occasionally she does stay home on the weekends, so if I go down to my parents' house I see her then.  <br /><br />I'll blog again tomorrow...so far I've only missed one day this week :) <br><br>

I like my current job a lot.  Hahaha, I do wear a lot of hats at work...but not as many as I did in my old area.  One of my former managers used to use the phrase &quot;put on your business analyst hat&quot; all the time, it was terrible :)<br><br><br /><li><b> Do you get along with your co-workers?

I should be in bed by now, but even though I'm totally exhausted I can't manage to fall asleep.  So instead of tossing and turning, I decided to blog!<br /><br />Have I mentioned that I really love my new job?  Yeah, probably about 10,000 times :)  Actually, I guess it's probably not all that new anymore, I've been there for a little over a month now.  <br /><br />I think my coworkers are part of the reason I like working in this area so much.  They're a ton of fun!  For example, my friend and one again coworker Mark (I worked with him 3.5 years ago before I started in my old area) has been really depressed lately.  His girlfriend broke up with him a month or two ago, and he hasn't been the same since.  He's been trying to meet people online, but he hasn't had much luck.  Anyway, yesterday Pat (another coworker) and I were talking to him about meeting people.  Pat came up with a <i>fabulous</i> idea to help make Mark more appealing to women...he suggested turning him into &quot;Superfly Mark&quot;!!!  We came up with lots of cool attire suggestions, and even ideas on how to turn the &quot;Brown Beast&quot;, one of his old cars, into a pimp-mobile!  And Pat is taking this seriously (no, not <i>really</i> seriously!) and even found Mark the PERFECT hat for his new look: <a href="http://www.pimphats.com/pimphatsdotcom_2004_sdred.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pimphats.com/pimphatsdotcom_2004_sdred.htm</a>.  Pretty cool, huh?!  <br /><br />Anyway, I think that's about all for tonight.  I'll be blogging again tomorrow, I've gotta answer the questions from the new Thursday meme I selected!<br /><br /><br><br>

As you have probably figured out, I'm trying to find a meme to start each day of the week with...I think that might motivate me to blog on daily basis.  So for Wednesday, I've decided to try <a href="http://whatsonnow.blogspot.com/" TARGET="blank">What's On...Right Now</a>.  It's only one question a week, I can deal with that!<br /><br /><b>This week's What's On...Right Now question: What's On the back seat of your car Right Now?</b><br /><br />Right now there is an umbrella and a coat laying on the back seat.  And there might be an ice scraper, I can't remember since sometimes I lay it on the seat and other times I put in under the seat.<br /><br />I'm really tired again today.  I've been having weird dreams lately, and I think that's caused my sleep to be restless.  At least the dreams haven't been nightmares...but they've been <i>really</i> bizarre.  Bizarre, that's a pretty cool word.  I don't use that word often, but I've been using it quite a bit lately since I've heard it a couple times.  Mark, a friend/coworker, has called me bizarre twice since Friday.  On Friday he called me that because of my religious beliefs.  And yesterday he called me bizarre because of the weird socks I wear.  I can't help it, I just can't wear plain white socks!  In fact, I don't think I've worn solid colored socks since high school :)  You can ask any of my friends from high school, I'm sure they'd all remember my strange socks!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rambling.  I need to go and read a couple other blogs now, especially <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jostyrus/" target="_blank">Jos's blog</a>.  Why is it so important that I read his blog??  I need to find out how his date with my friend Chrissie went last night!!!      <br><br>

I found a new meme for Tuesday - <a href="http://www.captive-heart.com/TT.html" target="_blank">The Tuesday Twosome</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you put both your socks on then your shoes or do you put on sock, then shoe, then go to other leg and put on sock then shoe?</b><br><br>I always put both of my socks on first, then both of my shoes.<br><br><br /><li><b>When you button your shirt/blouse, do you start at the bottom buttons or start from the top?</b><br><br>I always start from the top, I don't think I've ever started buttoning from the bottom<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you put your deodorant on before or after you put your clothes on?</b><br><br>I always try to put my deodorant on before my clothes...however, I usually end up putting it on both before and after putting on my clothes.  See, I tend to be a bit paranoid/obsessive compulsive about a lot of things, and deodorant is one of them.  Chances are I did remember to put it on before my clothes, but I always manage to freak myself out wondering &quot;Oh no, what if I forgot?!&quot;...so I usually put it on twice!<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you floss before or after you brush your teeth?</b><br><br>Flossing?  What's that?  Just kidding, but I do hate flossing so I don't do it as much as a should.  When I do floss though (a few times a week), I do it after brushing my teeth.<br><br><br /><li><b>You are out to eat and spill sauce on your light-colored shirt/blouse, do you try to get it out and just decide to let it be, or do you go and buy a new shirt/blouse because it is too embarrassing?</b><br><br>This is a situation I'm in way too often, I'm cursed when it comes to dropping stuff on my shirt while eating out.  Thankfully I almost always wear dark clothes.  I think I only own two or three shirts that aren't black, navy blue, charcoal, hunter green, or burgundy :)  Anyway, I've never gone out and bought a new shirt to change into right away...I try to clean it up as best as I can, and then just deal with a stain on my shirt until I get home.<br /></ol><br />I didn't blog yesterday because it wasn't an overly exciting day.  Another great day at work, it's so wonderful to have a job I actually enjoy again!  <br /><br />After work I went to JoAnn to buy a picture frame for an old newspaper article I found in one of my great-uncle's old letters...it's an article from 1941 about the progress of military aviation.  It's pretty cool framed, perhaps I'll try taking a picture of it for the blog.  I also bought a couple new photo albums for my postcard collection.  <br /><br />I ended the night by (finally) doing my taxes and my laundry.  I'll be getting a refund again, that's always exciting!  <br /><br />Well, it's time for me to get ready for work.  I'm soooo tired today, here's hoping I make it through my 7.75 hours without falling asleep! :)<br /><br><br>

First, my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.simplyjeanne.com/brunch/index.htm" target="_blank">Sunday Brunch</a>:<br /><br /><b>Topic: I Don't Wanna Grow Up</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you watch cartoons?</b><br><br>No, I hardly watch any TV.<br><br><br /><li><b>Ever buy a box of cereal (for yourself) just for the prize inside?</b><br><br>I haven't bought cereal other than oatmeal for a long time!  But I do think the prizes are fun, and if I ever saw a prize that I really, really wanted I wouldn't think twice about buying a box simply for the toy inside!<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you ever go to the playground to play on the swings, slide or teeter totter?</b><br><br>Yeah, I've been known to play on the swings when it's warm outside!<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you occasionally pout, throw tantrums or cry to get what you want?</b><br><br>I've done the pouting thing a couple times, but not often.<br><br><br /><li><b>How long has it been since you've done something childlike (for example: ride a bike, play marbles, jump rope, build a sand castle)?</b><br><br>God, I honestly can't remember the last time I've done something childlike, unless you count playing games with my friends' kids.  Most of my spare time is spent doing what I <i>really</i> enjoy, which is walking around cemeteries or historical places.<br /></ol><br />It's been a pretty uneventful weekend for me.  Same old stuff, so I won't bore you with writing about it.  I am pretty happy that all of the fish are still alive and doing fine after the drastic tank cleaning.  I always worry that the clean water will be too big of a shock for them. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm sure I'll have plenty to write about tomorrow.  Hope you all had a great weekend!!<br /><br><br>

I was invited to go bowling with two different groups of friends tonight, but I declined both invitations.  Was I doing something better than bowling?  Not even close!  However I decided that I needed to be responsible, so instead I stayed home and <b>really</b> cleaned the aquarium.  I think this is the hundredth time I've cleaned it the past two weeks.  Ever since Kathy died the algae has been out of control, and the aquarium has smelled terrible.  Carol died a week after I bought her, but little Ben has really started to grow.  He's still pretty tiny though.  So tonight I bought two more plecos (Jeff and Heather), hopefully a couple more will help the tank out.  I removed all of the fish tonight and replaced some of the gravel.  I also scraped the algae of the sides and put in a new aquarium ornament.  It's called &quot;Forgotten Ruins&quot; or something like that, it's an old castle.  I really like it.  The aquarium looks so nice now, and the fish seem much happier and active.  It took at least two hours to clean it, but I think it was worth it!  If nothing else, at least the living room doesn't stink anymore!  And hopefully I won't have to clean it again anytime soon!!!<br /><br />Now I think I'm going to go and shower...I smell like the dirty fish tank, yuck!<br><br>

I can't believe I forgot to answer the <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a> in the entry I posted earlier!!<br /><br /><b>What was...</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b> ...your first grade teacher's name?</b><br><br>Mrs. Kruse.  She really didn't like my friends and I much, and it showed.  So since my friends and I knew she had bad allergies, we'd go outside at recess and pick dandelions for her.  She didn't want to reprimand us since it was a nice gesture, so she's put them in a vase on a ledge high above her desk.  Guess I've always been bad, and that's probably how I got nicknames like Bad Beth, Evil B, and Luci... :) <br><br><br /><li><b> ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?</b><br><br>When I was a kid I loved Thunder Cats, He-Man, and She-Ra.  I really liked Eek the Cat too!<br><br><br /><li><b> ...the name of your very first best friend?</b><br><br>Erin was my first <i>really</i> best friend, I met her in kindergarten.  Our parents would drive us to each other's houses to play with our My Little Ponies.  But before her, I was best friends with Nick and Jeff in my preschool classes for two years.  The three of us got into trouble a lot (bet ya can't imagine that after my answer to question #1!).<br><br><br /><li><b> ...your favorite breakfast cereal?</b><br><br>I'm not a big cereal fan, but if I had to choose one I'd pick Rice Krispies.<br><br><br /><li><b> ...your favorite thing to do after school?</b><br><br>I used to like playing outside with my sister after school.  We spent most of our time playing outside.  Do kids do that anymore, or do they just stay inside and play video games?!<br /></ol><br><br>

Wow, I've really been neglecting this poor blog recently!  I just haven't seemed to have time to sit down and post anything.  As my old roommate would have said, &quot;I'm just a girl on the go&quot;!  I'm not even going to try to do a day-to-day catch up post like I usually do when I haven't blogged for awhile, that would take forever.  Instead I'll just do a list of some of the more interesting things that have happened during the last two weeks:<br /><ul><br /><li>I'll start with helping John move his old mattress to Ryan's house on February 18, since that's pretty much where I left off.  We got the mattress to Ryan's place without any problems, although I was a little worried the whole drive there...I kept having visions of the mattress blowing out of the bed of the truck.  But luckily John and I did a fantastic job of tying it down.  As payment for our help, Ryan made us dinner.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but Ryan is an awesome cook!  He deep-fried chicken, and served it with salad, bread, mashed potatoes, corn, and cottage cheese.  Now, I'm sure I could have asked for something else to drink so I don't feel sorry for myself...when we went instead, John grabbed a beer for him and one for me.  I wasn't even finished with the first one when he gave me another one.  That was just about the time we were getting ready to eat.  Now since John, Ryan, and Andy were all drinking beer with their meal, I thought what the hell, why ask for something different, I'll just drink beer too!  Well, I have discovered that beer and mashed potatoes/gravy aren't one of my favorite combinations so I doubt I'll try that again :) <br><br><br /><li>The next day (yeah, I know...I said I wouldn't write a day-to-day post!) Andy invited me to an after work Happy Hour.  John and Ryan were there too, along with some of my new coworkers.  I had just planned on dropping by for an hour or two, but I ended up staying for over four!  I didn't end up leaving until 8:45-ish.  It was fun though!<br><br><br /><li>No rest for the wicked...the next night, Friday 2/20, Chrissie and Jennifer met at my place for dinner.  We went to Cap City, which is usually where Chrissie and I end up going when we meet up for dinner.  I hadn't seen either of them for a few months (we had just been talking via e-mail), which is pretty silly since we all live within 30 minutes of each other.  Dinner was a lot of fun, we had a ton to catch up on!  The coolest thing that happened involved the site though...I have business cards that I printed up for the site.  The cards have my name, e-mail address, and site address.  Oh, and I put little gravestones on them too :)  Anyway, I ended up leaving one of my cards and one of the pens that have my URL imprinted on it (yep, I'm obsessed with my site!!!) with the tip.  On our way out of the restaurant we I heard someone say &quot;hey, wait up!&quot;.  The three of us stopped, turned around and saw the waiter.  He asked whose card that was, so Jennifer and Chrissie started laughing and pointed at me.  Turns my creepy site was of interest to him, he's doing a documentary on The Ridges in Athens and had a bunch of questions for me!   He even gave me his card so we could e-mail each other.  That was pretty cool, definitely not something I have happen often.  I love it when the site gets attention!!! <br><br>After dinner we went back to my place and watched <i>Secondhand Lions</i>, which is a wonderful movie.  I think we all had a great night, we decided we'll have to try to get together more often.<br><br><br /><li>Let's see...the next &quot;exciting&quot; thing happened on February 24.  And I use the word &quot;exciting&quot; sarcastically, the events of Tuesday really just pissed me off.  On my way to work the dreaded <b>SERVICE ENGINE SOON</b> light came on.  It flashed three times, then stayed on steady.  It did go out for a couple minutes afterwards, but then it did the blinking/staying on steady thing again.  Since I was planning to do some traveling later that week I decided I better take it in.  So I ended up leaving work early to drop the truck off at the dealership in Lancaster, OH.  Poor Chuck had to stay there overnight.  The only really exciting thing that happened on Tuesday was going to Meijer with my sister after she picked me up from the dealership and buying those candy-coated Cadbury's chocolate eggs.  I'm addicted to those, it's the really only thing I like about Easter!  It's all my friend Tony's fault, I probably wouldn't have tried them if he hadn't raved on and on about how fabulous they were!!<br><br><br /><li>Wednesday morning, 2/25, I found out what was wrong with the truck.  There wasn't insulation on the A/C line, and the condensation from that line had been dripping.  The dripping eroded the distributor cap and rotor, which is the reason the Service Engine Soon light came on.  They also discovered that fuel injectors #4 and #5 were failing.  However, gas was still flowing through them, so they just recommended cleaning them for now...they'll probably need replaced in a year or two.  $120 vs. $422....yeah, I'll settle for cleaning them instead of replacing them!!  They also replaced the fuel filter.  And the last thing they needed to replace was the fan belt since it was starting to crack.  Oh, and I almost forgot...I had three recalls that they needed to fix, but nothing too major.  So I ended up paying $486 to get everything fixed.  I wasn't too thrilled about it, but stuff like that happens.<br><br>After I picked up the truck after work that night, I had to go to Fisher Catholic for another Alumni Newsletter meeting.  That newsletter eats up <b>A LOT</b> of my time!<br><br><br /><li>Now it's time to discuss my paranormal-filled weekend.  Let's start with Friday, 2/27.  At 10:00PM I went on my first ghost hunt with <a href="http://www.majda.net" target="_blank">MADJA</a>.  It was at a bike store in Clintonville.  I've already added the haunting info and pictures to the site, so if you want to know more details about it, <a href="bsource.html">click here</a>.   I had a fun time on the hunt, and I met a lot of interesting, nice people.  Hopefully I'll have the chance to go on more ghost hunting adventures with them this year!<br><br><br /><li>Saturday, 2/28, I made the pilgrimage to Mansfield, OH to discuss the <a href="malabar.html">Ceely Rose</a> haunting with Mark Jordan at <a href="malabar.html">Malabar Farm State Park</a>..  Mark wrote the <i>Ceely</i> play that the Mansfield Playhouse performed there last fall.  He had some pretty strange things happen while they were rehearsing the play, you can read about it by <a href="malabar.html">clicking here</a> to visit my Malabar Farm page.  Mark also told me about and visited a cemetery on the farm's property - <a href="olivet.html">click here</a> to see my photos from Olivet Cemetery.  I had a great time up there, Malabar Farm is a great place to visit.<br /></ul><br />Whew, I think I'm finally caught up.  I don't have anything too exciting to mention about this week, it's been sort of boring.  Wait......I lied!!!!!!!!!  How could I forget what I did on Tuesday?!?!?  Tuesday night my friend Kate and I went over to Mark's house (you know, my friend from work with all the <a href="carpasture.html">old cars</a>?) for &quot;Dinner and Dukes&quot;.  We ate pizza and watched reruns of the Dukes of Hazzard.  It was too funny!  <br /><br />And another think I almost forgot that's worth writing about.  Yesterday I had lunch with a friend from my old area, Michelle.  It was great to have lunch with her and gossip!  And she made me feel better, because it sounds like there are a few people in IAS who miss me.  I miss some of the people too, but I can't really say I miss my old job :)<br /><br />OK, I think that's it, you're all caught up. I'll try hard to be better about blogging next week!<br><br>
