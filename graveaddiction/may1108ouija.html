On November 2, 2008 I received an e-mail from May about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My latest experience with an Ouija board was pretty idiotic of  me. I should have told my friends that you're not supposed to play an Ouija board in a graveyard. But it was Halloween. They were like, come on May, let's just try it. So me, Noel, Darien, Dwayne, Rayanne, and Tanner all went to the graveyard in my small hometown-  Yorkton, Saskatchewan. I pulled out my Ouija board, and I said that only three of us should play at a time. I think Rayanne and Noel already knew that you were not supposed to play this in a graveyard, because they both looked nervous and these people are fearless. They both said no, so Tanner sat out and me, Darien, and Dwayne all played.
<br><br>
May: Is there anyone there?<br>
Ouija: yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.<br>
<br>
We took our hand off, and it stopped.  It seemed though that many spirits were trying to contact us.  Well duh, we were in a graveyard. I said we should stop, but Darien and Dwayne both insisted. So we put our hands on it, and we were sitting on two people's graves. It said ANDERSON, Mary and Gordon. We asked for Gordon first.
<br><br>
May: Is Gordon Anderson here with us?<br>
Ouija: Yesss<br>
<br>
Dwayne: Are you a good or bad spirit?<br>
Ouija: Yes<br>
<br>
May: You're good?<br>
Ouija: NO<br>
<br>
Darien: So you're bad?<br>
Ouija: Verri Bawd. (I think he was trying to spell very bad)<br>
<br>
May: How did you die?<br>
Ouija: Kille<br>
<br>
Dwayne: Killed?<br>
Ouija: Indeed.<br>
<br>
Darien: By who?<br>
Ouija: Goovernnmat<br>
<br>
May: The government?<br>
Ouija: Yes<br>
<br>
Dwayne sits out and Tanner comes in.<br>
<br>
Darien: How?<br>
Ouija: Smuthered<br>
<br>
May: Why?<br>
Ouija: I discoverd tat Canada governnmat was hiding secret life form.<br>
<br>
Tanner: You discovered that the Canadian Government was hiding an alien?<br>
Ouija: Yes and ws planonin invusin of amurica. (by now, if you haven't noticed, this Gordon is a crappy speller!)<br>
<br>
May: Canada was planning a secret invasion of the United States of America?<br>
Ouija: Yes.<br>
<br>
Darien: How did you find out about the alien and the invasion?<br>
Ouija: I went to the the mayor in Ottawa to complain about hunters on my farm.<br>
<br>
May: You're not from Saskatchewan?<br>
Ouija: No, the burnt and moved my bodie changed mine and my daughter Jane's name so nobody woruld fidn out.<br>
<br>
Tanner: How did you find out about the invasion?<br>
Ouija: I saw tat everybody was gone and went looking to talk to mayer and saw Canda government all around a dark grey body. It apeared to look human but  dead. It wa sa femmale. eyes were pitch wite. no other colr and the  bodi was starting to shrink.<br>
<br>
Darien: How did you find out about the invasion?<br>
Ouija: they snuck up behin me adn covered my mouth wit a cloth and said I guss you can knoe about the secret invasion of amrica. and I sffocated.<br>
<br>
May: What made you evil?<br>
Ouija: When I went hunting in woods I took teenage girls ad rape them after I killed them<br>
<br>
Tanner:  Goodbye<br>
Ouija: starts moving in circles to get out.<br>
<br>
I think it got out, because when we were running home I swear I could have heard someone running in the woods beside us, screaming come on Jane! And then there was a gun shot sound, and we all freaked out because we are only 13. After that, every night when we go by those bushes by Tanner's house we hear girls screaming and a man yelling.  We all feel bad, because now there have been many complaints of people being followed in those bushes or hearing girls screaming. And some people have claimed to have been raped by a hunter.  I will never play another Ouija board with the same people or in a graveyard.  My friends and I don't go around there anymore, and Tanner had to move out of the city to escape those noises. The guilt hurts lots. This is a true story, and I feel sick even when telling it.
