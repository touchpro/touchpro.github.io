On August 1, 2008 I received an e-mail from Rachael about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I am 13, and my dad's friends asked us around for a drink.  The ouija board came out, and we played (me, Leah, Ben, and Julie).
<br><br>
We contacted four different spirits: Three were good, one was evil.  Our main objective was to contact Leah's mum, who passed last April.  We had no success, but we contacted Hazel, Dameion, a spirit with no name, and Mrs. Green.  Here's how the conversation went.
<br><br>
Us: Hello, Hazel.  Ben misses you. (Hazel is Ben's mum)<br>
Hazel: Hello Ben<br>
<br>
Us: Do you have a message to pass on?<br>
Hazel: Frank (Frank is Ben's Dad...he's alive and married again)<br>
<br>
Us: What about Frank?<br>
Hazel: Julie, lung cancer<br>
<br>
Ben: Which Julie? My Julie!?<br>
Hazel: No, family Julie<br>
<br>
Us: Oh, is this Hazel?<br>
Hazel: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Ok, what is your Christian maiden name?<br>
Hazel: c-h-a-d-w-i-c-k (this was correct)<br>
<br>
Us: Oh!<br>
Hazel: 1 year Frank<br>
<br>
Ben: Dad has one year?<br>
Hazel: Dorothy (this is Ben's dad's new girlfriend)<br>
<br>
Us: Do you like Dorothy?<br>
Hazel: Hell, Dorothy<br>
<br>
Us: You don't like her?<br>
Hazel: No, Hell<br>
<br>
(We lost Hazel, and we began talking to someone named Mrs. Green.  Ben used to go to her caravan and stay there when he was a child)
<br><br>
Us:  How did you die, Mrs. Green?<br>
Board: Stroke<br>
<br>
Us: How old were you?<br>
Board: 70<br>
<br>
Us: How are you?<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
We contacted two more spirits.  I took my finger off and began to draw Mufasa from the Lion King.  While I was doing this, a mischevious spirit came and spelled out Mufasa and then spelled Rachael, Attention (I wasn't paying much attention).  The glass went funny so we said goodbye.
<br><br>
We then talked with a boy named Dameion, who was 19.  He told us that he was in a car accident and Lucifer burned him and he was in heaven.  He wouldn't let me leave at first, but eventually he said goodbye to me.
<br><br>
I would definitely do it again since our experience wasn't a bad one at all.  I have many other experiences, but I will e-mail them one day when I have time.
