On August 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jerrod about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So me and three other friends were at my friend Garrett's house. We decided to try to do the Ouija board. We lit two candles and started. I was the appointed question asker. This is how the conversation went:
<br><br>
Me (Jerrod): Are there any spirits here who wish to speak with us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Move to the sun if you are good, and to the moon if you are evil.<br>
Board: The planchette moved to the sun<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Dale<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name Dale?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, we heard a loud thump from right behind me. We quickly said goodbye and flipped over the board. We turned on the lights to see that there was one of those hard-shelled stuffed animals behind me. The thump was so loud that it must have been thrown against the wall. My friend's mom had said that it had been in her room a few minutes before we started, and she had been in the room the whole time. She didn't know what happened. We figured that the spirit had gotten mad. A few minutes later, my friend's landline rang once or twice and then stopped. This happened twice more after this. We looked at the caller id and saw that there was no numbers, just a bunch of weird lines.
<br><br>
In the morning, we decided to try the Ouija board again. So we lit two candles and tried again. Again, I was the appointed question asker. This is how the conversation went this time:
<br><br>
Me (Jerrod): Are there any spirits who wish to speak with us now?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Move to the sun if you are good, and to the moon if you are evil.<br>
Board: The planchette moved to the moon<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye (Then I moved the planchette to goodbye)<br>
<br>
Me: Are there any other spirits who wish to speak with us today?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Move to the sun if you are good, and to the moon if you are evil.<br>
Board: The planchette moved to the sun<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Dave<br>
<br>
Me: How are you doing?<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Me: Are you the same spirit that we spoke with last night?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Were you angry with us because we had gotten your name wrong?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Oh. Sorry. How old are you?<br>
Board: 38<br>
<br>
Me: Is there anyone with you?<br>
Board: 1<br>
<br>
Me: One person?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is it your wife?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Is it your child?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: A sibling of yours?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Can you spell out who is with you?<br>
Board: Rab<br>
<br>
Me: Are those someone's initials?<br>
Board: (No response)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you there?<br>
Board: (No response)<br>
<br>
Me: Ok then, bye Dave.<br>
<br>
Towards the end, the board was going slow, so we got a little sidetracked with a different conversation, and probably lost connection with Dave. A few minutes later, we checked the caller id history again, and the weird lines were gone. There wasn't even a trace that we had gotten a call, kind of like we had called back the number...
