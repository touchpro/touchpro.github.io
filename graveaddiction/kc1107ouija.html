On November 1, 2007 I received an e-mail from KC about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
On Halloween 2007, myself, my friend Nicole, our friend Kim, and her boyfriend Mike decided for Halloween we were going to go to a few graveyards and use our Ouija board.
<br><br>
Well, the first graveyard we went to had no specific spirit we were trying to contact. So we drove into the graveyard to the back so we couldn't be seen by the road. We went by a tree and took out our Ouija board and 12 candles. When we started, the temperature was a little chilly, but still ok.
<br><br>
We asked if there were any spirits there, but there was no answer. We asked again and still no answer, so I got frustrated and was like &quot;this is bogus...what a crock&quot;, but then we tried one more time. We finally got a response.
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits here?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you a good spirit or a bad spirit?<br>
Spirit: went to good in goodbye.<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Spirit: U.........R......2....L....<br>
<br>
Us: Oh my gosh, I think it wants us to leave.<br>
Spirit: goes to 1, then starts counting up...1..2...3...4...<br>
<br>
We started freaking out and went straight to goodbye, blew the candles out, grabbed the board, and ran back into the car and drove off.
<br><br>
After that we went to another graveyard where Nicole's uncle is buried. We went to his gravesite and put the Ouija board on his grave and put eight candles around the board. The temperature again was chilly, but not that bad. We tried to ask for Nicole's uncle by name.
<br><br>
Us: Is Daniel Ehrlich here?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you ok?<br>
Spirit: H...8<br>
<br>
We were trying to figure out why he would put hate...and Nicole got upset. So we took a break and tried again.
<br><br>
Us: Is Danny still here?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Nicole: Do you know who I am?<br>
Danny: No (Danny died before Nicole was born, so we figured he wouldn't know who she was)<br>
<br>
Nicole: I'm your niece. Do you understand?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Nicole: I'm your brother Fred's daughter. Do you understand?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Nicole: Are you glad I am here?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you in a good place?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Us: Are you in heaven?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Us: Are you in hell?<br>
Danny: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Was your suicide an accident?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Us: Did you do it on purpose?<br>
Danny: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Are you sorry for doing it?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
At this point Nicole starts to cry because everyone in the family thinks it was an accident. We aren't sure if it really was Danny or not, so nicole asked him a question that he would know and none of us did.
<br><br>
Nicole: What does my dad's middle name start with?<br>
Danny: K (that is Danny's initial)<br>
<br>
Nicole: What does your brother's middle name start with?<br>
Danny: (goes straight and fast) C. (Nicole's dad's middle name is Charles. None of us knew that so we figured it really was him)<br>
<br>
Us: Why did you kill yourself, Danny?<br>
Danny: G..Y..<br>
<br>
Us: Are those initials?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Us:  Can you help clarify?<br>
Danny: G..Y...W..X..Z<br>
<br>
Us: Confused...can you spell it out?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Nicole: Is there anything you want to let me know?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Nicole: What do you want me to know?<br>
Danny: R..E..M..E..M..B..E..Z<br>
<br>
Nicole: Do you want me to remember you?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Nicole: I will always remember you.<br>
Danny: Y<br>
<br>
Nicole: Because you are my uncle.<br>
Danny: K<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anything else you want to let us all know?<br>
Danny: G...W<br>
<br>
Us: Are those initials?<br>
Danny: No<br>
<br>
Us: Does it mean God's will?<br>
Danny: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do you want Nicole to follow God's will so she doesn't go to hell?<br>
Danny: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Danny, is there anything else?<br>
Danny: Bye<br>
<br>
So we said thank you and left. We gave Nicole a few minutes at the gravesite.
<br><br>
We couldn't for the life of us figure out what GYWXZ meant...then Nicole remembered that her family said that his medications were part of the reason he killed himself.  She is going to ask her grandma what kind of meds he was on and see if any of them match the letters he said.
<br><br>
That was one of the most intense conversations we had that night.  We are going to maybe go back to Danny's grave to talk to him again tonight, to maybe ask a few more questions that Nicole would like answered.
