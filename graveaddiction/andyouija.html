On December 19, 2004 I received an e-mail from Andy about his creepy experience with a ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I live in Columbus, Ohio and one Christmas year a family member brought me a Ouija board.  Me and my brother and my sister and her boyfriend sat at the table one night for 2 1/2 hours playing this very seriously.  What happened was when we started it, we asked &quot;if anyone was there&quot; and a answer came upon, and it was this teenage girl whose name was Alicia who lived in downtown Columbus.  She was murdered in an alley. We kept getting infomation and writing every single thing and she was telling us who did it and why she thinks it happened. We kept asking her where she was and she couldn't tell at first.  But then she remembered a banner that was on a building across the street: Jazz Band Bone. So while we were still playing this my dad was on the internet and got on google.com and searched the girl's name.  He found a murder history of this person in Columbus, Ohio and basically everything she told us was on the website and had the person's name. After we found that information we stopped playing the game and never touched it again, but I look forward to getting it back out again and doing it with my high school friends.&quot;
