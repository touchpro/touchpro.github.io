On March 26, 2007 I received an e-mail from an anonymous website visitor about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
In December of 2006, Christmas eve, My sister and I got an ouija board.
<br><br>
We asked it a question.
<br><br>
My question was &quot;Will I get accepted into the Career Academy for Dental?&quot;
<br><br>
The answer was &quot;Yes.&quot;
<br><br>
In February of 2007 [this year] I got accepted and I'll be starting at the career academy for dental the beginning of my junior year.
<br><br>
Then the next day, on Christmas.
<br><br>
We asked it if our grandma was there.  It said yes. Then we asked if she was a good spirit or a bad one.  It said good.
<br><br>
We asked if she was happy.<br>
She said no.
<br><br>
We asked why.<br>
She said she was mad.<br>
<br>
We asked at who or what.<br>
She said Harper [my ex-boyfriend's last name]<br>
<br>
I asked it what he did.<br>
She said taste you.<br>
<br>
I asked &quot;What's taste you mean?&quot;<br>
She said sex<br>
<br>
I asked if she was mad that Josh and I had sex.<br>
She said yes.<br>
<br>
I asked &quot;If I stop will you be happy?&quot;<br>
She said yes.<br>
<br>
I asked if she was in heaven.<br>
She said she was in hell.<br>
<br>
That freaked me and my sister out!<br>
<br>
Then, just a couple of days ago, my sister asked who her next boyfriend would be and it said Cam [her current ex-boyfriend].
<br><br>
She asked for how long, and it said 5...not days, weeks, months, or years.  Just 5.
<br><br>
Five days later, after my sister and Cam got together, he broke up with her...
<br><br>
I believe in the ouija board, and I think it's great!
