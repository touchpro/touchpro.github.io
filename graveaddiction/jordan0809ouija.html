On August 13, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jordan M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend called me over to his house, and we used a homemade ouija board.  We just asked a few questions and kinda messed around with it. Me, my friend, and my other friend went back home and made one of our own.  We asked around and had some fun with it. The next day we did it again.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone here with us today that would like to speak with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell me your name?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Please spell it for me.<br>
Board: Satan<br>
<br>
Me: I don't believe you, tell me the number of the beast.<br>
Board: 6-1-6<br>
<br>
We freaked and ran outside.  I went to the same friend's house we were at the previous night, and they said no way - bring it over here we'll try again.  I ran and got it and brought it over.  I set it down, and we got the same thing.
<br><br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: Satan<br>
<br>
Me: Tell me the number of the beast.<br>
Board: 6-1-6<br>
<br>
Me: What is my phone number?<br>
Board: X-XXX-XXX-XXXX<br>
<br>
(that is my real number - call it a guy named Jordan will answer)
<br><br>
Me: Why are you here?<br>
Board: Kill<br>
<br>
Me: Kill who?<br>
Board: nmy<br>
<br>
Me: Enemy?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who is your enemy?<br>
Board: JM<br>
<br>
Me: What did I do to make me your enemy?<br>
Board: the planchette went back and fourth between yes and no<br>
<br>
Me: You dont know?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: So you just hate me for no reason?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Leave here at once - I'm finished talking to you. Goodbye.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
I then went back to my house and did it again.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you still there?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
(I was trying to get it to say Lucifer)<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: satan<br>
<br>
Me: No, what is your real name?<br>
Board: satan<br>
<br>
Me: NO! What is your real name?<br>
Board: Satan<br>
<br>
Me: Do you worship god then!?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: Say it - say you worship god.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: So you do worship him?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Planchette went to the number 7.<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: satan<br>
<br>
Me: Leave me now! Goodbye.<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
My friend tried it by himself, and he said it didn't respond after that.  So I felt pretty good about myself :) I don't know what's going to happen though.
