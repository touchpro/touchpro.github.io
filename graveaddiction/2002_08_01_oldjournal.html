Today was a fun day, but it really wore me out!<br /><br />I went to the <a href="http://www.hockinghillsfleamarket.com">Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market</a> with my parents this morning.  I did find a few things: a hyacinth scented candle (very strong scent), a miniature hen on nest dish for my sister, and two soreno chip/dessert bowls...for only ten cents each!  It seemed really hot outside, there was no wind.  <br /><br />After resting at home for a little bit, my mom and I decided to go to Jo-Ann to look at picture frames for some stuff mom wants to display.  We got some ideas on what type of frames we might want, but didn't purchase any.  We did find Halloween decorations though!!  I really do love decorating for Halloween.  I found a really awesome candle holder.  It's ceramic and it looks like a crawling hand.  It has these gross looking finger nails, and the nails and knuckes glow in the dark!  Only one more month until I can decorate, I can't wait!<br /><br />We also went to New Uses, and I found a few pieces of glassware and coppercraft. I'll have to wash it all up and figure out where I want to put it.<br /><br />Not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow.  I should clean, but I'm sure I can find an excuse to wait another day.  I definitely know that I need to water my plants tomorrow, unless it rains...but I won't hold my breath, it never rains around here anymore :(  It's bound to rain soon though.  I need to learn some rain spells or dances ;)<br><br>

What a <b>BORING</b> day!!!!  A lot of my coworkers took the day off to make the long weekend even longer.  In fact, there are only 2 people, including myself, in the office today from my team.  I think there's only about 10 of us from my division in.  So it's extremely quiet, which makes a slow day even more like torture.  It really hasn't been <i>that </i> bad.  I've had a fun time talking with the people that are here.  But I'll still be happy when 3:30 arrives : )<br /><br />I don't have much planned for the weekend.  The only definite thing I have planned is going to the <a href="http://www.hockinghillsfleamarket.com/">Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market</a>.  It's right on State Route 33, between Lancaster and Logan (it's closer to Logan than Lancaster).  I love flea markets, and that one is a very nice one.  Lots of vendors with high quality items, it's not just junk like some flea markets.  But it's good to go to the ones with junk too, because sometimes you can stumble upon some nice stuff while looking through the junk. <br /><br />My eyes really itch today.  I just started using a new pair of my 2-week disposable contacts a few days ago.  If they still bother me tomorrow maybe I'll throw them away and put in a new pair.<br /><br />I may go down to my parent's tonight for dinner.  Mom has a coupon for Mauger's that needs to be used.  A fried combination fish platter sounds good right now.  Of course, a broiled seafood combination platter would be good too.  But I really like the fried fish combination...it's a good way to try a bunch of different types of fish.  They just thow on a piece of whatever they have in stock (they only cook fresh seafood).  The seafood combinations are good though....now I'm starting to feel hungry!  I didn't go and get anything for lunch today because I wasn't feeling hungry, now I regret doing that!<br><br>

Today we had a team lunch, we all went to Iacono's on Sawmill.  I had never been there before...well, several of us hadn't been there but the teammates who had really recommended it.  It was a good recommendation too!  We all had the pizza buffet, their pizza is really good.  Other than that, it was just a typical day at work.<br /><br />When I got home tonight I had a package in the mail from Gerry, Prince Pierre's owner.  I had no idea what it could be.  I opened it, and there was a stack of gray paper.  I flipped the first page over and there was nothing on it.  I was confused for about a second...then I noticed the white sheet of paper in the middle of the gray pages.  It was a thank you from Captain frog for my outstanding service to Prince Pierre! :)<br /><br />Really, it's been a pretty boring night...I've just been surfing the internet.  <br /><br />Tomorrow's Friday, and it's a 3 day weekend!!!!!  I can't wait, this week has been a long one.<br><br>

Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha...did I write that I was going to try to go to bed early tonight in my last journal entry?!  It's not too late yet, but it won't be early, just normal time.  Oh well.<br /><br />OK, my right arm, wrist, and hand are really sore today.  I honestly think it has to do with my pruning project last night, when I butchered the bush on my patio.  I guess it's what I deserve.  My arms, well wrists, bother me anyway, I think I may have carpal tunnel.  It's exactly the same pain my mom has, and we know she has it.  She's convinced I do too.  I wear the wrist braces at night and sometimes during the day if they're really bothering me.  But I am not ready to have the surgery, I don't think it's that beneficial.  Usually my left arm/wrist hurts more than my right, but today my right arm is killing me so I wore the wrist brace all night.  They help, but they're a pain, because one never realizes just how much they bend their wrists to do things until they have to wear one of those!  I'm sure the pruning project is what caused this pain.  Also, the "heel" of my right hand (the little padded spot under your thumb at the bottom of your palm) is bruised and it's a big knot.  My sister could tell it was swollen tonight too.  Next time I'll have to think more before I react when seeing a spider outside, won't I?!<br /><br />Katy stopped by after class tonight to drop off this ad her coworker John gave to her to give to me.  It's a frog ad, <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/frogad1.jpg">click here</a> to see it (or view it as a PDF file rather than a JPG by <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/frogad1.pdf">clicking here</a> instead).  It is a pretty cool ad. <br /><br />Katy and I also went to dinner, Don Pablo's.  It was really good, I hadn't gone there for a few weeks!  I don't know what made me think about it, but on the way home in her car I was looking at the dashboard.  I asked Katy if she remembered the time she decided to dust it and used way too much furniture polish, causing the dashboard to become super oily and shiny.  It made me laugh to remember it, she didn't find it as amusing as me.  As a result, she tried to think of something stupid that I did, which isn't a difficult task!  She ended up talking about the time in high school I fell while feeding the outside dogs.  We had a few inches of snow on the ground, plus we had a coating of ice over the snow due to an ice storm.  The outside dogs live at the top of the hill behind my parent's house, and I had a terrible time making it up the hill without slipping on the ice.  I had to use the trees to hold onto to make sure I didn't fall.  I made it up the hill without falling.  I fed and watered the dogs, but on my way down I lost my footing by Tillie's dog house.  I fell hard and was knocked unconscious.  I woke up and my grandma, who lived next door, was leaning over me asking me if I was OK, and Katy was outside too, literally rolling on the ground laughing.  She said it looked so funny when I fell, my feet flew up in the air and the container carrying the dog food spilled everywhere.  She was laughing so hard she could barely breathe.  I must have been out for a little while if my grandma made it over to check on me...she walked really slow.  I told Katy it wasn't funny, I could have been seriously injured, but that made her laugh to think about too.  I guess that's how little sisters are supposed to be though!<br /><br />I got home and talked to my mom on the phone, typical work conversations.  Then I called Chrissie and talked to her for awhile. I also called Jennifer.  It was fun to talk to both of them, but I spent way too much time on the phone!  Once I start talking I go on and on, and they're the same way :)<br /><br />Anyway, now I should call it a night and get some sleep...no garbage trucks to wake me up tonight!!<br /><br><br>

The garbage truck came to dump my apartment complex's dumpsters around 2:30 this morning...and I thought it was bad when the garbage truck wakes me up at 4:30!!  I couldn't get back to a normal, restful sleep after it woke me up, I'm really bad when it comes to falling back to sleep.  Well, I guess I'm don't have the easiest time falling asleep anytime, I don't know why.  I'm typically not stressed, and I try not to go to bed until I feel tired.  Also, I don't use my bed for non-sleeping activities like reading, watching TV, etc.  I've <b>always</b> had a difficult time when it comes to sleep, so I must just have some sort of insomnia?   Sometimes I take Valerian root capsules, those really help.  Also, my mom got me some Alluna Sleep.  That stuff is awesome!  It's not addicting, and it's made from natural ingredients.  I know there's Valerian and Hops in it.  I can't remember the other herb, I think it's Kava-Kava or St. John's Wort.  Maybe I'll take some of that tonight and go to bed early.<br /><br />I park in the same spot everyday here at work.  However, when I pulled into the parking lot this morning I noticed that there was a big part of it roped off...and that included my parking spot!  So I had to park someplace else, it felt wierd.  It's amazing how easy it is to get into a routine and get so possessive about something like a parking spot.  But it's funny, even if I'm a little late the people in the blue and the white cars that park to to left of my truck (or right depending on where you're looking from) always leave that second spot in the row open for me.  It's pretty cool!<br><br>

Tonight I had a terrifying experience.  I was outside watering my plants.  There's this big bush by one of the fences on my patio, and it always seems to be in the way when I water my plants that are located beside it.  I have no choice but to run into it, and it's a really scratchy bush, like pine needles.  But normally it doesn't bother me too much.  However, tonight I noticed that there were a bunch of spider webs in it.  And next thing I know, there's this big, fat-bellied, disgusting, gigantic brown spider crawling on my arm.  I reacted quickly and knocked it off my arm, screaming.  I HATE spiders more than anything else, they have always terrified me...no matter how tiny they are.  There were lots of spiders in that bush, a bunch of eggs must have hatched or something.  Well, I decided I wouldn't let anything like that happen again.  So I went inside and put on jeans, socks, boots, a long sleeved shirt, and work gloves.  I also grabbed my pruning shears and a can of Spider Killer Plus.  I throughly sprayed the bush with Spider Killer Plus (which is the best stuff ever made), and then got right to pruning it.  I may have gotten a little carried away though.  The bush looks really awful now, I hope I didn't prune it back too far.  There was this one time years ago that my mom got fed up with these bushes in front of her porch and pruned them too much...within a few weeks they had died, and then they looked even worse.  I hope that doesn't happen to me.  Well, if it does I'll just have to borrow a saw from someone and cut the whole thing down.  We'll see what happens.<br /><br />The spider fiasco was the most "exciting" thing that happened tonight.  I went grocery shopping, which usually isn't one of my favorite things to do, but tonight it wasn't too bad...Kroger's wasn't crowded at all.  I didn't need to pick up too much, the main thing was just picking up bread so I can pack my lunches for the rest of the week.  I also remembered to pick up a gallon of that iced tea Stacie told me about a few weeks ago.  It is almost a little too sweet for me, but I do like it.  <br /><br />I went to the Dublin Post Office during my lunch break today...Prince Pierre is now on his way back to Connecticut.  On the way back I stopped by Best Buy since the Breaking Benjamin CD, <i>Saturate </i>, came out today.  I listened to it at my desk, and I must say that it is a very good CD.  And it only came to $7.39 with tax, not a bad deal at all!  Best Buy is one of my favorite places to buy CDs, they have really good prices.<br /><br />Well, since I feel like I have spiders crawling all over me (I always have that feeling after I see one on me), I should jump in the shower.  And then maybe I'll go to bed, I haven't gone to sleep at a decent time yet this week!  I think that sounds like a fantastic plan!!<br><br>

Mark stopped by this evening to get a few pictures with Prince Pierre before I mailed him (Pierre) back to Connecticut.  I took a picture of Mark with the Prince at the cookout on Saturday, however a big light spot showed up in it and sort of ruined the picture.  So when I talked with Mark at work today he said he'd like to stop by my place on his way home, if I didn't mind.  And of course I didn't, it's always fun to have company.  My apartment is really messy though, but it still looks better than it did 2 years ago when I had an extremely messy roommate.  I don't think I'll go into the roommate stories, it still makes me shudder to even think about them!<br /><br />Anyway, Mark stopped by around 5...and we talked until 7:40!  We talked about my friends that were at the cookout (mostly good things!!), and we also talked about the good old days when we worked in the same area at Nationwide.  Well, "good" probably isn't the best way to describe that area :)  While I can honestly say that I hated working in that area, I must say that I really enjoyed working with the people in that area, we had a good group.  It was just the work and all the politics that made it bad.  We had some fun times, and I have lots of good memories from working with those people...I don't think I'll ever have a team that is as fun as that one!   <br /><br />In addition to talking with Mark, he also showed me the insides of the Brown Beast.  Mark's cars amaze me...I mean, he has cords and stuff under the hood that are just tucked away in a corner, not connected to anything.  And there's always some sort of fluid leaking...it's amazing they even run!!  The Brown Beast's exterior is starting to look worse to me, the paint looks kinda flaky in some spots.  But it runs, and that is the most important thing!<br /><br />I am really starting to get excited about Mark's cookout!  I think that visiting Point Pleasant, West Virginia (the home of the Mothman) and seeing Mark's old car pasture will be quite entertaining.  Also, Mark told me that his mom collects antique glassware...I love looking at other people's collections.  I think it will be a great time, and 9/7 is right around the corner!!<br><br>

What an exhausting weekend!!<br /><br />The cookout on Saturday was a lot of fun, and I was quite suprised that everyone who said they were going to come actually came!  And there was one surprise guest...Justin walked around the side of the house by himself, so I asked where Serene (his fiance) was.  He said she was coming, and then Serene walked around the corner, but she wasn't alone...Tommy was with her!  I hadn't seen Tommy since we graduated, so it was nice to see him.  I don't know if my "brother" Oscar was glad he came though.  Tommy growled at Oscar throughout the night, and I think Oscar was terrified of him!  I have a few pictures from the cookout on the <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/cookout.html">Prince Pierre Cookout</a> page.  The picture of Mark with Prince Pierre didn't turn out too good, so he's coming over tonight so we can take a few pictures before I mail the prince back to Connecticut this evening.<br /><br />Yesterday wasn't too productive.  I slept in late (which was AWESOME!), and then I got some pictures developed.  I also made rice krispie treats and no bake cookies for my coworkers.  Other than that, it was an uneventful day.<br /><br />Today's been a good day.  I've been busy testing.  And I also talked with Ben about the cookout...I had to hear his reaction to Chrissie's "Battelle Explosion Lecture".  Ben made the mistake of asking Chrissie about the explosion at one of Battelle's testing labs in West Jefferson that injured a few people.  She then gave him a lecture about how there are explosions at Battelle everyday, and then out of the blue the media talks about this one, blah, blah, blah.  She did overreact a little, I found it amusing.  I've learned to never ask Chrissie anything that might offend her, like religion, her places of work, etc, because she always gets a tad bit dramatic.  I just wanted to make sure Ben knew that she was like that to everyone, so he didn't think she disliked him or anything.  <br><br>

Today was a really good day...well, technically that's an incorrect statement since I just looked at the clock and noticed that it's after midnight.  So anyway, Friday was a good day.  <br /><br />I should start at the beginning of the day, but I'm not going to.  Tonight I went down to my parent's place.  We went to dinner and went shopping for tomorrow's cookout.  When we got home we were all sitting out on the deck talking.  Then the dogs starting barking because they heard someone over at the park next door.  It was my parent's neighbor Jim.  He works for the county and does a lot of groundskeeping stuff at the park.  He was over there with Nancy, his wife, and they built a small fire and invited us over.  Since Katy was going out later she decided not to go, but my parents and I decided to walk over.  We talked for quite some time.  I hadn't sat around a fire for months, and it was awesome!  It was great to smell the woodsmoke, and tonight was even cooler because there was A LOT of lightning! It's so humid lately that a thunderstorm will pop up every once and a while.  So fire and lightning, how cool is that?!  All I could keep thinking of was the lyrics to "All Hallow's Eve" by Type O Negative - "Fall fires burning 'neath black twisted boughs".  Too bad the trees still have leaves...like I said yesterday, I can't wait until autumn and Halloween!  I'd probably have to say that Type O Negative is my favorite band, and "All Hallow's Eve" is probably my favorite song by them.  Another thing to look forward to is a Halloween cookout.  There's a possibilty that I may get to host a bonfire/hayride at the park on a free weekend in October.  Jim's not sure which weekends are available yet, but any day that there is nothing planned at the park I could have a cookout!  I have all sorts of Halloween recipes I'd love to try out.  A bonfire is fun, but a hayride makes it even better!!  I still smell like smoke from the fire, I love that smell!! <br><br>When I got home tonight I had a message from my friend Theresa.  She's having a terrible time right now, it involves her boyfriend (well, ex boyfriend) and a girl that used to be her friend.  Sounds like a mess, so my goal tomorrow night is to get her mind off of that stuff for a few hours.  A few other friends from high school are coming too, so we're planning to have a "glucose fight"....back in high school we used to throw marshmallows at each other every time we had a cookout at my place. We called them glucose fights since marshmallows are basically just sugar.  We haven't grown up much, so we're planning to have a glucose battle tomorrow.  I think it'll be fun!!  <br><br>Work went great too!  For awhile I was kinda bored with testing statements.  Not terribly bored, but I missed the "excitement" of non-statements projects.  Well, I can say that those feelings are gone, because the current statements project I'm working on has been really exciting!  Some people like downtime at work and don't mind being bored, but I would rather be busy and challenged, it makes the time go by faster!<br><br>Also, I think I'd like to start a scrapbook.  I'm not sure what pictures to start with.  I went to Cord Camera in Hilliard today with Sheri, Dianne, and Dave during our lunch.  I wasn't planning to do so until yesterday afternoon.  Sheri invited me to go with them, and it sounded interesting.  I have lots of pictures that I have just thrown into photo albums.  I'd really like to organize them a little better, and the journaling that also goes with scrapbooking also interests me.  I was overwhelmed by all of the scrapbook supplies and paper options.  I'm going to have to put a lot of thought into this before I tackle the scrapbook project.  I don't want to spend too much time on a scrapbook because I really don't want to "neglect" the website.  I think I like building a webpage better than I would like scrapbooking.  But I have tons of time to think about it!<br><br>

The beginning of this week (Monday and Tuesday) went by really slow here at work, but things have picked up and I can't believe it's already Thursday!!  Whenever it's time to start testing statements time always goes by fast.  <br /><br />My mom is having a cookout on Saturday.  The weather forecast is only calling for scattered thunderstorms now, maybe a 50% chance of rain North of I-70...I don't think mom has anything to worry about.  There will be quite a few people coming, between 15-20.  I'm sure it will be a fun time!!  <br /><br />I am really ready for autumn.  I think my favorite month is October, because the temperatures are just perfect.  Not too cold during the day, but chilly at night.  Autumn even smells good, I like the "dead leaves smell" when walking through the woods.  There are usually lots of bonfires in the fall, and that's one of the best scents there is!  And of course, October is great because I can pull all of my Halloween decorations out of the closet and carve pumpkins!!  Also, the second week of October is the <a href="http://www.fairfieldcountyfair.com/">Fairfield County Fair</a>....time for the combine demolition derby!!  Regular demolition derbies are fun, but it's really cool when big combines (farm equipment) slam into each other! <br /><br /><br><br>

The <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/prince.html">Prince Pierre de la Ponde pages</a> are finally out on the site!!  I still want to make a few changes the the picture captions, but I'll probably do that next week. <br /><br />I am SO tired this morning!  I got to bed late because of laundry issues.  I won't go into the boring details, but unlike other nights that I decide to do my laundry at 9:30 PM, the laundry room was VERY busy last night.  I decided to wash my comforter, so I had 3 loads instead of my normal 2.  And since the person that was using five of the six washers didn't come to pick up their clothes until about 45 minutes after they were finished washing, all 3 of my loads were thrown into the washers at different times.  Usually I don't mind the common apartment complex laundry room, but on nights like last night I wish I had washer/dryer hook-up in my apartment.<br /><br />Every day I bring a bottle of water to work.  I pack it with my lunch the night before.  The bottle of water I grabbed out of the fridge last night was all the way in the back.  Now I know things in the back of my fridge usually freeze, but I thought I checked last night to make sure the bottle I chose wasn't frozen....I guess I didn't though, because when I pulled it out of my lunch bag it was <b>completely</b> frozen!!  That's not bad though, at least it will stay cold all day!!  Actually, maybe it won't...it's so hot in here that it will probably melt by 10 AM!<br /><br />I really like the song "Polyamorous" by <a href="http://hollywoodrecords.go.com/breakingbenjamin/">Breaking Benjamin</a>.  I heard it on <a href="http://www.thebigwazu.com">107.1</a> about 2 weeks ago and instantly liked it.  However, I had no idea who it was.  I found 107.1's <a href="http://www.thebigwazu.com/sections/specials/plays.htm">playlist</a> on their <a href="http://www.thebigwazu.com">website</a>, and that was the only song on the list I didn't know.  I did a <a href="http://www.google.com">search</a> on Breaking Benjamin, found their site, and downloaded the mp3...and it WAS the song I liked!  Their CD comes out on August 27, I'll definitely have to buy it!<br /><br />I was able to rewrite my lost test plan yesterday, it's been reviewed, and I'm ready to start executing it!  That should keep me busy today...<br><br>

I finished the "Prince Pierre Visits Columbus" pages last night.   However, I didn't FTP them to the site yet.  I had a TERRIBLE headache and took Excederin PM and was having a difficult time keeping my eyes open to work on the site.  I'll most likely FTP them tonight.<br /><br />The computer I use as my home work computer got the "Blue Screen of Death" last night, and as a result I lost one of the test plans that I'm going to start executing this week.  So I'll be busy today trying to rewrite it!<br /><br><br>

OK, I did some research on the Fostoria American vs. Indiana Glass Co Whitehall pattern during lunch and found some good info:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.auctionbytes.com/pages/abu/y201/m05/abu0038/s06">The Cubic Triad, Or "Do I Really Have a Piece of Fostoria American?"</a><br /><br />So it looks like even though this pattern is not Fostoria it's still collectible.  I have seen lots of Whitehall labeled as American!!  After visiting a few other sites with pictures, I'd say the glasses I picked up Saturday are older, probably from the 1960's.  I love collecting antique glassware, it is so exciting!  Finding antiques at flea markets, thrift stores, consignment stores, and yard sales is the best - sure, you have to dig through some junk to find it, but when you get a $6.00 (or more) piece for $0.25 it's totally worth it!<br><br>

What a busy weekend!!<br /><br />Friday night I went down to my parent's house and had dinner with my dad.  We went to Mauger's in Lancaster, I think it's one of the best seafood restaurants around here.  And of course my "brothers" (the wiener dogs) were excited to see me.  I think the only reason they get so excited about me visiting is that they know I'll give them snausages!<br /><br />Saturday mom came up to my place around 12:30.  We took Katy's old clothes to Rag-o-Rama to sell back...mom had 5 boxes in the truck!  I don't think the majority of the clothes had been worn more than once, and some had never been worn at all.  They were really busy on Saturday, and they weren't buying many clothes...so we still had 5 boxes of stuff.  But for the very few items they did take, mom got almost $11.  Not bad for selling back 4-5 items!  I knew mom wanted to get rid of the clothes, so  told her I'd drive her up to Plato's Closet on Sawmill Road.  We decided to check to see how long the wait was before unloading the clothes...and it's a good thing we did!  There was a 2-3 hour wait!  So we decided to wait and do that another day, and we went to New Uses instead.  I didn't find too much, but I did find a box of 4 glasses I sort of collect.  About a month ago I bought this set of 6 orange (or dark amber) glasses for $2.50.  I didn't need any more glasses, but they were just so orange I couldn't pass them up.  Well, a few weeks later I saw the same glasses at the <a href="http://www.loganantiquemall.com">Logan Antique Mall </a> for $6.00 EACH!!!  Made me feel good about picking up the whole set for $2.50!  They also had the same pattern in a light green color.  A few weeks ago when I was looking around the <a href="http://www.heartofohioantiques.com/">Heart of Ohio Antique Mall</a> in Springfield I saw lots of these glasses, and a few of the labels said they were Fostoria.  I thought that seemed strange, because they didn't look like Fostoria...they resembled the Fostoria American pattern, but it wasn't quite the same.  The glasses I found at New Uses this past Saturday were the light green color in this design, and they were in the original box...for $2.00!  Now I know for sure that they are NOT Fostoria, but they are the Whitehall pattern made by the Indiana Glass Company.  I'm not sure when they were made, I'd guess the 60's or 70's.  I'll have to do some research...<br /><br />After New Uses we had lunch at the Sunflower Chinese restaurant.  Mom and I had never been there, but lots of people had told me that it was really good...and they were right!  We finished lunch, and we were off to the <a href="http://www.shortnorth.org">Short North</a>!  It was a really hot, humid day so we didn't walk around too much.  We just went to <a href="http://www.paulrobinett.com">Paul Robinett</a>, Great Things on High, and Curio-a-Gogo.  It was quite fun.  I really liked all of <a href="http://www.paulrobinett.com">Paul Robinett's</a> new candle scents, and I got a patchouli and a cedar candle.<br /><br />After the Short North mom left for home, and I went shopping!  The first thing I had to do was put gas in the truck.  Then I went to Petsmart to get crickets and bloodworms for the frogs.  And since it was close, I also stopped in Media Play to pick up a few CDs.  There's this one song on the radio right now that I really like, but I have no idea what it's called or who sings it.  I keep hoping to hear it on the Blitz, because they usually say who sings the new songs.  I also went to Kroger to pick up a few gallons of water and bandages for my foot.  I seem to have a great talent for injuring myself.   Last Sunday night I was outside watering my plants without shoes on.  I rarely wear shoes or socks around the house, which can be a bad thing sometimes.  Somehow I managed to step on this big piece of wood that had broken off my fence.  I really stepped on it hard, it makes me wince to think about it.  I sat down and tried to pull it out gently, but it wouldn't budge.  I had to close my eyes (because I couldn't watch!) and really pull on it hard to get the splinter out.  I thought my foot would start to bleed after I pulled it out, but it didn't.  That's when I noticed all of the little splinters in my foot.  I spent a long time trying to get them all out, and I eventually had to stop when my foot started bleeding too hard for me to see the remaining splinters.  My mom recommended buying some draw out salve to put on the wound to draw out the rest of the splinters.  I don't know how that stuff works, but it really does!  Anyway, that's why I needed the bandages.<br /><br />I didn't do too much yesterday other than cleaning.  Well, I did go to Trader Joe's for the first time.  Sheri, Brenda, and Heather all told me I needed to check it out.  They were right, it's awesome!  I bought a few things, one thing was a Pad Thai kit.  I made it for dinner last night and it was VERY good, I'll have to get some more of those!  It wasn't spicy enough, but I have this Thai Seasoning that I got from World Market that really spiced it up!<br /><br />I should probably get back to work now.  It's going to be a busy day!<br><br>

The work day is more than half way over!  I'm taking my lunch right now, I packed today.  It is really quiet in here right now, of course, there are only 2 people on my team (including me) in the office today!  Actually about 45 minutes ago things weren't so quiet.  We were all laughing at these e-mails being sent out in response to a training opportunity.  We get these mass e-mails at work to keep us informed of company news, class offerings, etc.  Well, occasionally people forget how to use their e-mail and they reply to all instead of replying to the person they need to.  So they end up sending out mail to hundreds (or thousands!) of NW employees.  And it's never just one person that does it...that one response to everyone seems to cause a ton of other people to do the same.  It's quite humorous, I find it amazing to think that people use this e-mail software everyday at work and can't figure out the reply to all function!  Today's e-mail fiasco was even funnier, because a few people decided to send stupid comments back, like "Do not eat at Red Lobster they are not family friendly".  So about 20+ e-mails later there were no more responses to all.  <br /><br />Tomorrow my mom and I are going to Rag-O-Rama to sell some of my sister's old, barely worn clothes.  Katy has more clothes than any other person I know, she's addicted to them!  I've never sold clothes to Rag-O-Rama, but I did find my $28 red, brand new Dr. Martens there.  And I think after we've done that we may walk through the Short North shops...I love doing that!  I've been meaning to get some more <a href="http://www.paulrobinett.com">Paul Robinett Aromatherapy Candles</a>, he now makes patchouli scented candles.  That's one of my absolute favorite scents.  He also has a new cedar scent that I bet is awesome.  The candles aren't the biggest, but they are very strongly scented, one candle overpowers all of the other ones I burn!  Plus they burn for a long time.  I'd also like to go to <a href="http://www.salemwest.com/">Salem West</a>, I haven't been there for quite some time. <br /><br />I just heard from my mom who is off on vacation.  She took some clothes to the Salvation Army, and like a good mom, she went through the Bric-a-Brac section of the Thrift Store for me to look for cheap Anchor Hocking glassware and Coppercraft.  She said she found some bud vases, 2 coppercraft plates, and a glass grape bottle.  I can't wait to see all of it!<br /><br />Now it's time to finish my lunch so I can get back to work so I can leave on time tonight!<br><br>

Tonight was another night spent updating the recipe pages on my site.  I wasn't planning to work on that, but I finally found a kitchen/cooking background that I liked so I decided to go ahead and finishing updating those pages.  I also found a different background for my frog pages.  It's a lighter gray that makes the blue links easier to read.  They weren't too difficult to read before, but this is much better.  Let's see...I also updated the links page.  I'll have to finish everything else on my list of "web things to do" this weekend.<br /><br />The week seemed to go by really slow, but now it's difficult to believe that tomorrow is already Friday...not that I'm complaining :)  Today went really fast.  I left Tuttle around 10:30 to attend meetings downtown for the rest of the day.  I had an 11:00-12:00 meeting and then a 1:00-2:30.  So that left me an hour for lunch, so I met my family and had lunch with them.  The 1:00 Training didn't last the entire time, I was home around 2:15!  I ended up working from home until about 3:30, which was pretty nice.<br /><br />Another coworker started in on the "you'll be such a great mom someday" talk today.  They are shocked when I tell them that I can't see myself as a mom.  Now it's not that I'm totally against being a mom, maybe someday I will have kids.  However, I just have a hard time picturing that right now.  And no, I do not dislike kids, I think they're great!  Well, I do have to say that I like them better once they can start to talk and communicate their thoughts and feelings.  Anyway, I'm only 23, I have plenty of time to decide!  Some people (mostly women) also think it's strange that I haven't always dreamed about having babies...is it really that strange that I haven't?  I don't think it is, I just have other dreams/goals that I would like to accomplish first.  The whole "I can't believe you don't want to have kids!!" conversation is one that is starting to annoy me a little (which I'm sure is obvious!).  It ranks up there with the "You seem too nice to listen to that evil, satanic, devil music" conversation!  But I won't get started on that one...<br /><br />I talked with my mom tonight...she's taking a vacation day tomorrow since she's going to the Toby Keith concert with my sister tomorrow night.  I think it's funny that my mom is going to another country concert with my sister...this is the same lady that had me go to see Rob Zombie with her, and the same person who quotes Disturbed lyrics when she's having a stressful day at work!  Picturing her at a country concert makes me laugh!!<br /><br />I got an invitation to my friend Justin's wedding.  He and Serene are getting married on October 12.  I am planning on going, and I think Chrissie, Jennifer, Jake, and Andy are too.  I was talking to Justin about it at the reunion...it sounds like it's going to be a big wedding!  And speaking of talking to him at the reunion, thinking about the PartyLite candle conversation we had with him at Steak and Shake after the reunion still makes me laugh....I have never talked with a guy that knows that much about PartyLite designs and scents!  Chrissie said she'll have to be sure to invite him to her next party :)<br /><br />I have discovered that I really like the iced tea in the cafeteria at work.  I hated the cafeteria tea downtown, but this stuff is really good.  Stacie was telling me that Kroger sells gallons of sweetened iced tea that is awesome.  I'll have to try and go there this weekend so I can try it, I'm always looking for good iced tea that I don't have to brew.  But that means going to the grocery store, and that's towards the bottom of the list of things I like to do.  I don't mind it if the store's not crowded, but it seems like Kroger is always crowded when I go.  And crowded grocery stores seem to make other people rude...you have kids pushing carts into yours, people blocking the aisles talking on their cell phones (because they can't walk and talk?), and the cashiers usually aren't the friendliest when it's crowded either.  I usually try to go just once a month and get all my shopping done at once!<br /><br />It's time for me to get offline for the night.  I still need to pack my lunch for tomorrow and feed the creatures that live in the aquariums located throughout my apartment.  Then I think I'll be ready to call it a night and go to sleep!<br><br>

I wasn't sure if I'd get a chance to post another entry tonight or not!  I have so many things that I'd like to change on my website.  Tonight's project was moving all of the family recipe webpages from my old geocities recipe site to this site.  I had to rename a few files (like the index.html file) and change a few links.  I forgot how many recipes my mom had in the cookbook until I had to update all of them!  Now they are all located at <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/recipeindex.html">http://www.hoppytogether.com/recipeindex.html</a>.  I also added a few pictures of my grandma that weren't on the geocities page.  I haven't removed any of the pages from geocities yet, I'll do that tomorrow and place a redirect page out there so people that visit the old site know where I've moved the recipes.  The hoppytogether.com site is much more reliable than geocities, and there are no annoying pop-up ads.  I have plenty of space on my server, so this change just made sense.<br /><br />My remaining web projects include: finding a new background for the hoppytogether pages, adding some new links to the frog links and favorite links pages, updating the "what's new" page, scanning the Prince Pierre de la Ponde pictures and creating a page to display them on, adding a new "poetry by mom" page, adding a wiener dog poem written by my mom to the "wiener dogs from hell" page...and I think that's about all.<br /><br />This week at work has seemed to last a really long time.  Probably because I was on vacation all of last week :)  It's nice to have the time off, but the more days you're out of the office the worse it is to come back!  Our current release moves into the test region I work in next week, so things are starting to get really busy.<br /><br />I talked with Chrissie on the phone tonight.  She just signed all of the papers and she's buying a condo.  She's extremely excited, that's good news for her.  She's been trying to find one for weeks now.  I guess she's going to take me to see it sometime soon, that should be fun.  We also talked about the five year high school reunion that we attended last week.  We both agreed...no one had really changed too much.  We had a good turn out, I think there were about 34 of us (including myself).  There were 71 or 72 of us in the class, so that's about half.  Everyone seemed to mingle a lot at first, but about half way through the night we were all back in our old groups of friends and the mingling was just about finished!  But that was fine with me, I would rather talk to the people I was friends with instead of the people I almost never talked to.  I must admit, I was not excited about going to it, and if I hadn't helped Chris plan it I probably wouldn't have gone.  But it would have looked bad if I helped him with the invitations and then didn't show up! :)  Anyway, as much as I dreaded going, I ended up having a fantastic time!!<br /><br />I am getting excited about my friend Mark's cookout...his parent's are having a cookout and hayride at their place in September.  Mark sent me an e-mail on Monday and asked if I'd like to go down there about 4 hours early so we could take a trip to nearby Point Pleasant, West Virginia and tour the areas that the Mothman was sighted at.  Mark told me about the Mothman long before the Mothman Prophecies movie was made (I still haven't seen the movie!).  I also read the Mothman Prophecies book that Mark's friend John was kind enough to lend me.  The whole Mothman thing is really interesting, and I'd really like to visit Point Pleasant.  He has all sorts of eerie stories about things that have happened to him and his friends in that area.  Mark says that it is one of the creepiest, scariest places around...guess I'll find out.  Also, Mark will take me back to his "Car Pasture"...the field at his parent's place where all of his old cars retire to!  <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com/oldblue.html">Old Blue</a> is back there now, I can't wait to see how awful it looks after being "out to pasture" for over a year!<br /><br />Well, I should probably check my e-mail one last time and then log off and get some sleep!!<br /><br><br>

I've FINALLY found an online journal tool that I like to use!  Blogger.com is by far the best I have come across.  I've been wanting to start a journal for a long time, and now I have.  I think it'll be fun to have a place online to keep track of my thoughts, things that have happened, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, I need to get back to work, I'll post more later!<br /><br /><br><br>
