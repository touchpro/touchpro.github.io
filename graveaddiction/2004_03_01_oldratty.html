		<div class="content">Mommy is a bitch.<br />Mommy's mommy is a bitch.<br />The whole family sucks.<br />Can you believe it?!  I found out what boarding the cat means, it means a week of being caged in a room with other cats and dogs, lesser beings all of them, and having to put up with their smells and noises.  No special attention given this kitty, no way, I am just one of the other "animals".  My only consolation is that those insufferable creatures known as the boys had to be boarded as well and their "sentence" was one whole day longer than mine.  At least mommy had enough sense to come and retrieve me from that hell hole and bring me home a whole day early!  So I spent a miserable week in hell while the whole family, including mommy's friend Mike, goes on vacation.  Oh yes, vacation, a pleasurable time for them, pure torture for me.<br /><br />Seems mommy's cousin Jason was getting married in Covington LA, which happens to be only 38 miles from New Orleans, City of the Dead, City of the Parties, City of the infamous drink the Hurricane.  So mommy and her mommy decided to make the event into a family vacation.  Oh sure go down there and have fun while I smell cat and dog shit and was not even given a decent bed (by my standards that is).  Guess everyone had safe flights down and back.  Seems the weather was in the high 70s to low 80s range and sunny.  Guess they saw all the French Quarter had to offer, went on a Swamp Tour, saw the Garden District, Cemetaries, plantations, and even visited an alligator farm.  Thank God they don't sell pet gators or mommy and Mike would have bought one because they are soooo cute....whatever!  Mommy's mommy said she cannot eat anymore seafood for a long time, first because what she had down there was so totally better than anything around here and second, that is just about all she ate down there and she is ready for different things.  Mommy's mommy and Beth really were bold and ordered alligator nuggets and ate them.  Tastes like chicken....oh really?  Anyway, they swear it does but is much tougher and mommy's mommy says she would probably never eat it again.  Guess they went to a crawfish boil, you know those things we call crawdads and kids play with in creeks?, well they boil up huge bags of them with potatoes, corn on the cob, whole heads of garlic, onion, bay leaves, and lots of cajun spices, dump the whole mess into a larger container (at the party it was a canoe) and let everyone stand around the canoe and eat the gross looking things or take a scoop, fill up a box top and go eat them at a table.  Talk about an animal dying in vain, most people only separate the tail from the body and eat that teeny little morsel of meat.  Takes a whole lot of the poor little lobster wannabees to fill up a person.  A big pot of jambalaya was served too and plenty of beer since that is really good with all that spicy food.  Mommy likes them but just doesn't care to work so hard for her food, same with her friend Mike.  Mommy's mommy and Beth the Brutal liked it and really got into it but they are the bolder ones in the family and more likely to try different things (back to ordering gator nuggets).  Mommy's daddy ate some and said it was okay but really seemed to enjoy the beer more.  Oh yeah, sometime in there they all attended a wedding.  Guess out of all the family that went Mommy's mommy was in command of the wildest group that didn't sit long in one place.  Mommy's mommy said she is so tired she is glad she took a few extra days off work, she needs it to recuperate.<br /><br />My ass, recuperate.  She has been on the phone setting up appointments for window people to come and give estimates and fence people to come and give estimates.  She is determined to get a fence up so when she is out gardening she doesn't have to watch the dumbass dogs too.  They think they are big normal dogs instead of the short legged, long bodied mutants that they are.  OH WAIT!  This is wonderful, seems mommy's daddy got a tee shirt with a long haired dachshund on the front of it, just like Oscar the Rotund.  Mommy's mommy says he can wear it around the house but not in public, he will look like a really old silly man.  Of course she bought tee shirts with voodoo all over them.  Thankfully she did not bring home voodoo dolls.  She said they were too expensive and she has one big one anyway plus she learned how to make gris gris bags which she can use.  I hope to hell she is kidding, she is getting strange as she gets older.  Not sure I trust her not to dabble a little with the darker arts...ooooeeeeeeooooooo (scary noise).  Anyway, back to recuperating, she doesn't do that well, she has been on the go since she got home.  <br /><br />Well, things to do but will check back. </div><br>

		<div class="content">Praise Be to the god of Pussies, pussies like me that is.  Woohoooo, talk about pissing your pants, well I would have tonight if I wore pants.  I have a fan who missed me while I was out.  One adoring fan and his name is...Dave.  If Dave were here he would have just had to have kicked some serious ass for me.  Can you believe I am back here blogging my little paws off and I hear the dreaded words "Go getum, go findum"  Look asshole aka Mommy's daddy, Mommy's mommy and I are busy blogging.  She is here to help if I need it since she is at my command (she just gave me the finger, I must be #1) but mommy's daddy is just downright annoying.  Him and those stupid mutant dogs of his.  Can you believe the three of them have invaded my space!  TRAITOR, mommy's mommy just gave one, the smellie one, Oscar the odiforous a big hug.  That is one stinking dog.  He is so mutated that he is very stocky and has really short stubby legs and a huge chest.  In weather like this that chest and those legs suck up moisture that collects under his front leg pits and the smell that emits from him is like a bubbling cauldron of swamp slime.  Woooweeeeeee, gag a maggot smells coming from his direction.  Mommy's mommy will probably get a damp rag, get him down, wash his pits and smear him with cortizone cream and fungal medicine.  Great, the dog has athlete's foot in his leg pits.  Totally gross!!  Max the Mangler is never without a toy in his mouth, must be some kind of sick fetish.  Sam is just psycho, scared to be picked up, scared to be put down, freaks if someone rattles a bag, freaks if mommy's mommy wants to condition her hair and walks around with a shower cap on her smeared up head...well, I guess that is pretty darned scary, but you get the point, Sam is a freaky little dog.  Personally some doggie prozac would do him a world of good.  My drug of choice is catnip, home grown and fresh off the plant, gives me a whole new outlook on life.  Come on Spring, let the catnip season begin!!!  Ratty needs a fresh fix.  Sure the dried, especially the home dried, 'nip is good but nothin' like the buzz I get from fresh 'nip.<br /><br />Anyway, back to my friend Dave, who by the way, speaks in rhymes.  He is sick of winter too.  Well, thankfully today there is no snow, just buckets of cold rain with some snow so everyone remembers that we pissed Mother Nature off so she is getting even.  Oh, and this morning there was fog.  Fog is totally creepy and the heavier the fog the creepier.  So many books and movies I have read and seen have really scary shit happen in the fog.  All sorts of strange creatures exist in the fog and none of them has anything good on their mind.  Most have sharp claws or fans or at least a claw hammer and some weird ideas of what they should do with weapon of choice.  Glad I am a cat and can see well in fog and darkness, otherwise I would be scared shitless.  <br /><br />Speaking of shitless, I no longer am.  I am back to my regular bathroom habits and since I am pooping well I was thoughtful enough to crap on the floor so mommy would have the pleasure of cleaning it up.  I just know she enjoys that so.  Excuse me a moment, need to lick my butt.              Baaaccccckkkkk, thrup, back now, little bit stuck to my lips and took me a moment.  Anyway, I am feeling so much better but I am not sure what boarding means.  Mommy has been telling me she is going on vacation and I will be boarded as well as the boys, oh my, something tells me I will not like "boarded".  Time will tell and you know I will share my thoughts on the matter.<br /><br />Mommy was quite pissy last night.  Seems mommy's mommy and daddy want replacement windows and some guy came into the house and well, I kinda thought he was going to stay all night.  He talked and showed mommy's mommy and daddy stuff and talked and talked and made phone calls.  Mommy's mommy and daddy seemed to be getting a little angry, they kept saying, we only want the estimate we are not signing anything tonight and we will get back with you and one time toward the end mommy's mommy said to mommy's daddy that her patience was just about done and if the guy didn't leave soon they would just have to put him out.  Wonder if that is anything like putting him down like they did with Cherokee, but I'll never know because mommy's mommy said no in a way that the guy just sighed and left, after 3 1/2 hours.  Mommy was pissy because she got home from class and just wanted to eat, shower, show me love and affection, cram in bed without disturbing me and go to sleep and that guy was interfering with her plan of action.  Thankfully mommy's mommy told her to go ahead and take a shower, he would be leaving soon.  I don't think he thought he would be leaving soon but mommy's mommy didn't seem to care about his opinion.  Something tells me this isn't over because I know they really want replacement windows.  All I know is that mommy's mommy and daddy said that will never happen again.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy really does lots of fun stuff at work.  She had a group interview at work Tuesday.  She said it was fun and she hopes she gets the job.  She should, she is a wonderful person and modest and would be an asset to any work group.  Okay, she threatened to beat me and let the asshole dogs get my food if I didn't say all that.  Still, I know she would like a different job.  She came home saying that she works with a worthless asshole that would argue the color of the sky with her for days.  She says he is a real pain in the ass and would not miss him at all.  She said she even used him as an example of a difficult coworker in her interview.  She even said some nastier things but I won't repeat those because she said she will go to hell for saying them and I certainly do not want to go to hell with her.  I have heard her say however, that she thinks she might go straight to heaven because she is sure she works in purgatory or the heat wouldn't be so high.  She even bought a thermometer and put in her cube because she got tired of people saying it was just hot flashes (no one has an all day hot flash) so she was going to prove to them it is hot.  Then again, anything in the house over 66 is hot to her.  Guess she is one HOT MAMA.  She said she is going to try to get some beads when she goes to Bourbon Street and Beth the Brutal and Mommy say they will be so embarrassed if she does.  Time will tell and I will share.  Mommy's daddy says he might as well take some extra money for bail just in case.  Not all of this makes sense to me but Mommy's mommy just gives them the middle finger (they are #1 just like me I guess) and a snotty look.<br /><br />Almost the weekend, gotta love those weekends.  Everyone will be in a better mood even if the weather is fucked up and you can't go outside without sinking in mud up to you knees.  Weekends are great, mommy sleeps in, Mommy's mommy and daddy go to breakfast and Beth the Brutal, Deliverer of Extra Pounces to me visits (so she can mooch a free meal  heheheheheeeeee).  <br /><br />Until later,  Ruler Ratty</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello adoring fans, if I have any left.  Bet you thought I had died.  Well, I haven't, it is just that I HATE WINTER.  Truly fuckin' hate this shit.  Cold, dreary, rainy, snowy, and BORING!  So boring in fact that it made me sick, really made me physically ill.  I mean, mommy has been busy with school and her friend Mike stopped working at the airport so when she wasn't in school she was with him, not doing the things she is supposed to do like clean up her room that is so bad it should be condemned and pay attention to me.  We used to do things like exercise on all the equipment in the basement or I would help her quilt but hell no, not anymore, she has to spend all her spare time with him.  That's ok, I gave him attitude because I can because I am the Ratter, Vicious and Cruel!  But anyway, mommy was busy with everything but me (let me tell you I have had extra dirty litter box because of neglect on her part many times this winter and that is very upsetting to me as well as mommy's mommy), mommy's mommy has been pissy because her work sucks, she works with assholes, Corporate America only cares about the bottom line, take  your pick but she has been pissy plus she was on a cleaning frenzy and she got pissier because no one was helping and mommy's daddy has the butt sniffing, genitalia licking, mutant dogs so he ignores me and those little mutants are bored and think I exist to be chased by them, the dumbasses.  Beth the Brutal is okay but big whoop,I only see her once a week for a couple hours when she comes down to mooch a meal (she hates it when I say that so I said it because I am back to being the real me!)  Basically I have been ignored the past few months.  Mommy's mommy started to notice that I laid around like dead cat, my coat looked like dying cat coat and I just wasn't eating and being my nasty/demanding self.  When I stopped eating she mentioned it to everyone very forcefully that the cat is sick and someone better do something.  Then I stopped drinking and lets face it, nothing in means nothing out.  So mommy had to take time off work to take me to the vet.  I really dislike going to the vet.  Even sick it is hard to get me into the carrier.  Mommy even took the larger dog carrier thinking this would make it easier, no way, I can be one determined cat and I can brace my legs again almost any part of a carrier.  Also, at the vet it took two people to pry me out and then two to unpry me from the examining table.  Let me tell you, they did some shitty things to me.  Dug crap out of my ear, stuck a thermometer up my butt, listened to my innards, felt me all over the perverts then took me in the back, stuck a needle in my leg and took blood.  After all that I got a shot and some crap to take home to take.  The vet said it could just be a virus or maybe depression.  No shit Sherlock, duh, like mommy's mommy had already said that.  Anyway, here it is a couple weeks later and I am feeling better.  My coat looks better because mommy brushes me, on nice days she makes sure I get a trip outside and her and her mommy squirted that liquid crap down my throat.  So to get even I have been shitting all over the basement just because I can even though mommy has been doing a much better job of keeping the crapper cleaned for me.  Want to laugh, they are just all happy I am better.  Except for the mutant asslickers, they wish I had died because they would like all mommy's attention too.  Hell, one of them probably gave me the flu or something.<br /><br />Anyway, I am back and will try to write more often.  The family has been talking about a vacation and boarding us.  I am sure that will be something I had since the word vet has been associated with the boarding.  But as I find out more about the vacation I will be sure to let you know.  What is a New Orleans anyway?<br /><br />Mommy is staying the Beth the Brutal tonight so I felt okay about monopolizing her pc.  Mommy is stressed, her supervisor at work is a zombie with a pissy attitude.  Mommy keeps saying WalMart looks better everyday.  Well, as long as mommy can pay for my food and POUNCE I don't care where she works.  Oh yeah, mommy got a new car too so she needs to make enough to pay for that.  But I love mommy and I don't want her stressed and sick.  Mommy's mommy is a little bizarre and she keeps saying she is going to buy voodoo supplies in New Orleans.  Again, not sure what that means but Beth the Brutal laughs and says that mommy's mommy will probably do it and use them too.  Doesn't bode well for the people that mommy's mommy thinks are assholes (and that is quite a few people).  Mommy's mommy can be so bad sometimes, she says that one person at work is the Creeper demon thing (from Jeepers Creepers the movie) because she just knows that if someone would run over that person her wing would pop out and start flopping around.  She also works with a Hairy Faced Witch that she doesn't trust for one minute, she works with an idiot that beats a dead horse longer and better than anyone else (what the hell?), and assorted dumbasses and morons that make her wonder how they get through life on a daily basis since they have no common sense.  Mommy's mommy is my kind of lady, wicked and vile.<br />Mommy's mommy is not always the "best" mommy.  If mommy or Beth the Brutal give her any grief she is quick to tell them exactly what is on her mind and remember, mommy's mommy tends to have a mouth that would make a drunken sailor proud (no, just quoting an old saying, not trying to offend anyone, I believe in diversity).  Tonight Beth the Brutal said mommy's mommy was stupid for even asking mommy to go with her to the home and garden show tomorrow night.  Mommy's mommy called Beth the Brutal a bitch.  Of course, mommy's mommy is right, the Brutal is a bitch (even though she sometimes forgets that and gives me Pounces for which I am grateful) and I am proud of mommy's mommy for her honesty.  <br />Yeah, I am back and will try to blog more frequently.  Winter just sucks.  At least the crocus are blooming...well for a little while since the tree pissers walk all over them and break them off.  Those dumbass dogs don't have a brain in their heads.  But they do have burrs in their coats since they have been trekking through the woods.  <br />Gotta go for now.  Tis a dark and windy night and can you believe there might be a dusting of snow!  At least there has been a touch of spring so won't be long and I can sit in the windowsills late into the night watching nighttime activity rather than huddle under the blankets on mommy's bed.<br />Until later, I remain the recovered Ratty the Ruler!<br /></div><br>
