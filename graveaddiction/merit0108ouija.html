On January 5, 2008 I received an e-mail from Merit Hicks about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Merit Hicks, and I am here to tell you about my Ouija Board experience.  Me, my sister, and her boyfriend were all at his house one night.  We had bunches of candles lit and some incense.  Well, we we have talked to like three different spirits that night. One named Sally, one named Fred, and another named Cadience.  Cadience was the coolest one.  I have never really had a bad experience, but this is a cool story.  So I got to tell ya.
<br><br>
OK, this all took place a couple of days after Christmas.  Because that is when I got the board.  So I don't know the exact date.  But anyway, we started talking to spirits and everything.  Then all of a sudden the board started counting down from 9- to 0.  And when it got to 0, my sister's boyfriend's cell phone starting ringing!   It was his friend, Michael.
<br><br>
So we all thought that was pretty cool.  But we wanted to take a break.  We were all in shock...First time I ever used a Ouija Board and that happens LOL.  And right before all this took place, my sister's boyfriend said he didn't know if he believed in it or not.  So maybe they did that for proof.
<br><br>
Then we started doing it again about an hour or half later.  I asked it to do something cool...to blow out a candle.
<br>
It said I will later.
<br>
So we waited for a little while, then it started counting down again from 9 to 0.
<br>
So we were looking around and saw one of the candles was blown out...PRETTY COOL lol.
<br><br>
So that is my experience with the Ouija Board.  It was a fun one, and I hope to keep it that way.
