On May 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from an Allison P. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Our school has a fenced off portion of forest behind it that we call the Envoirnmental Learning Center, or the ELC. There is a small observation dock that leads out into the middle of a marsh - it only has one exit, and the dock isn't very big. Four friends and I decided to hop the fence late at night with a homemade Ouija board and lots of candles and have somewhat of a seance/Ouija board &quot;experience.&quot; None of us had ever had a legitimate experience with a Ouija board, so we sort of made it up as we went along. The conversation quickly took an unexpected turn:
<br><br>
Us: Spirits, if there be any, we wish to speak with you. Are there any spirits here who are willing to talk to us? We only want good spirits, please.<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Have you been here long?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Are you buried in this marsh?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: Are you a girl or a boy?<br>
Board: G. (We took this to mean girl)<br>
<br>
Us: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 15.<br>
<br>
Then, without us asking anything:<br>
Board: Deserted.<br>
<br>
Us: Deserted? By who?<br>
Board: Father.<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anything we can do to help you?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: What?<br>
Board: (very slowly and deliberately) RUN.<br>
<br>
We apologized, put the planchette on &quot;Farewell,&quot; extinguished our candles, ran through the woods, and hopped that fence faster than I have ever seen us move. It was so scary. I had been a bit skeptical at first, but after this, I fully believed. It was strange that she always answered in one-word phrases, but I think it made it more believable. She obviously was concerned for our safety, and didn't want us talking to her anymore, but because we made it clear that we didn't want to speak to evil spirits, I do not believe she was evil. We will probably never go back to the ELC to try to communicate with her, but I sort of wish we could have relieved some of her suffering. It's surreal to speak with the dead. I hope to have more experiences with our Ouija board in the future. Thank you!
