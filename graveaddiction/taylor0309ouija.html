On March 26, 2009 I received an e-mail from Taylor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Taylor, and I am 17. I got my first Ouija board about 2 years ago, off eBay. It's one of the really old ones.
<br><br>
Anyway, I have a story about it.
<br><br>
One night, me and a group of friends (about 7 people) went out to Strawberry Chapel, formerly known as Childsbury Plantation. It is a haunted church, crypt, and graveyard in Monks Corner, SC. The story behind it is very long, but it has to do with slaves kidnapping the plantation owner's daughter, Elizabeth Childsbury, and locking her inside the church. We go there quite often, and something different happens everytime we go. We've seen figures, and heard many voices there. It's one of the most overwhelming feelings, but I never get scared. This night, however, we went inside the church through a broken window. Then I got this terrified feeling. We heard what sounded like whispering, and then a rat ran by. We got freaked out so we went outside.
<br><br>
Anyway, a little while after that, we decided to use the Ouija board to try and contact spirits. We started asking questions, but we were getting no responses, at first. Finally we got something when we asked about Elizabeth. She said she was there, but we thought it was one of my friends moving their hands. So we asked her to give us a sign, and the board spelled out R-A-T. I freaked out. That was my first experience with it, and I will never forget.
