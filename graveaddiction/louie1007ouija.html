On October 24, 2007 I received an e-mail from Lou about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
On the October 22, 2007, I picked one of those sites from the web that has an Ouija board. Not my first time, but past intents did not do very well. Those other times, one character by the name of Walter came through. He was 24 and had been assasinated. So I set him straight and on he went. Haven't heard from him yet.
<br><br>
However, this time, it was early in the evening. I opened the Ouija web page and did as told. This was a Spanish version of the web page. It went like this. You'll probably be surprised, as I was, as to who came through at first.
<br><br>
Lou (me): Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Spelled something to the effect that 'no' there wasn't.<br>
<br>
Me: What can I help you with?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: 'They' used to call me CHARLES MANSON<br>
<br>
Me: Can I help you to the Light at the Bridge?<br>
Board: Maybe.<br>
<br>
I then went and did my ritual to have this soul be led and indicated to the place where it should be.
<br><br>
I said Goodbye and that was that. I then closed the website and went about my business.
<br><br>
However, later that night, about midnight, I decided to take another look into that web page Ouija board again. So I opened the web page again.
<br><br>
Me: Is anybody there?<br>
Board: Something like 'perhaps'.<br>
<br>
Me: What are you called?<br>
Board: They call me Luisa<br>
<br>
So I went on inquiring if she was my late aunt.<br>
Board: They know it.<br>
<br>
When it started answering everything with 'they this, they that', I simply said Goodbye and moved on to my next spirit.
<br><br>
Opened the board again.<br>
<br>
Me: Is anybody there?<br>
Board: I haven`t seen.<br>
<br>
Me: You are blind?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: (in English) What is your name? (remember, all these conversations are in Spanish)<br>
Board: (in Spanish) I don't understand.<br>
<br>
Me: (then in Spanish) What is you name?<br>
Board: Veronica<br>
<br>
Me: What brings you here Veronica?<br>
Board: (it spelled something to the effect that it wanted me or wanted to get me)<br>
<br>
I then went instructing it to get ready for the Light at the Bridge.<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
So I proceeded to send her on her way and closed the session.<br>
<br>
Is this legit? Is this website stuff real? Has anybody else had any success with it?
<br><br>
Here is the website if anybody wants to try it:    <a href="http://www.pasarmiedo.com/ouija.php#" target="_blank">http://www.pasarmiedo.com/ouija.php#</a>
