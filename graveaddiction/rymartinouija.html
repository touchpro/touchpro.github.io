On August 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Ryan Martin about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My two friends and I were playing with the ouija board yesterday. We were talking to some spirits and we were getting bored, so we asked them to show us that they were there. When we were in the basement the lights flickered. We were excited about this experience. We asked who Jason's guardian was, and the board spelled out &quot;ophp&quot;.  We asked if that was his name, and it said &quot;yes&quot;.  We also asked him to show us that he was there, and he said that he would.  Then I was looking on the wall where there was some light, and I saw a shadow of a head walk by. I told my two friends to look, and then Joey saw it as well.
<br><br>
We were excited again, so we asked if we could see him in the TV screen. It said &quot;yes&quot;. Then in the screen we saw  a circular, yellow light appear for two seconds. This spooked us, so we said goodbye and ran upstairs with the board. We decided to play again in my room, and we put a folded chair on my bed to see if the spirit could push it off...and it did. The chair fell off the bed!  Now when I go to sleep every night I see a dark shadow on my ceiling come closer and closer to me.  I don't know how to get rid of it - any tips? I have the chair experience on tape, we filmed it. The ouija board is not to be fooled around with.
