On August 6, 2009 I received an e-mail from Sarah about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Sarah, and I am 21 years old. I purchased my first board from eBay in June. It's from 1972 with light wear...I got it surprisingly cheap considering the condition (including s/h about $20). I was super excited for any and all reasons one could open themselves up to. While waiting for it to arrive, I did my research on proper usage because I obviously wanted to be as safe as possible.
<br><br>
*At this point I should mention that even though this would be my first experience ever, (I've never even seen one in person or attempted to make my own) I am a firm believer of the supernatural. I have an open mind. I do not consider myself to be a strong follower of any faith.*
<br><br>
Well. The board arrives and I want to use it right away. So far, it's just been me and my boyfriend that I live with - let's call him D. D doesn't believe in any power or energy a ouija board may have, and argued it's all about the science of electromagnetic fields. I eventually convinced him to do it with me. It was around 7 P.M. Said prayers, had water and flowers and began.
<br><br>
Me: Is there a kind spirit here who wishes to speak to us?<br>
Board: (several minutes of no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: D., you're not being serious enough, please... (he was very distractible and I saw him roll his eyes)<br>
D.: Honey I don't even wanna do this.<br>
Board: G   ....  T (the movement was very slow and heavy)<br>
<br>
Me: Oh! G.T. Are those your initials?<br>
Board: G... G.... T... (starts moving away from letters and off board over the course of maybe 15 minutes)<br>
<br>
D.: See. Makes no sense. I'm done. Punk ass ghosts. (Removes fingers from planchette)<br>
Me: *sigh* Alright. I did not mean to intrude. Thank you. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
A few hours later I wanted to try again. D. didn't want to, so it was just me. Same rituals...After 15 minutes or so I felt like it was moving to G T again. I was getting tired and the movement was even weaker so I said goodbye hoping maybe he would try again tomorrow.
<br><br>
Something I didn't realize at the time was that &quot;G T&quot; may have been possibly trying to spell &quot;get,&quot; as in &quot;get off&quot; or &quot;get away.&quot; I was not scared, and felt I was in no danger. After all, nothing &quot;spooky&quot; happened and we both slept well.
<br><br>
D. slept with no shirt on that night. The next morning I couldn't help but notice a 3 inch long sort of deep scratch going horizontal ever so neatly done on his stomach. We searched for any possible thing that could have cut him, but nothing turned up. And considering how deep it was (looked like a hobby knife did it) we figured it would have bled. Our sheets are white and we found no blood stains.
<br><br>
He was sure that maybe a safety pin had gotten in our bed. But it was too straight and even to even consider that. We were both a little freaked, but I jokingly told him that's what he gets for not being respectful.
<br><br>
We were moving from NY to PA soon (first week July), so I was back and forth to my mom's house packing and trying to spend time with my mom before I left. I brought my board with me. I used it in my room (which became mine when I was 14, and before that was my mother's bedroom. I swear it has a lot of spirit energy, and some of it not so good...) D was drinking, but this time at least agreed to watch me.
<br><br>
Me: D Has a nasty cut on his stomach. He thinks it was a safety pin. I think otherwise. Does anyone know what happened?
<br><br>
(Later I realized saying &quot;anyone&quot; was probably my mistake that I attribute to in later events.)
<br><br>
Board: YES (moved to the word, and rather strongly at that, after maybe 3 minutes)
<br><br>
Me: Can you please tell me what happened?<br>
Board: (passes over 5 and 6 quickly) GOODBYE<br>
<br>
Me: Is there there someone else who can tell me?<br>
Board: (15 minutes no movement)<br>
Me: Alright. Thank you. Goodbye.<br>
<br>
I was... excited(?) that &quot;someone knew&quot; what happened, but bothered that they didn't want to tell me. It makes me think his cut was not caused by a tangible sharp item.
<br><br>
Early July we came to PA as planned, and I didn't bring my board. After a couple weeks I regretted it and decided to attempt making my own board using paper and a shot glass. Of course by myself...I used my homemade board twice. First with no luck (lasted 20 minutes) and the second time it went to &quot;G.&quot; I was home alone when I used it, so when D came back and all I heard was a door slamming I jumped and my fingers left the planchette...and for a good 10 minutes because I was explaining to him why I looked so jumpy. I came back and felt sick because I felt like I left improperly. I closed the board in the proper manner hoping it would have no negative consquences.
<br><br>
Mid July I was getting homesick, and we really needed to tie up some huge loose ends, so we went back for a week. I didn't get a chance to use the &quot;real&quot; board when I was there. The night before we had to leave again, we went to D's friend's house for a last minute going away party. He was plastered and I barely buzzed. We were to walk to our apartment and spend our final night there. On the way back is where I guess this story really picks up.
<br><br>
So we're walking, talking...and I hear whistling.<br>
&quot;D, did you hear that? Whistling?&quot;<br>
&quot;No. What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
<br>
The whistling...I swear I heard it.  It kept on for a good minute. I started getting hot in my face from fear. I tried telling D that I didn't like what I was hearing. Like it was evil or a sign of harm. Mid explanation I heard a sharp and hoarse, &quot;Psst HEY!&quot; and I felt like I was pushed. When I was getting up...it was odd. I couldn't help but notice I was pushed down in front of a house with the address &quot;333.&quot; I looked at my cell phone to make sure it wasn't damaged, and the time was 3:33 AM. The streetlight went out when I told D the time, and we were walking in darkness. I was feeling sick and scared. When we got to a lighted street, we passed three homes with cats just sitting on the porch. I felt even more ill and frightful when I looked the cats in the eye...but I felt I couldn't help it. One hissed and showed it's claws in our direction. One's fur stood up, and it's ears pointed back with almost evil eyes. The last cat did that growl thing angry cats do, and followed us a good 30 feet from it's home. I started saying Hail Mary's. I started to feel safe and calm after saying it like 30 times (wasn't really counting, but prayed until we reached the apartment safely.)
<br><br>
That night my dream was void of color. (I was once told by a man with a lot of religious handouts that colored dreams were God's way of talking to you.) Since my last night in NY I've had some fitful nightmares. And between dreams and nightmares, there is a serious lack of color.
<br><br>
End of July and back in PA. My board has been sitting in my room. My homemade on is in my dresser, but I haven't used it since the situation I last described. In September I am going to my mom's for a week. My best friend is coming back to town that time and has agreed to try the board with me when we get together.
<br><br>
But I am choosing to lay off until then. Perhaps what happened was just a bad string of coincidences (which is what D. Says) but I think, at least for now, it was some sort of warning or sign to back off.
<br><br>
I am disappointed that my experiences weren't as I hoped...but then again, you can't expect too much. Just be safe.
<br><br>
The end of my tale and the reason why I didn't try and get this story out sooner.  It is because I think I may know what &quot;G T&quot; could mean...I have this teddy bear that I had ever since I could remember. She was made in '86 (a year before my birth) and her little tag's serial number is 666. (I always joke on how she's my evil minion) She lives where I live (was at the apartment when I first used the board. Was at my mom's house. Guards my night stand since I've been in PA) and today I called her by her full name (yeah I talk to my bear when I feel homesick.  Her name is Ginger Teddy. Maybe whoever I contacted knew of my bear, her name, and her serial number...maybe they wanted to bring her up because of the number on her? I still don't know. But it struck me as a possibility.
