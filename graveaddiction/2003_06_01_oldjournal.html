I've decided I'm cursed when it comes to shopping.  I always try to pick the shortest line, and I almost always feel this sense of accomplishment for picking the line that will go the fastest.  Well, that is always a very false sense of accomplishment, because of my checkout line curse.  Like tonight, for example....I went to Meijer to pick up a few things I need for the summer reading program presentation.  I got to the checkout lanes and \picked the lane with the fewest number of people waiting, and also the line where the people had just a few items to check out instead of cart fulls.  But wouldn't you know it, all three people in front of me had some kind of problem checking out...their credit card wouldn't scan, a disagreement about a price, and a leaking water bottle...and the poor cashier didn't speak very good English.  I just stood and watched all of the people in the longer lines around me fly through the lines!  Now, I didn't blame the cashier for any of this, so when she started apologizing like crazy I told her it was no problem.  Well, then she started thanking me for my patience over and over, she thanked me at <i>least</i> ten times!  It's amazing how much happier my &quot;no problem&quot; response made her feel, it just goes to show it's the little things that count.<br /><br />Anyway, tomorrow is the big day...the ghost presentation for the summer reading program at Newark's Emerson Miller library.  I am soooooooooo nervous!  I don't think the presentation should scare any of the kids.  Well, a couple coworkers disagree with me about that.  I'm focusing the presentation of ghost hunting, so I listed a few places where you're likely to find ghosts.  Like cemeteries, historical places/museums, parks, churches, houses...and I also said &quot;even your own backyard&quot;.  I just want the kids to know that you don't have to travel far to go ghost hunting, you can find them everywhere.  Well, a couple coworkers thought the own backyard part is just too scary.  I totally disagree.  I loved that stuff when I was a kid, and I'm certain I wasn't <i>that</i> abnormal.  Also, my biggest argument against that being too scary is this...the PARENTS sign their children up for the presentations, and if they have a kid who is scared by stuff like this they should NOT sign the child up!!!  It's no fun for me to talk about wussy ghost stuff and spoil the fun for the majority of the kids who want to hear the scary stuff.  If saying that you can find ghosts in your own backyard is the scariest part of the presentation I'd have to say that it's a pretty mild presentation!  I'll try to get the presentation in HTML or PDF format within the next day or too and add it to the site so all of you can read it and let me know whether or not you agree with me or the select few coworkers.<br /><br />I just mentioned that I didn't think I was that abnormal.  Well, Saturday night one of the police officers who was working with me at Picnic with the Pops called me and the other person working the gate with me abnormal!!!!  All because we enjoy exploring abandoned buildings.  Sure it may not be an extremely common activity, but check out all of the sites on my <a href="links.html">links page</a>...we're definitely not the only people who like exploring these places!  And this police officer thought my cemetery addiction is abnormal too...now that's even more common than exploring abandoned buildings!!!!  Not only do &quot;urban explorers&quot; explore cemeteries, but so do a lot of genealogists.  I still laugh when I think of her calling me abnormal...whatever!  I think it just makes me more interesting!<br /><br />Well, I need to go and feed all of the wildlife now.  I'll blog again tomorrow to tell you how the presentation went...Wish me luck!!!!<br><br>

Yesterday was a busy day!  I ended up working from home - we have an objective to get one regression test plan each into TestDirector by the end of the month (this coming Monday).  Since I've been so busy working on all of the stuff for the Six Sigma project, I really hadn't had much of a chance to work on the regression test plan I was assigned.  I get a lot more accomplished from home since I can concentrate and have no interruptions.  I did get a lot done, I should be able to meet the deadline now.<br /><br />Last night I volunteered with the symphony again, Friday nights are Popcorn Pops.  In the past I've only volunteered for Picnic with the Pops, I was surprised at how different Popcorn Pops are.  The biggest difference was the amount of traffic through the gates - the gate I'm usually at for PWP is one of the slowest gates, but it's the total opposite on Popcorn nights!  It's one of the busiest!  I was assigned to help with ticket sales at that gate, but since ticket sales don't get really busy at that gate until 30 minutes after the gates open I was moved to another gate.  However, I was only at that gate for a short time, because yet another gate was getting bombarded with ticket sales - guess who got to go to that gate?!  So I helped there, and by the time the traffic died down I was called back to the first gate I was assigned to because they had a gigantic line.  It was busy, I usually don't run back and forth to the different gates like that.  But I did have fun, I love being busy!<br /><br />After I finished volunteering I stopped by John's place for a party.  I wasn't sure I would be able to make it since I never know for sure how late I'll be volunteering.  I'm so glad I got finished a little early though, his party was fun!  It's always nice to see all of the people I used to work with in Life and Health Systems!<br /><br />I left John's place around 9:45, and when I got home I crashed on the couch.  I decided that I should probably do some laundry though, late Friday and Saturday nights are the best time to do it since it's rare that the laundry room is packed at that time!  I love not having to wait for a washer or dryer.  Anyway, I was correct, no one else was doing their laundry.  So when I opened the door to the laundry room with my freshly washed and dried clothes, I was shocked when I saw a person walking right in front of the door...I just wasn't expecting to see anyone.  I didn't scream, but I did gasp and jump.  It was kinda funny when I saw who it was...just last week I scared/startled one of my neighbors in the laundry room.  He had all of the washers running, so he didn't hear me unlock the door or walk down the steps.  When he turned around he wasn't expecting to see anyone else.  Well, the neighbor that startled me last night was the same person!  Guess we're even now :)<br /><br />Other than that, I can't think of anything else.  Maybe I'll blog later this evening.<br><br>

My blog has been moved over to the new blogger...which is why I couldn't post last night.  I wasn't able to access my blogger account until the conversion was completed.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't have anything too exciting to write about anyway.  It's been really hot this week, in the high eighties, so I've been busy watering my plants.  So far I haven't lost any, but the leaves on the strawflowers are starting to look pretty ugly.  <br /><br />I was going through the million sites I've bookmarked, trying to clean my Favorites list up a little.   I found a lot of sites that I had totally forgotten about.  Like this one...<a href="http://www.gothic.net.au/~zeblick/poetry.html" target="blank">http://www.gothic.net.au/~zeblick/poetry.html</a>.  The poems on this site crack me up!!!  My two favorites are "Goth, Oh Moth Goth" and "Ode to Angst".<br><br>

I found out that if you do a yahoo search for &quot;pictures of frogs smoking pot&quot; my blog is the second search result displayed.  <br /><br />It makes me laugh when people find my site searching for things like that!<br><br>

I didn't get around to making an update to the site tonight (other than this blog entry, that is!)...however, I should have a <b>BIG, GIGANTIC</b> update either tomorrow night or Wednesday night.  Or maybe I'll do several small updates - I haven't decided yet.<br /><br />Anyway, the auction on Thursday wasn't too exciting.  The box lots mainly consisted of junk, and there were lots of dealers there so anything worth bidding on was going really high.  So my mom and I left about 30 minutes after the auction started.  I had my cameras with me (I ALWAYS have them with me!!) so we went to Sacred Heart Cemetery in Bremen.  My grandma's family (my mom's mom) grew up in Bremen, and this cemetery is located up at the top of a steep hill where we have our family reunions.  Every year since I was a kid we walked up to the cemetery after dinner...it was like the highlight of the family reunion!  Hmmm, maybe this annual trip to Sacred Heart Cemetery as a child helped develop my cemetery addiction?!?!?!?!?  Anyway, Sacred Heart is on a desolate gravel road and it's an awesome cemetery.  I took plenty of pictures, so instead of going into too much detail describing it you'll just have to wait until I have the photos added to the site! :)<br /><br />Anyway, after we went to Sacred Heart Cemetery we drovw down State Route 664 towards Logan.  On our way there we found two other old cemeteries, Mount Tabor and Pleasant Hill.  After stopping to take pictures we stopped and ate at the <a href="http://www.oldedutch.com" target="blank">Olde Dutch</a> restaurant.  Then we went to the <a href="http://www.garden-accents.com" target="blank">Garden Accents Factory Outlet</a> to look for some ceramic stuff for my mom's garden.  They had a lot of neat things, plus I was very excited when I saw that they had a historic kiln,"Old Number 14", that you could visit.  It was built in the 1920's and it really was interesting.  I took pictures of that too :)<br /><br />After buying some stepping stones at Garden Accents we headed home.  But on the way my mom decided to stop at Leota's place - Leota weaves baskets and sells basket making supplies...as well as other odds and ends.  Leota's place is at the top of a hill near Rockbridge.  We don't make it down that way too often, so it was fun to stop by.  Mom found a basket that she liked, and I found two glass Fenton candle holders....for only $2.00 each!!!  That's a <b>really</b> good deal for Fenton!!!!!!   So I was pretty excited about that.<br /><br />Shortly after we got back to my parents' place, my dad and sister got home from work.  We went to dinner, then I went back to their place and played with the wiener dogs for awhile.<br /><br />I also had Friday off.  I just cleaned and stuff during the day.  Well, actually my morning sucked.  I got a call from the complex manager saying that the check I wrote for June's rent was returned.  I totally freaked out, because I knew I had enough to cover the rent!  I called the bank and after several minutes I found out that they made a mistake...or rather "the person who clears the checks was having a bad day"...and the check was returned in error.  Needless to say, I was pissed!!!  But they got everything fixed at least.  After driving to the bank, I decided I needed to go shopping to get my mind off of everything.  I went and bought potting soil and some moss so I could turn an antique egg basket into an herb planter.  It looks nice, I'll have to take some pictures of it.<br /><br />Friday night I volunteered at the first <a href="http://www.picnicwiththepops.com" target="blank">Picnic with the Pops</a> of the season.  It was a lot of fun, but it wasn't very busy.  I do ticket sales at one of the gates, so since there is money there, the symphony hires police officers to sit with us at all of the gates.  I had fun talking to the two police officers that were at my gate...we talked about all sorts of things....anything from trucks to officers having to get flea baths after going into infested houses!!!<br /><br />Saturday night I volunteered at the Pops again.  My parents volunteer with me on Saturday nights, we had fun that night too.<br /><br />I'm finally at the end of the weekend...Sunday I drove over to the Zanesville-New Concord area to visit a few cemeteries that a person e-mailed me directions to - Crooked Creek and Carr-Ebenezer Cemeteries.  They were both really old and really big.  And her directions were perfect, I didn't get lost at all!  I also stopped at a covered bridge that was on the way to one of the cemeteries.  I got the pictures back tonight, I'll hopefully get them added to the site soon too.<br /><br />It was really hard to go back to work today.  Four days away from the office is a long time!  But I made it through the day, and I'm ready to tackle tomorrow...I forgot that I told my manager I'd do a presentation on HTT (High Throughput Testing) for our team meeting.  I'm not too worried about it, I'll be able to throw something together tomorrow!<br /><br />Anyway, I feel like I've been blogging for hours now, so I'm going to call it a night!<br><br>

I had another fun day at work.  Michelle and I talked about all of the strange things that go on in my apartment, and we also talked about the <a href="ouija.html">ouija stories</a> that I have out here on the site.  I didn't know that any of my coworkers read them!  That's not a bad thing, it's actually pretty cool!  She was telling me that when she was growing up, the toilet would mysteriously flush when she was alone in the house.  She'd also smell perfume in that bathroom...a scent that none of her family wore.  That would be really strange too!  <br /><br />I also spent part of my afternoon talking to Lina about music.  Occasionally she'll burst into song at her desk, loud enough that I can hear her (I sit across the aisle from her).  I was really surprised when I recognized the songs she was singing though, FINALLY there is someone on my team that listens to the same type of music.  Michelle listens to rock/metal (whatever you want to call it) too, but she's not technically on my team.  It's really nice that Lina listens to the same stuff, because now when Sheri gives me a hard time about listening to "evil" music in our team meetings, I'll have someone to stick up for me! :)<br /><br />I can't remember if I mentioned it or not, but I think I did...I'm doing a presentation on ghosts at one of the Newark libraries on July 1st.  I told Stefanie that I'd do it back in April, and back then it seemed so far away.  Today it hit me...I have less than 2 weeks before I give an hour long presentation to approximately 20 kids, ranging from 3-12 years old!!!!!!  I'm a little nervous about it, I'm afraid that I might scare some of the younger kids.  Wait, let me clarify that...I'm not worried that I <i>personally</i> will scare them, but rather the subject matter I'm presenting!!!  I don't want to totally gear the presentation for the little kids though either, because I'd hate to bore the older ones.  I have some ideas though, and after telling Kitty and Misty my ideas, I feel much better.  They're both moms (Misty even has three kids that cover the entire age range that I'm presenting to), and they think the presentation should appeal to all of the kids.  Hopefully they'll be right!<br /><br />OK, in last night's post I talked about the planchette moving across the ouija board and falling on the floor (if you don't know what I'm talking about scroll down!).  I was telling Michelle about that, and I realized I told her something that I should've told all of you readers.  After I picked up the ice cold planchette, I freaked out.  I dropped the planchette back on the floor and ran into another room!  About ten minutes later I went back into the living room and put the planchette back on the board.  I left the running away part out on purpose! :)  However, Michelle thought that was interesting/amusing because she thought all of the strange things happening here didn't bother me since I never write about my reactions.  So I decided to tell all of you this so you know that yes, the paranormal things happening here do indeed bother me!  However, even though it still freaks me out, I do kind of expect it.  <br /><br />I'm going to an auction tomorrow, so hopefully I'll find lots of cheap, wonderful things!  I'll be sure to let you know if I find any treasures!<br><br>

At least I know that when I die I'll have a few extra minutes before I'm thrown into the fiery pits of hell!  Read on...<br /><br /><blockquote>A curious fellow died one day and found himself waiting in the long line of judgment. As he stood there he noticed that some souls were allowed to march right through the pearly gates into Heaven.<br /><br />Others though, were led over to Satan who threw them into the burning pit. But every so often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the fire, Satan would toss a soul off to one side into a small pile.<br /><br />After watching Satan do this several times, the fellow's curiosity got the best of him. So he strolled over and asked Satan what he was doing. "Excuse me, Mr. Prince of Darkness," he said. "I'm waiting in line for judgment, but I couldn't help wondering, why are you tossing those people aside instead of flinging them into the Fires of Hell with the others?"<br /><br />"Ah, those . . ." Satan said with a groan. "They're all from  Ohio . They're still too cold and wet to burn."</blockquote><br><br>

I've read on several ghost related sites that a change in state will sometimes result in strange paranormal activity.  For example, if you bring an antique rocking chair home with you from a house that it had sat in for several years, that is a change of state.  Well, it doesn't seem to take a very big change of state to get the paranormal activity in my house going!  Last night I framed and hung up an Army Air Corps group photo from 1945 that belonged to my great uncle.  I've had the photo in my house for several weeks.  Well, the simple act of hanging it on the wall was enough to cause strange things to happen.  Two times this evening I looked and the photo was moved across the hall, <i>off of the wall</i>, on the floor propped up against the wall.  I know no one else is moving it, because it's happened while I've been alone in the apartment!!  If it had fallen of the wall it wouldn't have made it clear across the hall, let alone land propped up against the wall!  Also, the planchette on the 1920's ouija board has been moving on it's own again.  I was watching <i>We Were Soldiers</i> this evening.  After the I finished watching the movie I called my mom and told her what I thought about it (I thought it was an <b>excellent</b> movie!), and about the time I was hanging up the phone I heard a scraping sound on the table.  I looked over and the planchette was moving.  And not just shaking, actually moving!  This was the first time I've actually seen something being moved like this.  It didn't spell anything out, it just slowly moved across the board and fell on the floor.  I picked it up and it felt cold, like ice.  I have to admit this really freaked me out.  The ceiling fan wasn't on, so I can't blame that (not that it would be strong enough to move the big wooden planchette anyway).  The board was laying flat, so I can't rationalize it by blaming it on that either.  Strange stuff, wonder how well I'll sleep tonight?!?!?!<br /><br />Speaking of sleep, I really haven't been sleeping well.  I've been having really strange dreams.  A few nights ago I dreamed that I was going blind in my left eye.  It was watering - more like seeping - and no one could figure out what was wrong with it.  Finally a doctor pulled my eyelid back and there was a gigantic tick attached to my eye.  The doctor told me I was going to be blind in that eye for the rest of my life because the tick sucked all of the blood out of it and there was no way to get blood circulating in my eye ever again.  Also, he said there was no way to remove the tick, I'd just have to wait until it fell off.  Talk about a nightmare!  <br /><br />Yesterday I attended a meeting (for my manager since he couldn't make it) with our division manager, systems officer, and Six Sigma blackbelt to talk about our plan to automate a test plan for the next release.  Mike, the systems officer, said to move forward with it so that's my newest assignment.  I'm really quite excited about it, it's helping me enjoy my days at work more.  I'm also going to have a person from the service center shadow me so she can learn more about Business Analyst/Systems Analyst job roles/responsibilities.  That'll be fun too! <br><br>

Here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="blank">This-or-That</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Newspapers or magazines?</b><br>I'd have to say newspapers.  There are lots of interesting articles and there aren't as many ads to flip through!<br /><li><b>Books-on-tape or regular books?</b><br>Definitely regular books<br /><li><b>Paperback or hardcover?</b><br>I honestly don't have a preference.  I guess I like hardcover best if I'm buying a book by one of my favorite authors, just because the hardcovers hold up better over time.<br /><li><b>Fiction or non-fiction?</b><br>Fiction most of the time<br /><li><b>Sci-Fi/Fantasy or romance novels?</b><br>Sci-Fi/Fantasy....romance novels make me laugh!<br /><li><b>Borrow from library or buy books (either new or used)?</b><br>I don't make it to the library too much since parking is such a pain, so I buy a lot of books.<br /><li><b>Subscribe to magazines or buy on newsstand?</b><br>Since I don't read any on a regular basis I just buy them at the grocery store.<br /><li><b>Current best-sellers or classic literature?</b><br>Usually I like current best-sellers best.  Some of the classics are fantastic, but a lot of them bore me.<br /><li><b>Read books once, or re-read favorites every so often?</b><br>Sometimes I'll re-read favorites, but I don't do that too often since there are so many new books that interest me.<br /><li><b>Here in the U.S., we have two hot best-sellers...former First Lady Hillary Clinton's memoirs, and the new Harry Potter book (coming out June 21). If you had to read one, which one...Hillary or Harry? Why?</b><br>I'm not planning to read either, but if I HAD to choose one I'd go for Hillary Clinton's memoirs....I've never been able to get into the Harry Potter craze.  I read the first book and wasn't overly impressed with it.  It was OK, but I didn't like it enough to bother with the second book.<br /></ol><br />I'll post a longer entry this afternoon!<br><br>

It rained today, so I didn't get to go to the flea market or the Washboard Festival or any cemeteries.  It cleared up this afternoon, but by that time I was occupied doing things around the apartment.  My mom gave me some clary sage and chamomile plants that she grew from seed, so I planted those.  I tried to sweep the patio too, but the ground was just too wet.  It looks like the weather is supposed to be decent until Wednesday, that should give everything outside a chance to dry off.  <br /><br />Since talking about cleaning my apartment would be boring, I won't go into details.  But that was pretty much all I did today, so I guess I'll end this post now and (hopefully) blog about more interesting things tomorrow!<br><br>

It was another rainy day here in Columbus.  Last night on the news they said that we only only had 5 days without rain in May, and so far it's rained nine out of 13 days in June.  I love rainy days, but even I am getting a little tired of the wet weather!!  It looks like tomorrow afternoon and Sunday might be nice, but then they're calling for more rain.  But with the wet ground, high humidity, and hot temperatures that's not too surprising really.<br /><br />I think I might go to the flea market again tomorrow, it all depends on the weather.  And since the flea market is just north of Logan, I might go to the Logan Washboard festival too.  It'll probably be awful to me - lots of country crafts and bluegrass music - but it might be fun at the same time.  I definitely want to take pictures at a few cemeteries tomorrow too, I haven't done that for almost two weeks!  But other than that, I don't have any other plans.  Hopefully tomorrow won't be too rainy!!<br><br>

What a crazy day!  The craziness started right away this morning, even before I went to work.  I woke up about 25 minutes before my normal waking time because I thought it sounded like something fell in my room.  I looked around briefly in my half awake/half asleep state and didn't notice anything out of place so I cursed under my breath about waking up before I needed to and laid back down.  I didn't get to sleep for long though...about 3 minutes before my alarm would have gone off, I heard a rustling sound...like something crinkling paper under my dresser.   At first I thought nothing of it, but then I suddenly I thought "Oh my god, I have a mouse under my dresser"!!!!  A few seconds passed before I started to panic too much (I'm not scared of mice but I'm not really prepared to catch any) when I suddenly had another thought....it probably wasn't a mouse, it was probably an African Clawed Frog (the totally aquatic ones).  I got up and looked in the aquarium.  Sure enough, Joan was nowhere to be seen!  I took both of the bottom dresser drawers out and checked there first, but there was nothing under there.  For the next 15-20 minutes I tore up the rest of my bedroom looking for the lost frog.  I couldn't find her anywhere!  I kept remembering the rustling/crinkling sound I heard under the dresser, so I reluctantly decided to pull the heavy dresser out from the wall.  I saw Joan crammed into the narrow little space between the dresser and the wall, she had managed to climb up off the floor far enough that I wasn't able to see her by just taking out the bottom drawers.  The rustling paper sound must have been her climbing against a receipt that had fallen behind the dresser.  As soon as I touched her she started to jump...and even though these frogs live in the water only, therefore swimming instead of jumping, they can really jump FAST when they escape the aquarium...I chased her around the room for 5-10 minutes until I was finally able to catch her AND prevent her from slipping out of my hands!  Since she didn't appear dried out at all, she must have just escaped recently (that's probably what woke me up the first time).  She had a couple of small scratches, but other than that she was fine.  Of course, I wasn't expecting to play "Frog Rescue 911" this morning, so I was running around like crazy trying to get ready so I could make it to work on time!  I did make it, I was only 3 minutes late.  When I walked into my area and said good morning to Brenda she asked me if it was raining outside...I had to explain that no, it wasn't raining - I just didn't have time to use the hairdrier so that's why it looked like I had just come inside after being caught in a downpour!! :)  You'd think that African Clawed Frogs would have some kind of natural instinct to prevent them from leaving the water since they shrivel up into hard little skeletons if they're out of the water for too long. <br /><br />My work day went really fast.  I showed Ben, my manager, the test case we automated yesterday.  I couldn't tell if he was excited about it or not.  Then I told a bunch of coworkers my frog escape story.  Then I did some work, and before I knew it, it was already lunch time.  I went out with Brenda, Heather, Stacie, and Carol.  It was a really good lunch, but I must admit that I felt a little out of place during most of the conversations -  Heather, Stacie, and Carol all have young children so the discussions about teething and baby talk weren't too thrilling for me!  But it was fun anyway.  Then I went back to my <strike>prison cell</strike> cubicle and got back to work.  I looked at the clock, thinking I still had lots of time left in the day...but it was time to go.  I love days like this that go by fast!<br /><br />I installed some new dial-up software on my work computer here at home tonight.  I was expecting things to go horribly since the computer is an old piece of junk and I usually have problems with installing new things on it.  The only problem I ran into was that the PC had to have NT Service Pack 6a on it for the software to install, and it only had NT Service Pack 5.  It would have been nice to have known that upfront so I wouldn't have wasted 30 minutes only to get a popup error at the end of the software installation saying it couldn't install.  But I got the service pack installed and then the new software installed too.  I was able to connect to the Nationwide network and access all of the applications I need, so it really wasn't as painful as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I haven't experienced any ghostly activity in the apartment yet tonight....of course, I haven't been out of the computer room for a few hours, who knows what I might find moved around in the other rooms! :)<br><br>

Today was a great day!  Work was good because of that test case Pat helped me automate.  I can't wait to write scripts for even more test cases!  I &quot;forced&quot; a couple of people, Cindy and Kitty, to watch the test case that we automated.  I'm sure they were like "wow that's so exciting, can I pleeease go back to my desk now???"  I couldn't help it though, I found this so exciting and it was so nice to have a good day at work...it's been along time since I've had one of those! <br /><br />This afternoon Chrissie e-mailed me and asked if my schedule was free for dinner tonight.  I didn't have anything planned and since it's been at <i>least</i> a month since I had really talked to her I agreed to go.  We went to Cap City, one of our favorite restaurants, and had a terrific dinner.  And of course we saved room for the &quot;serious chocolate cake&quot;, which we refer to as the big ass chocolate cake.  It's gigantic, 3 people could <i>easily</i> split it and still be miserable from eating too much.  We got to gossip about people too, so it was a fun night!  <br /><br />My &quot;roomates&quot;, AKA the ghosts, have been quite active tonight.  I've had all sorts of things moved around the living room, all of the books I have stacked on the coffee table were lined up in front of it when I got home, and all of them were laying face down open to the last page.  Also, all of the spoons were lined up on the counter.  No other utensils, just spoons.  Also, all of the stuff in my shower (shampoo bottles, soap, body wash, etc) were lined up in front of the bathtub.  The blue chair in my computer room was moved into my bedroom.  Again, there was no one else in the house at the time who could have done this.  And I'm sure none of the frogs could have lifted the chair :)  Maybe I should just go ahead and take some excederin PM now so I can be sure that I'll be able to get some sleep!  I swear, if other people (like my sister and the psychic) hadn't experienced strange things here I'd think I was going crazy!!<br><br>

I've felt this strange desire to answer some <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="blank">This-or-That</a> questions all morning.  Since I didn't feel I could answers today's questions (see below), I decided to answer some of the past ones that were posted before I found out about the site.  So here's my answers to an older list that I didn't have the chance to answer before:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Packrat or minimalist?</b><br>Even though I wish I wasn't, I'm definitely a packrat.  I have a terrible time getting rid of old things.  Also, I'm always hauling new stuff home from auctions, flea markets, etc so my collections keep growing, and growing, and growing....!!<br /><li><b>Computer: desktop or laptop?</b><br>My personal computer is a laptop, and my work computer is a desktop.  Both are IBMs.  Well, I do have the Acer too, that's the surplus PC I use to work from home.  It's an awful computer though, so I don't like to talk about it!<br /><li><b>Seashore or mountains?</b><br>I like mountains best.<br /><li><b>Carpeting or bare floors?</b><br>My apartment is carpeted, but I like hardwood best.  I personally think it looks nicer.  Also, I would rather sweep than vacuum.  Vacuuming is definitely the chore I hate most, because I always manage to suck up things that I shouldn't, like extension cords, rubber bands, big strings, loose change, etc.<br /><li><b>Drinking water: bottled or tap?</b><br>I guess I'd have to say bottled, sometimes tap water can taste too much like chlorine or some other chemical taste.  And then there's well water, the only way I can drink that is for it to be sent through a reverse osmosis system!<br /><li><b>Shopping websites: eBay or Amazon?</b><br>eBay, I like the excitement of bidding.<br /><li><b>Cute little kitties or big scary tigers?</b><br>Definitely big scary tigers, I like scary things!<br /><li><b>Front door or back door?</b><br>I always go in the front door, unless I go over to someone's house and they tell me to use the back door.<br /><li><b>Lots of jewelry, or little/none?</b><br>Little/None.  I usually only wear my watch.  But I HAVE to wear the watch, I feel lost without it!<br /><li><b>Thought-provoking question of the week: At the last minute, you obtain tickets to an event you're dying to attend. However, you have to work that day! Do you ask the boss for the time off, or just call in sick? </b><br>I'd ask my manager for the time off...but if he didn't let me take time off I might <i>mysteriously</i> become terribly sick!<br /></ol>With a TON of help, I wrote my area's first automated test case on WinRunner....it's been such an exciting day!  <br /><i>Note to Chrissie: Yes, I realize that getting excited about automating a test case does make me a geek!</i> :)<br><br>

Today is <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="blank">This or That Tuesday</a>, but I've decided not to answer the questions this week...they're all about TV shows and movies, and since I've never watched a lot of TV I haven't even seen 98% of the shows on the list!  So I'll just go ahead and resume the weekly questions next week.<br /><br />In place of the This-or-That list of questions/answers, here's a list of referrals to my blog (from the past week):<br /><ul><br /><li>"Pink Eye Home Remedies" (via <a href="http://www.google.com" target="blank">Google</a>) - Well, at least I know which entry has caused people to find the blog with this search.  However, no remedies here....just an entry with me discussing how my coworkers overreact to red eyes.  This referral has shown up a bunch in the referral logs, pink eye must really be going around right now.<br /><li>"Pink Eye in Dogs" (via <a href="http://www.google.com" target="blank">Google</a>) - See explanation above.  I don't have any info about dogs having pink eye out here either.<br /><li>"Twisted Mind" (via <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="blank">Yahoo</a>) - Now this a referral I can definitely understand - since the title of my blog is "Inside Beth's <b>Twisted Mind</b>"!<br /><li>"Dirty Fish Tank" (via <a href="http://www.google.com" target="blank">Google</a>) - I'm not sure if it's a good thing that people are finding my blog looking for this!  My fish tank is dirty a lot, but it's not something I'm proud of at all!  <br /></ul><br />It felt so humid outside this morning.  I think we're supposed to have thunderstorms this afternoon and for the next few days.  I love rain, but even I'm getting a little tired of it.  A nice, sunny day would be wonderful right now.  I thought Sunday was going to be a nice day weather wise, but I was wrong.  I went to Meijer in Hilliard around 2:00 on Sunday afternoon.  It was a beautiful day, lots of sun.  I was in the store for maybe 30 minutes.  When I got outside it was dark and it started to rain.  It wasn't raining hard though so I continued walking to my parking spot towards the end of the lot.  About halfway to the car it started pouring!!!  The wind was really strong, and it was a very cold rain.  I was soaked and so were my groceries.  I think that was the moment I decided I was tired of all the rain we've been having lately!<br><br>

It was another gray, dreary, rainy day here in Central Ohio.  But that was OK, I had fun anyway!!  I ended up going to the Hocking Hills Farmer's Flea Market, the second time I've gone down there this year.  Since it was such an ugly day there weren't quite as many vendors set up.  I did find one wonderful, exciting deal though.  I noticed two Anchor Hocking Early American Prescut iced tea glasses sitting on a table.  The book price on these is about $25.00, and since these glasses were popular it's difficult to find them, especially ones that aren't cracked or stained.  The two I saw were in perfect condition, and they didn't have any price tags on them.  I asked the lady in charge of the booth how much she was asking for them, I was totally expecting at least $15 each.  However, she just wanted <b>ONE DOLLAR each</b>!!!!  So I got two EAPC glasses for only two dollars!!!!  That made my whole trip down there worth it!  Also, my mom bought me an old egg basket.  She has one that she got from my grandma, and she turned it into a planter.  I would like to do the same thing.  I'll be sure to take and post a picture of the egg basket, just in case some of you don't know what I'm talking about.<br><br>

Tim left a comment in my last post that said "one day I think it would be hilarious if someone misplaced Beth's Manson with bluegrass".  That would be sooooo evil, but one time someone did something kinda like that to me at work.  It was back in 1999 when I still worked on the CyberLife project in Life and Health Systems.  Can't say I liked the area, but I did work with some cool people.  The guy I sat by, Tony, was hilarious.  We both had very different tastes when it came to music.  He was always giving me a hard time about the stuff I listened to, and one day while I was away from my desk at a meeting he switched the Marilyn Manson CD that was in my CD player with the <i>Dawson's Creek</i> soundtrack!!  When I pressed the play button I was expecting to hear "The Reflecting God", but instead I heard "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer....I'm sure you can imagine how shocked I was!  <br /><br />The other funny music related thing we did in that area involved putting signs on people's desks.  One Friday there were only four of us in the office in the little aisle of cubicles I sat in.  Laurie was working on a training presentation, and she was using of of those big, gigantic notepad things instead of a powerpoint presentation.  Well, Tony took a piece of paper from the notepad, wrote "Beth loves Barry Manilow" on it, and then hung it on the front of my cube.  I took a piece of the big paper and wrote "Tony adores Marilyn Manson" for his cube.  We decided Beth (not me - the other one!) and Laurie needed signs too!  For Beth's we made one that said "Beth loves John Mellencamp" - she hates John Mellencamp because her husband listens to it ALL the time!  We had a difficult time thinking of a musician Laurie hated because she didn't know most of the people we mentioned.  So we ended up writing "Busta Rhymes can bust a move on me anytime"!  We thought our signs were pretty funny.  Then the director walked down our aisle and gave us all dirty looks.  A few minutes later one of the managers came over and told us we needed to take down the signs because the director thought they were tasteless!  Some people just have no sense of humor!!<br><br>

At the end of every day this week I've thought "wow, this day went by so fast"...however, it feels like the week has lasted for an eternity.  I don't understand.  It's been a good week though.  I've been really unhappy at work lately, well maybe not unhappy - just frustrated.  But since there are a few coworkers who visit the site occasionally I'm not going to get into why I feel this way ;)  My manager knows why, I'll just have to see if he does anything about it!  Anyway, it looks like we may get to start working on automating some of our regression test plans, and I get to be the person who works on the software evaluation/pilot.  That is very exciting news for me, I love working on new assignments like this.  So maybe I'll stop dreading the thought of going to work every morning!<br /><br />I cleaned the fish tank tonight, the water was looking really murky and disgusting.  It's still a little cloudy, but in a few hours it'll look nice and clear.  And the plants were very happy too, they got watered with the dirty fish tank water.  I never need to use Miracle Grow, fish tank water has just as much fertilizer!<br /><br />Someone found my blog while searching on "crack TestDirector" again.  I wonder exactly what kind of information they're looking for?  We use TestDirector at work, but I can honestly say I've never thought about cracking into the code or databases behind it.  And my friends say that I'm a geek...at least I don't look for information on software I use at work when I'm surfing the internet at home!! :)<br /><br />My mom and I were "twins" at work today....we both ended up wearing the same shirt!!!  It's just a basic, navy blue shirt with 4 buttons.  We both have the exact same shirt, but this was the first time I forgot to call her before I decided wear it.  It's only happened twice counting today, but I hate wearing the same shirt as her on the same day.  When it happens and people see us together they go on and on about how cute it is that we dress alike, etc and it drives me CRAZY!  I don't think I'll ever plan on wearing that shirt to work again!<br /><br />Well, that's about it for tonight.  Hopefully my life won't continue to be so boring!<br><br>

I get tons of forwards at work, and I've seen the one with the list of home remedies a thousand times...you know, the one where they tell you to wipe your pets with bounce sheets to make them smell better, etc.  Well today I got a list that made me laugh!<br /><br /><b>Home Remedies That Work</b><br /><ol><br /><li>If you are choking on an ice cube, don't panic.  Simply pour a cup of boiling water down your throat and presto!  The blockage will be almost instantly removed.<br /><li>Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing vegetables by getting someone else to hold them while you chop away.<br /><li>Avoid arguments with the mrs. about lifting the toilet seat by simply using the sink.<br /><li>High blood pressure sufferers: simply cut yourself and bleed for a while, thus reducing the pressure in your veins.<br /><li>A mouse trap, placed on top of your alarm clock, will prevent you from rolling over and going back to sleep when you hit the snooze button.<br /><li>If you have a bad cough, take a large dose of laxatives, then you will be afraid to cough.<br /><li>Have a bad tooth ache? Hit your thumb with a hammer, then you will forget about the toothache.<br /></ol><br />I'll post again later this evening.<br /><br><br>

Thought I'd go ahead and make a short post.  It really wasn't an eventful day, so I don't have a ton to talk about.  I did make several updates to the main part of the site this evening though.  I added new pages (that you can see <a href="newstuff.html">here</a>) and even two new sections - a <a href="articles.html">"Cemeteries and Historic Places in the News"</a> section and an <a href="funpages.html"> "Odds & Ends"</a> section.  The Odds & Ends are nothing new for all of you regular readers.  They're mainly just old Hoppy Together pages that sort of fit on this site.<br /><br />I read the funniest blog post ever tonight - go and check out <a href="http://brendoman.com/houseofslug/">Luis' blog</a> and read his latest post about bored suburban kids.  It's great.  Also, one of the phrases he used in his this-or-that answers made me laugh too...the one about birds being "disease carrying rats on wings"!  He's soooo right about that, I totally agree!<br /><br />Anyway, since I don't have anything else even remotely interesting to write about, I'm going to call it a night.<br><br>

I think I must be allergic to my work environment.  Today while I was at work my right eye was extremely red.  I wouldn't have noticed because it didn't itch, it wasn't sore...it just felt normal.  However, everyone else noticed and made a really big deal about it.  Yeah, it did look a little awful, but I don't think it looked like my eye was going to fall out or anything major like that!  My coworker Karen was really concerned about it because one of the programmers in our department went home yesterday with pink eye.  First, I didn't even see Richard in passing yesterday.  Second, your eyes get all...what's the word I'm looking for..."gloppy" (that's the word Kitty used!).  My mom said people with pink eye usually get a thin film over their eye, and mine were just red, not gloppy or filmy.  Also, I remember having pink eye when I was a kid and I remember my eyes feeling really itchy.  However, I was a little worried about it.  I'd hate to infect everyone I work with if I did have it!  The only good thing about having pink eye would be that I'd HAVE to stay home :)  Anyway, less than fifteen minutes after I left the building I looked in the rearview mirror and my eye was no longer red...not even a little red.  So that proves I don't have pink eye, because I know for a fact that pink eye doesn't go away that fast!<br /><br />Well, enough about my eye.  It was a rather boring day at work.  I can't think of anything exciting or interesting that happened.  It wasn't a bad day though either.  Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't have to clean or do anything tonight, so maybe I can get to bed at a decent time!  <br><br>

I added a new blog to my list of interesting blogs: <a href="http://gardenofshadows.blogspot.com/" target="blank">From out of the Shadows</a>.  This is David's blog, he is the <a href="http://cemetery-art.netfirms.com/" target="blank">Garden of Shadows</a> webmaster (another GREAT cemetery website).  <br /><br />Before I forget, here are my <a href="http://www.this-or-that.org" target="blank">This-or-That</a> answers of the week:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Cats or dogs?</b><br>Dogs, they seem to be more loyal and loving than cats.<br /><li><b>Butterflies or birds?</b><br>Definitely butterflies, I really dislike birds.  I think birds are filthy animals!<br /><li><b>Horses or cows?</b><br>Hmmm, this is a difficult one.  I guess I'd have to say cows because they seem friendlier and more laid back.  Also, even though I've been kicked by calves on several occasions, their kicking was still less painful than the time I got thrown off a horse!<br /><li><b>Turtles or snakes?</b><br>I guess I'd have to say snakes.  They're more active than turtles, plus I think they look cooler.<br /><li><b>Frogs or grasshoppers?</b><br>As if I even have to tell you!!  Frogs, of course!<br /><li><b>Lions or tigers?</b><br>...or bears, oh my!  I guess tigers, I like stripes.<br /><li><b>Elephants or mice?</b><br>Elephants, I like their big ears.<br /><li><b>Porcupines or aardvarks?</b><br>Porcupines are sooo cute!<br /><li><b>Unicorns or dragons?</b><br>Definitely dragons, being able to breathe fire is way cool!<br /><li><b>Thought-provoking question of the week: You live in a rather dumpy apartment. A friend offers you a chance to be a roommate at a new place s/he is moving into, but they don't allow pets. You have a pet. Do you find your pet a new home and take the new place, or do you keep your pet and stay put?</b><br>I'd keep my pet and stay put.  Chances are I'd eventually be able to find a better apartment that allowed pets, so I'd wait it out.  Pets can be like family, you just can't get rid of them that easily!<br /></ol><br /><br><br>

Hahahaha, check out the comments from yesterday's 12:47PM post....there was actually a little conversation about <b>bluegrass</b> in <b>MY</b> blog!!!  Anyone who knows my taste in music probably thought hell would freeze over before bluegrass was mentioned in my blog!  I can't wait to tell my coworkers about this, their reactions will be priceless!<br /><br />Speaking of music, the other day when I bought the Smile Empty Soul CD I also bought the newest Finch CD.  I had heard "What it is to Burn" on the radio and really liked it, and since the CD was really cheap in the "emerging artists" section I decided to give it a try.  I'm really glad I did, it's an awesome CD!<br><br>

I survived the day, even though the very faint icing stain on my shirt (read last entry) bugged me all day.  The afternoon flew by, mainly because I had lots of meetings.  I helped conduct my second BADP (Business Analyst Development Program) interview, and then I went to a Six Sigma meeting that consisted of a testing software demo.  I think the BADP interviews were my favorite part of the day - I've always been the person being interviewed, this was my first time actually interviewing someone.  So far this whole BADP thing has been quite a learning experience.  <br /><br />I've finished most of my cleaning, I just have a few things left to do (like my laundry - gotta wash the shirt I messed up today!).  I just love clean houses, it's one of the best feelings in the world.  <br /><br />Everyone loved the lemon lime cake and the fruit salad.  But what they loved most was my Anchor Hocking Jadeite 2000 cake pan.  It is a wonderful pan, and it was only $9.99 at Meijer back in January!  I'm not 100% sure why everyone loves it so much, but I think it's the pale green color.  A lot of people have never seen a green glass pan.  If only it were an <i>antique</i> jadeite cake pan, that would be even better!  Of course, if it was antique jadeite it would've been at least triple the price and therefore I <b>definitely</b> wouldn't be baking with it!!!  It would be lovingly displayed on a shelf instead :)<br><br>

What a perfect way to start out a Monday...lemon lime cakes are one of the heaviest single layer cakes ever.  When I shut the truck door this morning, the edge of the cake pan hit my chest.  I didn't think anything of it since it was covered in foil, but when I looked down at my shirt I had a <b>gigantic</b> line of pale yellow icing on my shirt...guess I didn't ice the cake very neatly and I got some on the edge of the pan.  I sat the cake down on the hood of the truck and wiped the big globs of icing off my shirt.  However, it did leave a faint mark on my shirt that looks just awful.  People probably think I don't wash my clothes or something.  Well, actually most people said that they didn't even notice until I pointed it out to them, but I think they're just trying to be nice!  If my sister worked at the same building she'd be laughing at me all day...she always finds it extremely amusing when drop things on my clothes.  <br /><br />Other than that it has been a pretty good Monday though.  Hopefully the last few hours will be just as good as the first few.<br><br>

I didn't have a headache today, but I still didn't get around to any web updates...maybe tomorrow!  I also didn't get all of the cleaning that I wanted to get done finished either.  I did get the patio cleaned, plus I did a lot of baking!  I remembered this afternoon that I promised to bring in treats for Brenda's birthday tomorrow.  I made a big fruit salad (with watermelon, cantelope, honeydew, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and red raspberries) and a lemon lime cake.  Actually, I made two lemon lime cakes - one for work and one for me and my family!  Lemon lime cake is my absolute favorite, especially when it's warm outside.  This was the first time I ever made it, so I was a little worried that I'd manage to mess something up, but they turned out fine.  I don't think mine taste as good as the ones my mom makes even though it is the same recipe.  But really, I think things always taste better when someone else makes them.  OK, maybe not always - as long as the person is a decent cook they taste better!<br /><br />I bought the new Smile Empty Soul CD.  I listened to the whole thing, and I really like it!  I also listened to Marilyn Manson's newest CD while I was baking and cleaning today.  I love that CD, especially the song (s)AINT.  <br /><br />Other than that, it was a pretty boring day.  I can't believe it's already June, this year has really been flying by fast!<br><br>
