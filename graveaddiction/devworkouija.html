On May 7, 2007 I received an e-mail from an anonymous visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My adventure started by losing a cousin that was like a sister to me, and being the only child it was devastating. Four years later, I decided to try an Ouija board with friends. It moved a round a lot, sent us out to see certain areas that were strange and already a myth where we lived, such as a college for women, and they were all killed by a crazy man (the crazy man was the person the board said we were talking to and his name was Rastis).
<br><br>
I dedcided to buy my own and play by myself...that was my second mistake, the first was buying the board. The first several times I played the board nothing would happen and I got mad. I wanted to talk to my cousin. I wanted to know what really happened to her when she died. It finally started talking to me with the board name of Anna. It told me things only I would know about myself and others, and that's when it drew me in. I would come home after work and play, then I started coming home on my lunch hour. It totally consumed me for about 3 weeks, and then it showed its evil side.
<br><br>
The day before Halloween I was told by the board that it was going to posess me. I asked how it would do that, and the board said it would f... me in my sleep. I was concerned because it also said that Halloween was its Holiday, and it was the next day!! I put the board away and was going to go to sleep. I seemed to drift off as soon as I layed down and I then felt the covers gently sliding down off of me. The room felt heavy, and my arms started to float in the air. I became really scared and started asking if someone was in the room to wave my right arm while floating...it started going up and down really fast. I got up and ran out my bedroom to find a friend who fell asleep on the couch standing on the couch sceaming beacuse the board that was left under the couch was shaking around and making noises. My Chow was barking and trying to break through the patio door. I was terrified at this point. We grabbed the boards took them outside and put them in the grill and set them on fire. I jumped in my car heading for my mom's house, and drove the ten miles with the interior light on. I was beating on my mom's door at 2:00 am Halloween telling her to get me a preacher. She could tell I was extremly upset and tried to listen to me. I was now like a zombie, but was speaking weird things and drawing and writing things. The figure 8 was the main thing I was drawing and then words. She called for her friend to come over which I wrote she was a bum. That didn't go over well. Mom's friend decided to call her friend that was an avid church memember (Catholic), which then I wrote that was fine, Catholic were my people. I just keep writing and writing and speaking in this weird voice. I was afraid to go to sleep, so I stayed awake until the clairvoyant opened and we went to talk to her.
<br><br>
She looked at me and said I had done something that was larger than me and I needed to got see the Catholic Priest and have him burn a white candle. We went to the Catholic Church the Priest ran from me and would not see me. I was finally taken to a Retired Baptist Preacher and we didn't tell him what had happened, he just thought I needed saving. He had me to repeat after him and I got up and went to the bathroom. I saw God for myself and I felt the evil spirit leaving...the weight off of me was huge and it just simply went away. I didn't tell the sweet Preacher where I worked, but for some strange reason he knew. I was bending down behind the display the next day, and he came by and patted me on the shoulder and asked how I was. He had a twinkle in his eye that I will never forget, like he knew what really happened just never said a word. He passed away a few years later, he was a true messenger of God.
<br><br>
I still had nightmares, or I think they were just nightmares.I would be a sleep and then attacked, slung around in my bed. I could feel my legs being pried apart. I would try to scream but I couldn't. I would wake up and try to scream and still could not get a word out. I would call for a frined in the next room and they couldn't hear me, even though I could see them. This abuse didn't stop until I met and married my angel, and its been 19 years now that I have been free of all of it. These boards are not toys and should be removed from the shelves. I just wonder how many people have let these evil spirits control their lives and ended up losing thier life. These boards are very dangerous to your soul, but I can say that it made a complete believer that there are evil spirits and one higher being spirit and he controls it all. I saw the awesome spirit and its here when you need it. You can call it what you will God, Great Spirit, but its here for you and its stronger than anything on this earth and beyond. SO BELIEVE, ITS SO WORTH IT...
