		<div class="content">Wow, been a while since I have visited my little blog.  Busy season around the old homestead.  Let's see, what has been happening.  <br />RAIN, LOTS OF FUCKIN' RAIN!!!<br />It is all mommy's mommy fault.  Oh yeah, I know, it is planting season and she was being Mrs. Greenthumb and it was getting a little dry.  So the whiner said she hoped it would rain and what did we get?  A damned monsoon season!!  I think I am growing webs between my toes.  Mud is everywhere.  Even the plants and ducks are complaining.  I cannot help but wonder, she is always saying that if you sacrifice to the dark lord you will get what you ask for....and the squirrel population does seem to be down.<br /><br />Just kidding, we are not Satanists or members of any pagan, well come to think of it, much of any kind of religion (not that there is anything wrong with that, just not our choice) but I am starting to wonder what caused all this rain!!!<br /><br />If the rain wasn't bad enough the family was having a fence built.  The guy was going to drive in the posts but ended up hand digging because it was too WET!  The job was to have taken 3-5 days and ended up taking about 3 weeks because of the WET!  All sorts of trucks and people and machinery around.  Did I get to investigate though?  Hell no, every time I did manage to travel outdoors pain-in-the-ass mommy would watch me to make sure I did not get too close to anything.  I just wanted to be Tractor Queen for a minute, I could have gotten up on that seat and sat there and preened if only I had a couple more minutes of freedom.  Sometimes life just sucks.<br /><br />More joy, Newt, the mama cat got spayed last year.  This spring she committed suicide by crossing the road.  Fool!!!  Then Bobb the Tomcat went on walk-about or whore-about and was gone leaving only one spayed outside cat with a wonderful (sarcasm doesn't work well on email) name of Lil' Fluff.  She was named after her father, the neighbor's big tom, Big Fluff, no wonder he decided to take the walk and die the same way as his consort, Newt.  So Lil' Fluff was an orphan and very lonely.  So mommy and her mommy get this bright idea to get....KITTENS.  Rotten little, trash everything, busy, run around, climb tree, hiss at me (how dare they) kittens.  3 little females.  Thelma, Louise and Skinny Cat.  Don't ya just love the names.  Mommy and her mommy are still thinking of a name for the not so cute skinny one but for now Ugly or Skinny will have to do.  This doesn't please me at all, three more inferior outside invaders.  There mama must have been a tramp, I heard she didn't know who the father was...dreadful.  Well, guess everyone cannot be an aristocrat like me.<br /><br />Of course the hell hounds love the kittens.  Well, not exactly, the first night Oscar tried to chew one up (and got his ass chewed out) and Max almost died trying to smell three active butts and eat their bodily waste as they produced it.  Sammie was the most sensible, he just barked, howled and in general looked shocked.  Things have settled down some although those kittens do seem to worry the dogs...heheheheheheee, maybe those kittens serve a purpose.  Maybe the dogs will get stressed and go bald and then have to go to the vet.  They hate the vet so that would make me one content puss.<br /><br />I do not like the wet but love the warm weather.  I get pretty upset if mommy spends what I consider to be too much time with that boyfriend Mike when she should be home catering to my every whim.  Right now I have loved going outside to socialize with the lesser beings and even to partake in some of their "simple" pleasures such as chasing bugs and birds.  Mommy needs to keep her ass at home in my opinion.  She keeps saying she needs to get our room in order and her mommy keeps nodding yes.  I think if the window people call and set up an appointment that words could fly.  Stay tuned for more on that story.  But anyway, I am blogging because I feel totally neglected tonight.  I am perturbed.<br /><br />This was interesting.  Mommy's mommy was watering her hanging basket (at the time she only had one).  She hauls herself up on a chair and starts to lift it down to water since she and mommy's daddy had been fighting over her "overwatering" the plant.  She would water it and all the water seemed to just run right through and get all over the porch which always caused an argument, a nice loud one.  Anyway, she wanted to see what the problem was, not enough dirt, something wrong...whatever.  She lifted the pot off the hook and something was in her face screeching and flapping.  Mamma bird had decided to hollow out the center of the plant and put a nice big nest in there and did not take kindly to being disturbed.  Mommy's mommy was really pissed and called mommy's daddy outside to show him why all the water had been running through, that she knew she wasn't overwatering and that he could get the nest and all 5 eggs out and put it somewhere.  I think he threw it over the fence but do not want to upset any true-blue animal lovers and since I am not sure will just say it placed it in the wild for mama bird to claim.  Mommy's mommy did quite an impression of the "Attack of the Wacked Out Bird" which made lots of people laugh.  She was not as amuzed.  Of course, she and birds have had lots of problems.  Birds enjoy pooping on her.  She has been pooped on outside at work, in the yard, on the swing under the maple tree, just all sorts of places.  The worst was the attack of Shitzilla.  Walking in the yard with several other people this hawk-bird-thing comes flying over and lets loose with a major load of crap, right on mommy's mommy.  That happened years ago and she still remembers it like yesterday.  Yes, there are monsters and Shitzilla is one.<br /><br />Time to stop for now.  Beth the Brutal visited for her weekly free meal and should be calling to let mommy's mommy know she made it home safely.  Mommy's mommy is a worry wart and if her kids are 50 and she is 100 she will still have them call her.  She can be quite upset and make lives living hell if left to worry. I do so love to listen to phone calls and try to distract her.  Besides, mommy might come home soon.  I hope, I miss her.<br /><br />More adventures, perhaps stories of bald weiner dogs if those intruding kittens do something worthwhile, like keep worrying the dogs.  <br /><br />love to all, Ratty, Supreme Ruler of the Homestead.</div><br>
