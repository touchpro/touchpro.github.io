On May 27, 2006 I received an e-mail from Yesimapollock about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I would like to tell a story about my experience with a Ouija when I was 18 (I am now 24).
<br><br>
I have always had an Ouija board as long as I can remember. I had recieved my first one when I was 12, and a series of 2 or 3 more since then.
<br><br>
I've seen so many occult movies, and thought that I was going to be possessed by a demon. So from early on I knew never to play with the board by myself. My best friend and I used to play with the thing every night. Asking silly questions like: who likes me? Who am I going to marry? Will so and so kiss me? The normal stuff your hormonal adolescent brain thinks of when you're in your early teens. It was fun, but it eventually had gotten very boring, so I put away the board away for good when I was about 16.
<br><br>
I say I put it away for good like I could actually possibly do that. I managed to keep it in my closest for 2 years until I moved into my first apartment. While moving my stuff from one house to the next, I came across the board again. I really didn't think too much of it and packed it away in my closest of the new place.
<br><br>
I was out on my porch the one day when my neighbor decided to be friendly and introduce herself. We got to talking and she joked about my rent being cheap. I mean yeah, my rent was really really really really cheap (A one bedroom, full living room and kitchen with a decent size bath for only $270 a month, and included EVERYTHING). I asked her how she knew that and she told me about the previous tenant. According to the woman, the man who used to live there was a very elderly man. He had lived in the apartment for over 30 years. Well, earlier that year (I moved there in August) he had died in the apartment. He was in the apartment dead for over a week before someone found him.
<br><br>
<i>******A little background before I continue*******</i>
<br>
The apartment was originally owned by an elderly woman who lived in the front apartment. My apartment was the rear one. And from what I know, no one lived in the middle apartment. The elderly woman who owned the apartment building passed away in her residence 2 years prior. She left the building to her son. He lives in Jersey (I'm from Pennsylvania). He didn't want to take care of the place and just really wanted someone in there during the winter so he didn't have to come up to run the water so the pipes didn't bust...Sorry to bore you with this part, I just like being precise.
<br><i>*********************</i>
<br><br>
I finished talking to the woman and walked into my apartment. I suddenly got the chills. My landlord told me that all the furniture was left there by the previous tenant. Gross...Now I'm thinking that this elderly man died on the living room couch or chair. I decided that I was going to try to contact this man.  At least to find out where he died so I can deodorize the place. I got out my Ouija board, and all that kept going through my head was demonic possession...Oh well, we're talking about an elderly man that died of old age.
<br><br>
I pull out my Ouija board, lit some candles, and put on my crucifix (always good to have a little god on your side when you're messing around with the unknown).
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: nothing<br>
<br>
Me: Is there anyone there who would like to talk?<br>
Board: nothing<br>
<br>
At this point I thought that ok, maybe this doesn't work by yourself.  OK, one more shot...
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there at ALL?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(WooHoo)
<br><br>
Me: Are you friend or foe?<br>
Board: Friend<br>
<br>
Me: Hi my name is ____. Can I have your name please?<br>
Board: Walter<br>
<br>
Me: Walter, we're you the man living in my house?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Darn it... Dead end...OK, lets see...
<br><br>
Me: Do you know the name of the man that used to live here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is his name?<br>
Board: Henry<br>
<br>
Me: Is his presence still here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Does he mean me any harm?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you, Walter. Good-Bye<br>
Board: Good-bye<br>
<br>
That was good enough for me. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't in a place where I was unwelcome. I lived there for a total of 8 months. A lot of strange events happened in my house. I'm notorius for leaving candles lit. Yet in the morning they would all be out. The smell of old spice (I know that smell my heart, my dad ALWAYS wears it) would linger through the house. Windows that were open when leaving my house for work would be closed when I got home. My front door was NEVER locked, and yet every once in a while they would be locked when I woke up. I never thought of this as a threat or anything. I just think he didn't realize he had died and continued to do everything he did when he was alive.
