On June 22, 2005 I received an e-mail from Mike J. about a creepy ouija board experience his parents had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;In 1978, my mom was a nurse in a retirement center where she and her coworkers had recently lost a patient.  One of the other nurses brought up the topic of how cool it would be to speak with the lady who had passed away
recently using an ouija board.  Another nurse Georgia stated that the ouija board was kid's play and in the Philippines (where she was from) they played with &quot;the spirit in the glass.&quot;
<br><br>
The &quot;girls&quot; (my mom, other nurses, and Georgia) created a board, burned a candle and allowed the smoke from the candle to fill a glass that was placed on the board.  So the game begins...while playing with the board and asking numerous questions, my dad arrived to pick my mom up.  He met the ladies in the nurses lounge and inquired what they were doing.  At that point, Georgia explained the game and my dad joined in.  Being the skeptic, my dad
questioned the board with quot;guy&quot; questions like his new son's name, his license plate number, and type of vehicle he drove.  Being the room was filled with women (not trying to stereotype) he knew none of the ladies
would know the last two answers.  The board correctly answered all his questions.
<br><br>
My mom (being the intrepid woman she is) asked the board, &quot;Who is really in the glass?&quot;  The board spelled out the name Satan.  Again, being my mom, she asked, &quot;Why did you get kicked out of the kingdom of Heaven?&quot;  The board quickly spelled out, &quot;None of your business B*tch.&quot;  At that point, my dad said, it's not happy so it's time we left.  Mom did not want to go, the spirit in the glass pissed her off, so she soon said, &quot;I am not scared of you!  You are beneath me and nothing you can do can harm me.&quot;  The board started spinning around quickly and stopped working.  That was the final straw for my dad, he collected my pissed off mom and they left.
<br><br>
My parents divorced in 1988, 10 years after I was born, and Mom and I moved to Texas (now in Missouri).  Mom told me this story when I was about 14 years old after watching a movie about ouija boards.  She recalled the account
vividly.  As most teens at my age then, disbelieved her thinking she was trying to scare me from using a board.
<br><br>
When I was 22, my dad called me and left a voicemail message from Vegas that said, &quot;Michael I know what you've been up too, I've used the 'Spirit in the Glass' so I know a lot.&quot;  He was just joking about using the spirit in the glass, however when I called him back, he repeated the encounter verbatim. I WAS SHOCKED!  My mom was not pulling my leg, the encounter was true and my dad 1000 miles away and 22 years later repeated what she said.
<br><br>
This is the reason I am leery about using any board.  I do not want to contact the wrong people, nor be subject to having a spirit roam freely in my apartment to do any harm to me or any future tenants.  When I moved into my apartment after college, I prayed for Christ's protection to remove any evil spirits or beings in the dwelling.  I commanded the departure of anything that would do me harm in the name of Jesus!
<br><br>
I have lived here for 3.5 years and have had a blessed experience.  I pray your readers who experiment with the ouija find peace in Christ and if they ever experience a scary or demonic situation, ask them to say the name Jesus.  There is power in his name and he can and will remove all evil things from his presence.  Command the evil to depart immediately and never return for that the persons in the house/apartment are protected by the blood of Christ and are empowered by his armor of faith and holiness.&quot;
