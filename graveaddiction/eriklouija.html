On February 8, 2007 I received an e-mail from Erik Luikens about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Erik Luikens, and I live in Holland. I would like to tell you about an experience with an ouija board.
<br><br>
My friend (Johan) approached me at school and asked me if I had any plans for the weekend.  I told him that I didn't have any plans, and he told me about an ouija board he made and asked if I would like to try it out with him.  I told him that I would like that since I had no fear of spirits.  I went to his house around 23.00 (11:00 PM) and we waited until 00.00 (midnight).  I was pretty nervous...he wasn't before we started talking to someone.
<br><br>
Johan: Are there any spirits here that wish to talk to us?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Spirit: Chris<br>
<br>
Johan: Do you have a message for me?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Johan: Would you like to tell me the message?<br>
Spirit: Yes you have to be careful at shop class<br>
<br>
<i>Shop class is where we do things with metal and wood, and more of that stuff</i>
<br><br>
Johan: Thank you<br>
<br>
Erik: Do you have a message for me too?<br>
Spirit: Yes you should be careful at shop class<br>
<br>
Erik: Thank you.<br>
<br>
Johan: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Spirit: Goodbye<br>
<br>
What happened at shop class: Johan and I had a project where we needed to use an electric saw all the time.  When we started it very carefully, the saw broke and flew with high speed to the place where we usually stood when whe were using the saw.  We talked to Chris three times more times, until he didn't answer us anymore.  I think I owe the spirit a hospital visit or maybe even my life.
