On May 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Aaron about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

To cut a long story short, my mum had a brother who was lost at sea in 1975.  We always suspected murder. My mum always told me of the dangers of ouija boards, and never to use one because of a scary experience she had.  Anyway, one day I walked into my mum's room, and to my suprise she had a REAL ouija board.  I asked her why, after everything she had told me, was she doing this.  My mum said, &quot;because I need to get in contact with Tommy.&quot;  That is my uncle's name. Ever since his death, my mum has had panic attacks because she was closest to him.  By getting in contact with him, it would help her to move on, but my mum said it wasn't working with her.  Now, me and my mum have both been told that we are very psychic, my mum with the pendant and me with the board -because when I touched it, it moved like a bat out of hell.
<br><br>
We did get Tommy up and asked it questions that only he would know.  We were convinced by now that it definitely was him, so we asked him what happened on the SS Northern Star back in 1975.  He was a chef on that ship, he was only 18 when he went missing, and the board spelled out drug abuse, homosexual rape and man overboard.  So I then asked if he was drugged and raped and then chucked overboard, and the board said yes: &quot;I drowned in the water and sank to the bottom - my body is still there today.&quot; My mum asked who the murderers were, and it spelled out Ian Willkinson, John Farrel.  It zoomed out so fast I-A-N M-E-L-L-E-R, which meant that he must have been the main instigator.
<br><br>
Anyway, later that night, 28 spirits came into the room.  They were all family, and it was quite nice to experience, but we decided to call the shots for that night. I have a strong wicca belief and practice witchcraft.  On the board Tommy has always said I'm strong.
<br><br>
One other night we decided to do it, and a man named Rob Ball came up on the board.  He said he was from street, and he was in his 40's and died of cancer.  He walks the earth, refusing to cross over.  He is always with his dog, which was making my border collie dog, Patch, a bit weary. He kept asking my mum to take off her clothes, and kept asking Lee, my stepdad, to enter him in a possessive way.  When I heard this, I was like whoa - I'm getting one freaky exorcist de ja vu...noo you don't! Anyway, Tommy kept saying to do an exorcism, so I did.  According to Tommy, it was actually working.  That was a relief - we called the shots again that night.
<br><br>
After that, my mum kept it in the shed, refusing to touch it for a couple of days. One day my mum kept me home from school because I was ill, and we decided to do it again.  We asked for Tommy, and it came up saying that it was him.  We asked it questions that only Tommy would know, and they were all different.  We asked how he died, and it said he took an overdose and committed suicide by jumping overboard.  We knew this wasn't Tommy, and when we asked it further questions, it kept saying goodbye.  Then the real Tommy came up and said burn board now or I-A-N will hurt Aaron.  So me and my mum together broke the board up into little pieces, poured turps all over it, set it on fire, and watched it burn.  Even though I've been tempted, I've never touched one since.
