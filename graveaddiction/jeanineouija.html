On April 23, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jeanine Snyder about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I stumbled upon this website with a friend one day because we were looking for a ghost town to explore around the PA or OH area one evening.  I found this website to be extremely informative, so I kept reading.  I read your section about Ouija boards, as well as did some other research from other websites about them, and I became intrigued.  I wasn't sure  what would happen, but I wanted to try it.  My friends Dennis, Chris, and I went to Toys R Us and picked up the glow-in-the-dark Parker Brothers version.  We took it back to Chris's apartment.  We weren't sure what would happen, since Chris lives in an apartment above a funeral home.  We had no idea who we would come in contact with.
<br><br>
Chris and I got on first.  We lit 3 light colored candles and had a bowl of water sitting in the middle of them.  Dennis sat beside us and observed for the first time.  Chris and I placed our 2 index fingers lightly on the planchette, and circled the board 3 times with it.  I said a prayer, &quot;Dear Spirits, thank you for coming to share your time with us. We only invite spirits who are here for our highest good and any evil spirits who wish to do us harm are not welcome here.&quot; (or something along those lines.)  I was extremely nervous.  I closed my eyes and pictured myself surrounded by a white light.
<br><br>
I asked, &quot;is there anyone here who wishes to speak with us?&quot; The planchette right away moved to YES.  I asked it to give me a name.  It spelled out &quot;DAD.&quot;  My heart sank and I became really nervous.  It was my dad, who had died in July 2005 of a heroin overdose, I hadn't seen or spoken to him for five years before that.  He must have known how scared I felt, so he spelled out &quot;SORRY,&quot; probably apologizing for everything he had put my family through the last few years of his life.  I decided to ask a question that my friends didn't know the answer to, just to make sure.  None of my friends really knew my middle name, so I said &quot;If this is you daddy, can you please tell us my middle name?&quot;, and right away it spelled &quot;DARLENE.&quot;  Just to make sure one more time, I said &quot;Can you give me a nickname you used to call me when I was little?&quot; And it spelled out &quot;TERD&quot; (When we were being silly, my dad used to call me a terdball, haha!).  Then I asked him questions like, &quot;is Nunnie ever going to be happy again?&quot; to which he answered NO. (Nunnie is my grandmother, she's been extremely depressed since my dad died last year.)  Then I told him I was sorry for ignoring him for so long.  He said &quot;NO SAD,&quot; telling me not to be sad anymore.  Then the planchette moved to &quot;GOODBYE.&quot;
<br><br>
Dennis decided to take a turn and Chris moved off to the side.  We put the planchette back on the middle of the board and placed our index fingers on it.  I asked again if there was anyone who wished to speak with us.  This time it took a few moments, and it eventually moved to YES.  I asked for a name, and it started spelling out &quot;EGEGEFG.&quot;  That kind of freaked me out, but we kept going.  Dennis asked, &quot;are you one of my relatives?&quot; and it again moved to YES.  He asked, &quot;if this is a relative of mine, please say my mother's maiden name.&quot;  It again started moving to weird letters, so we decided to say goodbye.  When it went to goodbye, we took the planchette off the board.
<br><br>
Chris and Dennis switched places again.  We opened the board for the last time that night, and I asked &quot;is anyone else around who wishes to talk?&quot;  And it moved quickly again to YES.  &quot;Can you please give us a name?&quot; I asked, when the board spelled out UNCLE TOM.  It was my uncle...who died a week before my dad of a heart attack. Then it spelled out &quot;MELLON&quot;, which is the name of the company I work for, and my uncle also worked for that company his entire career.  Then it spelled out &quot;GINNY.&quot;  This really shocked me.  Ginny was a friend of my grandmother's who passed away when I was younger, I remember her though, she was a very close friend of the family.  I became less nervous by this time and I felt completely relaxed.  &quot;Can you tell me how many of my family members are here tonight?&quot; I asked, and the planchette moved to 5.  I asked, &quot;Is Mimi here too?&quot; (Mimi is what I called my grandmother.  She died in March of 2004 of a heart attack, I was extremely close to her.)  And the planchette moved to YES.  Then it proceeded to spell out &quot;PAP&quot; and &quot;C DOG.&quot;  My pap was there too!  I felt good to know that because I had never actually met my pap, he died when my mother was 2 years old.  &quot;C Dog?&quot; I asked, &quot;Are you talking about my dog, Fritz?&quot; and the planchette moved to NO.  Then it hit me.  &quot;Are you talking about Toby?&quot;  and it moved to YES!  Toby was my grandmother's dog!  We had to have him put to sleep before my grandmother moved out of her house into an apartment, because he had terrible allergies and suffered his whole life. To give you a bit of background info on Toby, he was a special dog. When my grandmother went to get a dog, she wanted a Yorkshire Terrier and we went to get him from a breeder.  I was with her that day, and I pretty much picked Toby for her.  He was the smallest one, and I couldn't stop petting him and playing with him.  I knew he was perfect.  My grandmother loved him so much.  I loved him from the moment I laid eyes on him.  And he was still there with me!  My whole family that I missed and loved so much were all there with me.  &quot;I love you and I miss you Uncle Tommy,&quot; I said, to which he replied &quot;I LOVE U&quot;.  I started crying uncontrollably, so I had to say goodnight.  Before I could, the planchette moved to the numbers 4 and 6.  46 was the age my uncle was when he died.  Then it spelled out &quot;BEAUTY&quot; which is what my grandmother used to call me.  I couldn't stop crying.  &quot;I have to say goodnight now, but I love all of you and I hope I can talk to you again soon,&quot; and the planchette moved to &quot;GOODBYE&quot;.
<br><br>
I cried hysterically, but after that, I felt nothing but peace and I was very content.  Using the Ouija board let me come in contact with people I loved so much, and I missed them terribly.  It gave me a chance to forgive my dad for what he had put my family through.  It gave me a chance to tell my uncle and grandmother how much I loved them.  I am so glad that I picked up an Ouija board.  I'm not sure how often I will use it, but I know that I will do it again.
