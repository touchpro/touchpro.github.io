On December 6, 2005 I received an e-mail from Nicole Lane about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I have a story...actually a couple stories, but all relate back to the same board.....
<br><br>
The board is from the 1940's (I believe that is what it said, it is on the shelf for display so I can't get to it right now), it was my friend's mom's board from when she was a little girl.  Back when she was younger, I believe around 12, there was a murder, and her father was the police chief at the time.  She would hear him talk with her mother about the murder and how they hadn't gotten any closer to finding the body or the person who commited the crime (it started off as a missing person report, but then later something came about to make them think murder).  Well, my friend's mom decided to get the board out with her friends and play with it.  She started asking questions about the missing girl: if she would ever be found, where she was, what happened, etc.  The board told them the girl was by the lake, and they kept on asking questions and ended up finding out that the body would be found on a Wednesday on Lake Road, down in the ditch on the side of the road.  After they found out this information, they quit playing as the board quit responding.  She told her father about this and he brushed it off and wanted the board out of the house.
<br><br>
She kept on telling him and begging him to just go look, but he would never do it.  By this point about two Wednesdays had passed.  They decided to play with the board again, and it said that in one month, on a Wednesday, they would find her...so she again told her dad who brushed it off, and again told her to stop playing with the ouija.  Well low and behold, a couple weeks later they found the girl's body out by the lake in a ditch.  Her dad came home and told her mom about it, and said he didn't know if he should tell her or not.  Well, she overheard them talking that night, so she and her friends played with the board the next day...this time asking who the murderer was and where they could find that person.  It gave them a first name and an address.  It said something  like 124 Main.  When her dad got home she told him and he wouldn't listen.  Almost another month went by with no leads in the case, and her father finally broke down and asked her what the information was again...this time they went and looked at the address given and nobody by that name lived there...he would never tell the others about where he got the information since it was foolish and nothing good came out of going to that house.
<br><br>
About another week went by with officers staking out that house and the name with still no luck.  It was the next week when another officer finally asked him where he got the info and he broke down and told the story.  They decided to go door to door on that street...and sure enough at 1124 they found the man there by that name.  They also found the girl's belongings inside.  After this the board was put away in storage and she wasn't allowed to play with it.
<br><br>
The next encounter with the board was on Halloween night in early 1990's...I remember I was in 6th grade and my friend had found the board, so we and a bunch of our friends decided to play with it.  Her mom didn't mind, but her grandma was going crazy that we were going to play with it.  That is when they told us the story.  Now at first we just laughed it all off until it said that it was my grandpa and he had a warning for us.  My friend and the daughter of the mom who owned the board were told to be careful that night because a car would follow us.  We kept asking questions and it said a white car, but we thought someone was pushing it.   We went out that night as usual, and went to a girl's house to smash the pumpkins and toilet paper the house....as we were doing it, we saw headlights and we all took off in different ways: my friend and I going one way, and everyone else another.  We ran around the block, then started laughing and looking for the other girls when we saw headlights coming up behind us slowly.  We started walking and they still stayed behind us, so we started running and the car started to speed up.  By this point we were in full sprint with nowhere to go.  We finally ran to the school through the playground, to the underpass.  It has an underpass so kids can cross the busy street without getting in traffic.  It is supposed to be locked up tight at night....
<br><br>
Anyway, we ran to that and we turned around and saw the car pull in.  Two men get out of the car and start towards the playground.  We hurried and made our way to the entrance of the underpass and ran through the gate, not thinking about it being open.  We got to the otherside and the gate was closed but not locked tight, so we were able to squeeze through.  We got out and looked across the street towards the school, and the men were running back to their car.  We ran back to her house (on a busy street) about 4 blocks away, making sure we stayed in the light and in view of other people out.  We got to her house and everyone was in there waiting.  We were screaming and crying and told her mom the story.  She grabbed the board and put it up.
<br><br>
The board was put away for about 6 months before we found it again and brought it to my slumber party.  We were playing with it, and it said that is was my grandma talking tous.  It gave information that only my friend and I would know, and we were not on the board.  Then we started talking to someone named Jefv...I don't know if it was misspelled and was supposed to be Jeff or what, but either way we talked all night long.  The next morning we played with it again and were given more names and more background information.  He said that he had a daughter named Rosemary...he asked us to make sure his daughter was ok, so we were like WHAT?!  We decided to get out the phone book and we called around.  The last number we tried, we asked for Jefv and they asked who  was calling.  We just made up a name and we were told he had passed away.  So we asked for Rosemary and the woman again asked who we were and what we were calling about.  We didn't know what to say, so we made up something again...it ended up being that the woman on the phone was Rosemary and this person was her father!  Now how any of us being about 11 and 12 years old could know this information is beyond me!
<br><br>
the only thing we could think is the board was a true accounto f things that had happened...seeing as how most times we played it things came true and it gave information that only certain people would know
<br><br>
Now the board was put up until about 2 years ago....it had been played with a couple times for a few minutes before that, but not for more than 5 minutes.  Now I am 24, so for about 10-12 years the board was put away...  A friend and I decided to play with it, and it said her dog was dead....she thought it mean the one back in Nashville that she had to leave with a friend (she named her new dog the same as her old dog).  She started crying, and then we stopped playing and I told her we needed to go to her house.  She couldn't understand why until I reminded her that her new dog had the same name...just that morning she had been hit by her son's bus, but got up and ran to the porch so everyone thought the dog was ok.  Well, we get to her house and they can't find the dog until they hear her under the house...they finally get her out, and she is not doing good.
<br><br>
Her son was holding her and crying.  I just sat there, and about 5 minutes later the dog died and we buried her.  After that my friend swore off ouija boards.   She said she knew something bad would come of it (it was her first time playing it, and she was 31).  Since then it has been put up in the shelf for display with my others.
<br><br>
I almost forgot...there was one time in between that big time gap that it was played for more than 5 minutes.  I was about 19 and we played it for a little while one night when it was raining.  A guy who was playing with it had his hands get SOOOO HOT...I mean, to the touch they were like on fire!  Then a little while later we played it again, and we had a candle next to the board for light with plastic flowers around the bottom of the candle.  Now mind you, this was a tall pillar candle a good 8 inches or more away from the flowers at the bottom.  The planchette started going in a figure 8 on the board very fast, and I said we needed to stop playing with it.  Nobody else would listen and take their hands off, when all of a sudden I looked over and screamed.....the flowers were on fire!   Now obviously this could be due to anything, maybe someone had a cigarette and it touched a flower, or the flame jumped somehow, or wax was too hot and dripped on it...who knows.  But there could be a logical explanation...I don't believe there is, but who knows.  However, other than that the board was only played, as I said, a couple times in about 10 years until the one time it told us about my friend's dog.
