On April 13, 2009 I received an e-mail from Janice about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

On April 8, me (Janice) and my friend (Vanessa) were playing the ouija board in school. Its been said that our school used to be some kind of place where they did something to dead bodies, but I think that's just a myth. Anyway, my friend and I were playing and we met this very RUDE spirit named &quot;ET.&quot;  This was our conversation.
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits we can talk too?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell me your name please?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you spell it out?<br>
Board:  FU<br>
<br>
(I think she was cussing us out)<br>
<br>
Me: Can you please tell us your name again?<br>
Board: FU<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have a nickname?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell us please?<br>
Board: ET<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 23<br>
<br>
(earlier that morning, I was talking to a spirit that was 23)<br>
<br>
Me: Oh, was that you in the morning?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can we ask you some questions?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vannesa: Who do I like? You better get it right.<br>
Board: SOB<br>
<br>
Me: Did you just call my friend a son of a bitch?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Haha! Do you think she's a bitch?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vannesa: Am I a nice bitch?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who does Larissa like?<br>
Board: Tj<br>
<br>
(that is true)<br>
<br>
Me: Who does Lisa like?<br>
Board: Veto<br>
<br>
(true, even though she spelled it wrong)<br>
<br>
Me: Who do I like?<br>
Board: Ricardo<br>
<br>
(true again)<br>
<br>
Vanessa: How many kids am I going to have?<br>
Board: 3<br>
<br>
(She does want to have 3 kids)<br>
<br>
Me: How about me?<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
(I do want a big family)<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Am I going to break up with my girlfriend?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vannesa: When?<br>
Board: Sep 3 2009<br>
<br>
Vannesa: How?<br>
Board: Cheat<br>
<br>
Vannesa: Am I going to cheat on her?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Vannesa: Oh! Is it with Monique?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Who am I going to go with next?<br>
Board: Ernie<br>
<br>
(I liked him)<br>
<br>
Me: Oh! When?<br>
Board: Dont know<br>
<br>
Me: Were you a bitch when you were alive?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Were you a nice one?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Vanessa: Did you have any tattoos?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(bell rings)<br>
<br>
Me: Shit! The bell rang, we have to go. Bye!<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Later that day we talked again, but that is a whole other conversation.  She was the rudest spirit we have talked to. She was cussing us out, but she was cool. Oh, and later that day she said she was an evil spirit.
