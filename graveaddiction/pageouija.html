On July 10, 2005 I received an e-mail from Page Chamberlain from Momence, Illinois about her very interesting ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I have played with the ouija board many times and it was usually with my friend, Britt. Well, one night I had my friend Loren over and she wanted to play with it. We were talking to the two spirits who claimed they are living in my house because we are unhappy. Their names are Abe, he's 15, died in a car accident with his dad. And June, she's 18, she died of cancer. So anyways, Loren and I were talking to Abe because June said that she didn't like Loren because she couldn't pick between two boys (I thought it was pretty funny). So we talked to Abe. Abe is so cool to talk to. He was saying how he thought Loren was hot and pretty. Haha. And how much fun we are. Then we had to go eat dinner, so we just left the board out with tht planchette on top of it (which was a bad thing to do). We came back and we asked if there was anyone in the room and it said yes. We asked if it was Abe or June and it said no. I was getting a little freaked because I've always talked to June and Abe. I asked what it's name was and it said Todd. I asked how old he was and he said 21. I asked if he was going to hurt us and he said yes. We were so scared that we put the board away and left the room.
<br><br> 
Weeks later, Britt stays the night and we try to contact Abe. Only it wasn't him. It was that Todd guy. I asked if he was following me and he said yes. He said that he wanted to kill me. We put the board away for the night. 
<br><br> 
On my birthday, August 22, Britt was over and we took the board out. Todd was there. I asked &quot;why do you want to kill me?&quot; and he said &quot;you disturbed Abe&quot;. Britt and I were so confused. I asked &quot;how do you know Abe?&quot; and he said &quot;car accident&quot;. We just sat there and looked at each other in confusion. And it hit me...Abe died in an accident so I asked &quot;Were you in the other car that hit Abe's car in the accident?&quot; and he said &quot;yes&quot;. We couldn't believe it!! I asked &quot;is there anything I can do so you won't be mad at me anymore?&quot; and he said &quot;bring Abe to the light&quot;. We had no idea what he meant. I asked&quot; how do we do that?&quot; and he said &quot;seance&quot;. I said &quot;what do we say?&quot; and he said &quot;she knows&quot;. I looked at Britt and remembered that she had done a seance in a graveyard before, and that she kinda knew what to do. I asked &quot;so Abe is in hell and you want us to take him to heaven?&quot; and he said &quot;yes&quot;. I asked &quot;will you be here after we do the seance to see if it worked?&quot; and he said &quot;of course&quot;
<br><br> 
Britt and I put the board away and we put the candle that was lit in between us. We held hands and Britt said this little &quot;chant&quot;. Then she said stuff about &quot;make sure Abe gets to the light safely, and that we wish him there&quot;. We just sat there in silence for a little bit and I asked &quot;did it work?&quot;, and she said &quot;I don't know&quot;. Then she asked &quot;please show us a sign that Abe got to the light safely&quot;. Britt then kinda jumped and said that someone grabbed her shoulder and that it was really cold. 
<br><br>  
We took the board back out and we asked for Todd and he was there. I asked &quot;did it work?&quot; and he said &quot;yes thank you so much&quot;. I asked &quot;who grabbed Britt's shoulder?&quot; and he said &quot;that was Abe saying thank you&quot;. It was so cool! I then asked &quot;are you still mad at me?&quot; and he said &quot;nope&quot;. I asked &quot;are you our spirit guide?&quot; and he said &quot;yes, i am&quot;. We were so excited.
<br><br>  
We talked to Todd from then on all the time. He is so funny (he says that he is a very good looking guy). haha. we haven't seen him though. We haven't talked to him for a while though. We asked him if he was happy and he said no and that he still feels guilty for what happened. Britt and I thought and then said &quot;well, maybe if you forget your guilt, you'll make it to the light too&quot;.  I said &quot;just make sure that we know that you did&quot;. Then Britt said &quot;:touch my shoulder so I know if you did&quot;. He said okay. Like a month later, Britt was awakened by a cold grip on her shoulder. We are thinking that it was Todd, because since then, we haven't talked to him.
<br><br>  
Todd told us his last name, that the car accident made the front page news, and what day it was. But with my luck, I couldn't go dig up the newspaper because our newspaper didn't go back that far, so it must have been a different company (which sucks). But we just hope that wherever he is, he's doing good and that he's okay.&quot;
