On March 9, 2009 I received an e-mail from Erin Renee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I wrote once before on this website. I wrote about the poltergeist choking, but I thought I would add to my story.
<br><br>
Well, nothing serious has happened since I wrote my other story, but little things have happened. One morning I was getting ready for school, and I was ready really early so I decided to lay down until I had to leave in like 30 minutes. I was laying down on my bed in my room. I was half asleep, when all of a sudden I got the chills really bad, and I felt really, really weird.  Someone then whispered my name in my ear, and I felt like I couldn't move for a second. My heart started beating really, really hard, and they whispered my name two more times.  I finally shot up and looked around my room. There was no one there, and I swear to you that I heard them right in my ear. It scared the crap out of me.
<br><br>
Also, I was laying down another time.  I had my bed in the middle of my room, and all of a sudden I felt the bed shake a little.  I didn't really pay attention to it. Then the creepiest shit ever happened...my covers started to like slide off the end of my bed. Like someone was pulling it, but it wasn't so fast...it was slow, but I grabbed the blanket.  I felt the pressure of it pulling on it. I asked it to stop, and I pulled the covers towards me again. It didn't pull again. I was freaked out.
<br><br>
Sometimes I will be walking down my hall, and in the corner of my eye I will see someone standing in my bathroom.  I back up and look into the bathroom, and no one will be there. I also hear tapping coming from behind the mirror in my room like all the time, and I will hear an almost growling sound in a way, but more like a person growling from behind me sometimes. When I light candles in my room, I get a weird vibe in my whole house. I still haven't been able to sleep with all my lights off. I'm so scared that its going to hurt me, whatever it is. But I try not to let it get to me so much. Weird things just won't stop happening since I used the ouija board.
