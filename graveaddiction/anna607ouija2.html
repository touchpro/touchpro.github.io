On June 16, 2007 I received an e-mail from Anna about another interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My friends and I have been into the Ouija board lately. We've made boards and we've bought them, and both seem to work equally fine. So I figured I'd share a few stories from our recent Ouija sessions.
<br><br>
Ellie and I were alone in her room talking to the Ouija. We had her iPod on shuffle, playing on speakers quietly. The first song to play was American Nightmare by the Misfits. When we talked to spirits, we told them that they could control the shuffle of the songs to play songs that they like, and they said that they would.
<br><br>
A little later, while we Ouija'd, Ellie and I would play with the candle we had lit, running out fingers through the flame and stuff. Instantly the song playing ended and the next song was called Fire, though I can't remember who it was by. The next song was also fire-themed. I think it was Ring of Fire...not positive.
<br><br>
Later another spirit started talking to us. We didn't get it's name, but we asked if it had anything it wanted to tell us.
<br><br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What would you like to tell us?<br>
Board: Gun<br>
<br>
Us: What about a gun?<br>
Board: Grab<br>
<br>
Us: You want us to grab a gun?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Goodbye!!<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
A Sublime song was playing on Ellie's iPod. The next thing we heard in the song: &quot;Running down the road with a pistol in your hand.&quot; Coincidence?
<br><br>
Whenever we run into an evil spirit, we instantly say goodbye. And we always ask to see if the spirit is good or evil. Nothing bad has ever happened.
<br><br>
The next morning we played again. My dad was coming to pick me up soon. I asked the board what time it would be when my dad got here, and what would my would watch say. And it said 1-2-9. Later, the instant I saw my dad drive up, I checked my watch and it was 1:29.
