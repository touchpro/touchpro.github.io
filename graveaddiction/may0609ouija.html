On June 21, 2009 I received an e-mail from May about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have a few stories, but they are all from the same day.
<br><br>
First - my friend and I were at her house. I asked the board a question in my head, so she couldn't fake move the board. I asked in my head, &quot;Who loves me?&quot; It said, &quot;God loves you.&quot; This is when I first figured out that I knew the board worked, because there was no way she could answer it.
<br><br>
Second - we were in a friend's room, and we asked if spirits were there.  It said, &quot;Yeah, watch out&quot; really fast.  We were like, &quot;For who?&quot; and it said me. It was weird because it was moving so fast, like I've never seen before.
<br><br>
Last - we were in my room talking to two nice spirits. They confirmed what I thought - there were ghosts in the house. It scares me, but they are nice to me so it's all good. They made a noise, and I asked if it was them.  They said yes, and I just asked to please stop because they were scaring me - its nothing against them, I like them.  I'm just scared.  And it said, &quot;okay, sorry.&quot;
<br><br>
I haven't used it since then, and i don't plan on it...just because I don't want to risk talking to a bad spirit.
<br><br>
Don't use ouija boards - it's not worth the risk.  I still have weird feelings all the time.
