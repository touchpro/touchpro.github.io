On January 6, 2009 I received an e-mail from Rebecca about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Sunday afternoon at around 1:30 PM, my friends Brandi, Karen, and myself decided to try the Ouija Board for our first time. We turned off all the lights and shut the basement door. Now, Karen is slightly afraid of the dark, so when we started actually getting a message she flipped out at random times.
<br><br>
Anyways...4 spirits came through.
<br><br>
Me: Is there a spirit here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a boy?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: 6<br>
<br>
Brandi: When did you die?<br>
Board: 1496<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Eve<br>
<br>
Me: Why are you here?<br>
Board: Guarding<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you guarding?<br>
Board: Rebecca<br>
<br>
That's my name, and I wasn't really shocked. I wanted to keep talking to her, but my friends wanted to know who was guarding them.  So we switched. Brandi's guardian was Destiny, and Karen's was Lynn. Destiny was 5 years old when he died, we didn't ask how. Lynn was 6 years old. After we were done there, we switched back to Eve.
<br><br>
Me: Why do I need to be protected?<br>
Board: Evil spirit<br>
<br>
(Karen ran out of the room, and decided to sit on the basement steps)<br>
<br>
Brandi: Can we speak to this evil spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Brandi: Is this the evil spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Daimien (We call him Damien for short)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you trying to hurt Eve?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Brandi: Then why did she say you were evil?<br>
Board: Broke<br>
<br>
Me: What did you break?<br>
Board: I broke her doll<br>
<br>
Brandi: Are you evil?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you playing with us?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Anyways, we talked to him for a good 15 minutes. We found out that he was her older brother. Not blood related. He was 18 years old. Eve was very upset with him, so I offered to give her my stuffed doll as a replacement.  But it got stranger and stranger once we continued our conversation.<br>
<br>
Me: Damien, who are you guarding?<br>
Board: Four corners<br>
<br>
(Now, four corners is a spot in the woods that me, Brandi, Karen, and Nick made up. Like a club. And also, we were given like elements: Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. Relating to Wicca.)
<br><br>
Brandi: What's my element?<br>
Board: Earth<br>
<br>
Brandi: What are Rebecca's and Karen's?<br>
Board: Fire and Air<br>
<br>
The fact that he knew so much about us freak me out. And I'm extremely paranoid. I don't know if this was real. I don't know if he could have been lying. And he said that he would send us a sign. Nothing bad has happened yet, but I hope it doesn't.
