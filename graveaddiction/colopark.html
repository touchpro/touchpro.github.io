Col. John Maitland of Lauder, Scotland, son of the 6th<br>Earl of Lauderdale, won wide acclaim for his feat in<br>bringing 800 Highlanders and Hessian troops by water<br>from Beaufort to Savannah in Sept. 1779, under the eyes<br>of the French fleet. The timely arrival of these<br>reinforcements enabled Gen. Prevost to defend Savannah<br>against the besieging French and American forces.<br>Maitland died at Savannah on October 26, 1779, shortly<br>after the siege was raised. The British hero was buried in<br>the vault of the Royalist Lieutenant Governor, John<br>Graham. Col. Maitland's remains were, apparently,<br>removed later to another burial place.<br>Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island, one of Washington's<br>most brilliant generals, who died on June 19, 1786, at<br>Mulberry Grove near Savannah, was also interred in the<br>Graham vault. His burial place later became the subject of<br>conjecture and remained so until 1901 when this tomb<br>was opened and his remains identified. Gen. Greene's<br>ashes now repose beneath his monument in Johnson Square.<br>"

During<br>the Revolutionary War Clay rendered efficient and<br>faithful service to the American cause as deputy<br>paymaster general of the Continental Army for the<br>Southern Department. His career in the Revolution<br>was distinguished by &quot;Virtue & fortitude,&quot; said General<br>James Jackson, who also paid high tribute to Clay's<br>wife Ann (whose remains also lie here) for her<br>beneficent care of the American wounded after the<br>Battle of Camden.<br>In the years following the Revolution Joseph Clay held<br>several positions of importance, including state<br>treasurer and judge of the inferior court. He was one<br>of the first trustees for the state college that later<br>became the University of Georgia. He died Dec. 15,<br>1804.

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana">Colonial Park Cemetery is located at the intersection of Oglethorpe Avenue and Abercorn Street in Savannah, Georgia (Chatham County).  The coordinates are 32&deg; 4' 31&quot; N, 81&deg; 5' 22&quot; W.
<br><br>
Colonial Park Cemetery is also known as the Old Cemetery and The Old Brick Cemetery. It was founded in 1750, making it the second oldest cemetery in the city. It is no longer active; it was closed for new burials in 1853. In 1896 it was reopened by the city as a park. The cemetery used to cover more land than it currently does.  In fact, there are over 10,000 burials at the cemetery.  However, only 600 gravestones remain today.  Many famous citizens and war heroes are buried there.
<br><br>
Many people believe that Colonial Park Cemetery is haunted.  Perhaps it's because many of the graves were destroyed and built over?  Or maybe it's the mass graves at the back of the cemetery where victims of the Yellow Fever outbreak are buried?  The most common haunting people experience is that of a ghostly couple.  Both of these ghosts are decapitated, and missing their arms from the elbow down.  Other apparitions are sometimes seen as well.
<br><br>
I received the following e-mail from Bethany K. in December 2009 regarding this cemetery:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I had the wonderful opportunity to go to the Colonial Park Cemetery recently, and I noticed something about one of the graves. I also have a picture of it, and I wanted to ask if anyone else had noticed what appears to be the outline of a face on the tomb in the picture titled &quot;Tombs under tree.&quot; I don't know if it's coincidence, but I noticed as soon as I looked at it.</i></blockquote>
