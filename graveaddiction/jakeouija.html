On November 25, 2004 I received an e-mail from Jake Mantei about a scary experience his mother had with an ouija year many years ago:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Back in the day when my mom was young, she and some her friends would have sleepovers and play with the ouija board. In the past they had never had any bad times with the board and never met anyone who had had a bad time so the thought nothing of the board. But this night was different. They were asking silly questions about boys and who likes who. And I guess the spirit they were talking to got angry. My mom and her friend were sitting knee to knee and asked a question. But no answer. They asked again and still no answer. They asked again and all of a sudden my mom's friend lifted of the ground and flew backwards in mid air. Once my mom and who ever else was there checked her out they noticed something more. My mom's friend had fresh bite marks on her fingers, arms, and neck. (No, nothing that would have been inflicted from flying).  After they picked her up she seemed ok. No broken bones or anything. But she never did use an ouija board again.&quot;
