On October 27, 2004 I received an e-mail from Heather.  She shared a few of her interesting ouija board experiences with me to post on the site.  This story is about a few discussions she and her friends Kelly, Brittney, Brittany, and Tamara had with a few spirits on October 26, 2004:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Kelly, Brittney, Brittany, Tamara, and I (Heather) all decided to get a board.  It took a lot of meditation to get it started, but when it started it didn't want to stop. We played for 4 hours. We probably talked to 10 different spirits, and we were having such a great time doing so that we really didn't want to quit. Until a man who had passed in 1747 came through. He said he didn't remember his name or his age but told us that he died of old age. Then he told us he was a monk. When we asked if he had any questions he asked &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;  Kelly started to say that we had never done this together before but he cut her off and said &quot;NO.&quot; Then I asked him &quot;Should we stop&quot;,  and the planchette raced to yes and quickly said goodbye. Needless to say we were done... for the night anyway!&quot;
