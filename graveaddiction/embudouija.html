On June 1, 2006 I received an e-mail from Emily about an interesting ouija board experience she had:
<br><br><br>

The weekend before my 13th birthday, I had a sleepover. All of my closest friends were there: Megan, JessA, JessR, Becah, and Hayley.
<br><br>
We started playing the Oujia board (which I have no idea where it came from, I think my older brother got it for his birthday whe he turned 15 or 16 long time ago).  We played it in my basement, and since it was JessA and Megan's first time, they were a little scared but I told them that it was just a game and nothing REALLY bad is going to happen unless we ask it a really nasty question.  So we were playing it for awile and I felt like someone was watching me.   I kept looking around to make sure there was nothing there. Then everybody started freaking out...after I was looking around and stuff,  JessA was like OMG LOOK AT THE TV!! And we all freaked out and I called my mom down and she turned on the light.
<br><br>
Later we tryed it, and we just asked it questions about our future and what the fates have in store for us and crap.  But we were bored because it wasn't really working (I think it was because we were really tired) so we watched a movie and played truth or dare and went to sleep.
<br><br>
The next morning, we tried it again. This time we played it right and we were FULLY awake. I asked it if it was a nice spirit and it said yes. We asked him how old he was and he said 13. Then Megan asked how he died and he said he was killed by his dad. Becah asked where he lived and he said somewhere in Michigan...WE LIVE IN MICHIGAN!
<br><br>
We just asked him more questions and he seemed VERY nice. We asked him if he thinks one of us is cute and he said M-E-G-A-N. Then he said, &quot;Let Megan lay...&quot;, but Hayley cut him off and just guessed what he was going to say and said, &quot;Let Megan lay down?&quot;  He went to YES. So she did and she said she felt a REALLY cold spot by her and felt him touch her (in some unusal spots).
<br><br>
Later, after JessA went home, we all went to the park.  Before we left the house, we asked him if he wanted to come with us and he said YES.  So on our way there, Becah just said Samual (that was his name) hold my hand, and she felt like the numb feel you feel after some one lets go of your hand from holding for so long....it kind of feels like they're still holding your hand, thats what she felt. Then she told him to let go and she could tell because she said she didn't feel it anymore.
<br><br>
I have no idea if we were all imagineing this or if the NICE spirits sometimes will follow you after you leave and don't say goodbye.  But we ALL think it's real, and think he is our guardian angel now.
