On July 19, 2009 I received an e-mail from Shell about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Shell.  When I was 15 me and my then boyfriend, whose name was Lloyd, were very curious about the ouija board and how it works.  So being young and stupid, we made a ouija board out of paper.  I really did not want to play with it, being just me and Lloyd, so I rang a few of my girlfriends up. Once the girls rocked up, Izzy and Rachel did not want to do it as they didn't want to muck around and play with the spiritual world.  Which was fair enough, but Jess was still keen on playing, so it was me, Lloyd, and Jess at first.  We sat in the massive room downstairs at my house. But keep in mind our names: JESS, MICHELLE, and LLOYD. Here's how it went:
<br><br>
Shell: Are there any spirits in the room?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Shell: Do you have a message for any of us?<br>
Board: Yes. MICHELLE<br>
(That's my real name, I only get called that when I'm in major trouble, so I sorta knew I was in trouble after the board had said my name)<br>
<br>
Shell: Yes?<br>
Board: Get out!<br>
<br>
Shell: Why? I live here!<br>
Board: I lived here before you, I watched you last night.<br>
<br>
(The night before, Lloyd stayed over and we fell asleep in that room)<br>
<br>
Shell: Ok. So what is your name?<br>
Board: Jess<br>
<br>
Shell: Ok Jess, so when did you live here?<br>
Board: 100 years ago<br>
<br>
Shell: In THIS house? Or??<br>
Board: No the first house that was on this land.<br>
<br>
Shell: Are you bad?<br>
Board: To you, yes<br>
<br>
Shell: Do you have a message for anyone else?<br>
Board: Lloyd, I love you.<br>
<br>
Shell: (me being my overprotective 15 year old self) You don't even know him, Jess.  And besides, he is MY boyfriend.<br>
Board: GET OUT<br>
<br>
Lloyd: I love Michelle, not you.<br>
Board: NO YOU LOVE ME NOT HER<br>
<br>
Jess: You didn't mind Lloyd and Shell last night? Did it up.......<br>
<br>
I promise to GOD the next thing I am about to tell you is true. Jess was in mid-sentence, about to ask a question, while I sat there staring out the window. Lloyd was sitting down cross legged staring at me, and suddenly you hear Lloyd going WHAT THE FUCK!!! I look away from the window and look at Lloyd...my jaw dropped, and suddenly I started screaming. Lloyd had been picked up by his torso, arms up in the air, and thrown about 3 feet into the air and back down. Lloyd wasn't playing around, he couldn't have done that himself as his legs were crossed and his arms were flung up in the air and he has nooooo balance at all.  Anyway, Lloyd blacked out.  Luckily he landed on some blankets. Next thing I remember was my friend Jess going WOAHH!!! As if something had pushed her aside.  I had laid in a fetal postion just before Jess had that incident. The spirit was trying to leave the room - she had thrown Lloyd out of the way, pushed Jess aside, and then it was  my turn...as I was the one she hated the most, and since I just laid there and was closest to the door, I was in her way.  She just kicked me out of the way in my stomach. It was the weirdest sensation. It's so hard to explain - it was as if a massive numbing energy went through me. We couldn't see her when all this had happened, but we knew it was her. I walked out of the room thinking this shit's fucked. But Spirit Jess was hiding behind the door.  I knew this because everytime I walked past there, I felt the same numbing energy sensation.  I got really scared, so I started crying.  Then Izzy came out of the room, asking, &quot;her name is Jess, isn't it?&quot; I was like, yes how'd you know (she was upstairs at the time this was happening, as she wanted to stay as far away as possible as she could.  Same as Rachel, although she had stayed upstairs).
<br><br>
Izzy said she had a weird feeling that her name was Jess. My friend Jess had been with me from when I walked out of the room after being kicked. We suddenly forgot about Lloyd, and we ran back in the room and took him into the other room.  Lloyd went, &quot;My chest&quot; in a weary voice.  I lifted his shirt, and I couldn't help but cry. Jess then went, &quot;No, we HAVE to speak to her.  She won't leave until we get to the bottom of it.&quot;
<br><br>
Lloyd had scratch marks under his chest going to the end of his ribs. Lloyd then explained that was where Jess (the spirit) had grabbed him, and once thrown, she scratched him once.  She had let go, leaving bloodied nail scratch marks running horizontal. Izzy then said, &quot;I will talk to her too. I will take Shell's place.&quot; So it was Izzy, Jess, and Lloyd at the time. I stayed in the spare room with Rachel as we listened.
<br><br>
We didn't get to hear anything, because the spirit told them they didn't want me to hear their conversation.  So she made Izzy close the door.  15 minutes later, all three came out saying,  &quot;We let her go - that's all she wanted.  She apologizes for all this drama.&quot;
Apparently back in the day when she lived, her husband's name was Lloyd.  He was well known around the area, but he made her stay at home and locked her in the house. But since being 100 years ago, the houses around my area were made very small.  So their house was the size of the room we were talking to her in before, which sort of explained why she tried to run out of the room but couldn't.  The furthest she could only go was behind the other side of the door. But back to the story, she found out Lloyd was having an affair with a lady called Michelle, and she assumed it was me. Lloyd explained to her that he was a different Lloyd, and that I was a different Michelle, and that we had only been alive for 15 years. All she wanted was freedom, and she couldn't get it unless someone would let her go.  Which they did, but before they let her go she had one message for me. I heard this last bit as my ear was leaning on the door:
<br><br>
Jess: Do you have a message for anyone?<br>
(Board wrote something)<br>
<br>
Jess: Yes, what would you like us to pass on?<br>
(Board wrote something)<br>
<br>
Jess: Ok, we will pass that on.<br>
<br>
Lloyd: .. wtf?<br>
<br>
Then Rachel grabbed me and pushed me into the spare room, going &quot;DONT EVEN RISK IT, she'll get angry again!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
the message was"<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell Michelle, NEVER trust Lloyd, never forgive or he will do it again.&quot;<br>
<br>
On my 16th birthday I found out he cheated on me, and me being so dumb, I forgave him.  But on New Year's Eve I found out he cheated on me again with this girl at my school.  Again I forgave him ,then I found out through one of his friends that he was telling everyone we were not going out anymore and was hooking up with this other girl. As I laid in bed, I was thinking about all the things we had done together, and the incident with Jess came into my head. I remembered what she said: &quot;never forgive, or he will do it again.&quot; I knew I had to listen to her, so the next day I left it as it was. Lloyd kept going around to parties telling everyone another story, but he kept trying to get in contact with me. I took it as we weren't going out, and I didn't want to waste my time on a jerk anymore.  Besides, I had wasted two years I would never get back from a roofing prick like him.  So I never returned his calls or anything :)
<br><br>
I'm 18 now, and I always wonder how she is?
<br><br>
I spoke to her another time, but nothing really hectic happened.  She felt sorry about what she did, and she had a suprise for me.  It was that she was with my grandmother who had passed, and I was the only one in my family that didn't get to see her the month that she had passed. I was overseas at the time. I felt so blessed to be speaking to such a kind person, allowing me to speak to my grandmother. I knew it was her because she said, &quot;you haven't told anyone our secrets, have u chika?&quot; That's what she used to call me, and from her asking me that, I KNEW it was her.
<br><br>
I have this weird feeling that there is a new spirit in the house now?
<br><br>
I'm too scared to play the oujia board at mine again because of what happened before.
<br><br>
But everytime I read stories on the website, in the corner of my eye I see someone in a black cloak, or feel as if someone is behind me.  Then 5 minutes after i see them, my hands get really cold and then the room becomes freeezing.  I don't know if it's just me, though if anyone knows anything could you please let me know? :)
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Shell, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on to her.
