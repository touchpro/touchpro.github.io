Ohio thrill-seekers looking for a little haunted excitement can find a good scare at the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield. 
<br><br>
Once a working prison, the building is now a popular tourist attraction, offering daytime tours, an annual Halloween Tour and overnight ghost hunts. For $50 a person, guests have access to the building from 8 p.m. until dawn.
<br><br>
Completed in 1896, the reformatory was home to over 154,000 inmates and employed thousands in its 94 years in operation.
<br><br>
Prisoners came and went. Some transferred prisons or obtained parole, but some never left. There are 215 people buried under numbered markers in a graveyard just outside the prison fence. 
<br><br>
According to people who have attended one of the ghost hunts, the spirits of those buried at the prison still haunt the halls and cells of the prison.
<br><br>
Many visitors to the grounds have reported hearing a man and a woman whispering in the warden's administration wing. Some believe these voices to be those of one of the prison's wardens and his wife. 
<br><br>
Rebecca Shott has paid many visits to the Ohio State Reformatory and she has written detailed accounts of her visits on the <a href="http://www.miparahaunt.com/" target="_blank">ParaHaunt</a> Web site. 
<br><br>
&quot;I am a firm believer that there are many unfortunate spirits who refer to the tremendous stone structure as their humble abode,&quot; she said.
<br><br>
Shott said she believes the photographs, video and recordings she has taken at the reformatory back her up.
<br><br>
Orbs and anomalies appear on photographs, strange lights and noises were caught on video, and voices have been recorded, Shott said.
<br><br>
&quot;Professional ghost hunters and/or professional photographers have confirmed all the photos I've taken on ghost hunts,&quot; she said.
<br><br>
Not all visitors to the prison have left the prison not seeing or hearing anything out of the usual.
<br><br>
Beth *Removed for Privacy*, a student who runs a paranormal Web site called <a href="index.html">Grave Addiction</a>, reported nothing unusual during her visit. 
<br><br>
&quot;I didn't experience anything paranormal while I was there, but we did hear a ghostly 'hello' on one of our recordings.&quot;
