On January 20, 2008 I received an e-mail from Isabel H. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I am a natural atheist: I believe in nothing, and I need to see things for them to be believed.
<br><br>
I was talking on the phone with my aunty Caroline, who was speaking to me about Ouija boards, which I found interesting and amusing at the same time. I listened carefully, and learned that several members of my family had previously had bad experiences from Ouija boards. She told me never to go near them, and that meddling with anything like that is a bad idea. Naturally, I wanted to try it. Firstly, she told me about one of my other aunties, Annabel, who after playing with a Ouija board as a teenager, had several horrific dreams, became delusional and obsessive over things, kept seeing devil faces, hearing babies crying, and was generally a mess. I also do not believe encouraging Ouija boards is a good idea. After that particular conversation, I did feel particularly uneasy in my house. I had not used the Ouija board yet, but found myself imagining noises and felt something dark lingering in my bedroom. I do not know how this happened.
<br><br>
That night, I printed out a paper Ouija board, and a curious friend and I tried it. What happened next has converted me away from atheism for my life, but I am glad to announce I did not have a bad experience. I think.
<br><br>
Anya (my friend): Are there any spirits here with us?<br>
(No response)<br>
<br>
Me (Speaking to Anya): See, I thought it was fake.<br>
Board: Real<br>
<br>
Anya: This is real?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Oh. My. God.<br>
Board: Charlotte<br>
<br>
Me: Me?<br>
Anya: It's speaking to you.<br>
Board: I was in your dream<br>
<br>
Anya: What dream?<br>
Board: Her dream<br>
<br>
Me: Mine?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What dream?<br>
(Long pause)<br>
Board: I was the white butterfly<br>
<br>
Me: Erm, okay. [Freaked out now]<br>
Anya: What is your name?<br>
(No response)<br>
<br>
Me (Speaking to Anya): Has it gone?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Anya: Why not?<br>
(Pause)<br>
Board: I protect you both<br>
<br>
Me: From what?<br>
(No response for a long time)<br>
Board: good bye<br>
<br>
Any clues as to what this means? Please tell me!
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Isabel, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on to her.
