On August 23, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jayme J. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This morning, August 23, around 2 A.M. through 3:30 A.M., my roommate and I were playing with our Ouija board. We had strange experiences before with it, but we were acting silly and asking it stupid questions.
<br><br>
Me: Who was my first crush?<br>
Board: K-U-R-T.<br>
<br>
Which was true, though I never told anyone about it.<br>
<br>
Katie: Who was my first kiss?<br>
Board: E-T-H-A-N.<br>
<br>
Katie: That one doesn't count. Who kissed me in kindergarten?<br>
Board: B-A-I-L-Y.<br>
<br>
The board proceeded to tell us where they were and her reaction to the kiss, which she had never told me before.<br>
<br>
We proceeded to ask different questions of that nature. Then, weird things happened. Without prompt, it began to spell:<br>
<br>
Board: E-R-I-N.<br>
<br>
Which is the name of my best friend who died.<br>
<br>
Me: Why did you spell that?<br>
<br>
It wouldn't tell us. It kept spelling &quot;M-A-M-A-M-A&quot; and &quot;Z-A-Z-A-Z-A.&quot; Finally, after yelling at it, it answered.<br>
<br>
Board: E-R-E-R.<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: E-R-I-N.<br>
<br>
Me: Say something only she would know.<br>
Board: B-E-S-T-F-<br>
<br>
Me: Please don't spell that. Say something else.<br>
Board: B-A-I-L-E-Y.<br>
<br>
Which is my other best friend.<br>
<br>
Board: S-T-A-<br>
Me: Don't say that.<br>
<br>
I assumed it was going to spell &quot;Stacy,&quot; who is my friend who was accidentally involved in her death.<br>
<br>
Me: Tell me the song only she would know makes me think about her.<br>
<br>
Board: A-D-D-I-C-T-E-D.<br>
<br>
Which was correct...of course.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you need to leave?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Okay. Bye.<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Me: What do you need to say?<br>
Board: L-O-V-E.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you know I was thinking that?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want me to say it?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: I love you. Bye.<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
After recollecting myself, we gave it another shot. And things got even weirder.<br>
<br>
Me: What did Wendy break?<br>
Board: C-O-O-K-I-E.<br>
<br>
Me: Where did I get my cookie?<br>
<br>
We never recieved the correct answer.<br>
<br>
Me: What's my favorite male name?<br>
Board: N-I-K-O.<br>
<br>
Which is a character from one of my favorite books.<br>
<br>
Me: No. You're wrong. What is my favorite male name?<br>
Board: A-L-E-X.<br>
<br>
(It spelled this several times.)<br>
<br>
Katie: Why do you keep saying that?<br>
Board: F-A-T-H-E-R.<br>
<br>
That is Katie's dad's name.<br>
<br>
Board: K-A-T-I-E M-A-D.<br>
Katie: Why am I mad at him?<br>
<br>
It kept spelling random things. Then, it got yet even stranger.<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: S-A-T-<br>
<br>
We stopped it, afraid it would be Satan. Foolishly, we tried again.<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: Y-A-M-A-S-T-E-R.<br>
<br>
We said goodbye quickly. But then, tried once more.<br>
<br>
Board: A-L-E-X.<br>
<br>
Katie: What about him?<br>
Board: F-A-T-H-E-R. W-E-W-A-N-<br>
<br>
Scared it was going to say it wanted something or someone, we said goodbye again, finally giving up completely.
