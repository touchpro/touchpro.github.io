On December 19, 2004 I received an e-mail from fourteen year old Jessica about her creepy experience with a new ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;When I went shopping the Friday after Thanksgiving, I bought myself a Ouija board. My mother of course bought it for me, since I am only 14. My mother gave my grandma the receipt from shopping, which had the price of the Ouija board on it, which she specifically told me not to buy (My family is very in tune with the paranormal). Well a few weeks later my grandma told me that she burned it. So I bought another one a few weeks later. I didn't use it much, and I tried it by myself. It never moved too much by myself. I put it away.  And just the other day, I took it out, and tried again by myself, noticing the side panels of my box, was slit completely, I put the board away. And I looked at the cover, and side of my box. I noticed a lot of silver and it had my name on the top part of the box, must have been 4 times with hearts all over it. And on the side panel, it said GiGi, and Ma then underneath it, it said &quot;Jessica (heart) Ma.&quot; I got terribly scared. So I looked at the box again and I noticed the Parker Brothers symbol was completely scratched out. Like the spirit was telling me that it wasn't just a game. The way the spirit wrote...it was all backwards and fancy looking, but with swirls in the letters. Since it was backwards, I held the box up to my mirror, and it said &quot;Jessica, Play with me&quot; and the 'O' of Ouija was swirled completely, and inside it, it said &quot;Take me out&quot; (Since I only did play with it once or twice.) According to my mom, GiGi could have been the spirits name. But, it's still a mystery what 'Ma' stands for. I thought Ouija boards were all fun and games, but they're unexplainable mysteries.&quot;
