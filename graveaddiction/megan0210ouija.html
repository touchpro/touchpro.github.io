On February 10, 2010 I received an e-mail from Megan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This was on, Saturday February 6, 2009.
<br><br>
I (Megan) went to my friend Ashley's for her birthday party. Some friends were there: Kristen, Caitlin, Brandon, Ashley, Me, Elena, and Patricia. Around 10:30 PM, I decided we should play the Ouija board.
<br><br>
We turned all the lights off since I brought a glow-in-the-dark Ouija Board. Brandon was too scared to play, so the rest of us were playing.
<br><br>
We got in touch with a spirit named Rusty, who was a slave and died in 1868. We asked if he liked Caitlin, and apparently he did. A lot. While we were asking questions I looked in the furnace room, and I saw this blob of a white light. I didn't think anything of it. So later on I looked back in there, and it was gone. Then I said something about it and Patricia saw it too, but it was gone! It freaked me out. So I sat on the couch with Brandon and Patricia while everyone else played. I've noticed spirits like to lie, even if they're good. So don't take it too seriously, but also don't laugh at it hysterically.
<br><br>
Later on Elena and Kristen went home. Caitlin normally can't say &quot;lip ring,&quot; it comes out &quot;lip wing&quot; or &quot;lip ling.&quot;  And she's also constantly hyper and obnoxious at times. But she was very chill and relaxed. It was around 2 AM. I asked her to say &quot;lip ring,&quot; and she did five times perfectly! I was freaking out and asking her what's wrong. She was zoned out a bit.  I was punching her in the leg, and normally she'd get mad easily. But she didn't even notice.  Then she goes &quot;OW, my leg!&quot;  I go, &quot;Yeah I was just punching you in the leg.&quot; Then she laid down for exactly 60 seconds and was back to herself. She got possessed by Rusty, or she was tricking us so we'd get scared.
<br><br>
Either way, the Ouija board was very interesting. Nothing bad has happened to me or my friends. So I'd recommend it for a fun game to play with a group of friends. Just remember, be polite. Say thank you, goodbye, ask questions about itself, etc.
