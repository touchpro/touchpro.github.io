On June 19, 2007 I received an e-mail from Alix about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My e-mail is in regards to one of the stories on your site titled &quot;Relationship with the Board.&quot;
<br><br>
The girl who shared her story described being able to hear the answer before it's been spelled out, and a certain comfort from the board.
<br><br>
I am in the exact same situation.
<br><br>
Three weeks and four days ago my friends and I made an ouija board out of cardboard.  My friends contacted a spirit before I was there, and informed me that his name was Chris.
<br><br>
We started talking to him everyday, asking all kinds of questions.
<br><br>
One day my friends and I were sitting at my house, talking to chris when we finished.  I wasn't finished asking questions yet, so I asked if he could move the planchette (which was a bottle cap) with just my hand on it and he did.  Five minutes later, I put my finger on a dust-covered speaker and asked if he could move my finger, and he did!
<br><br>
So I started talking to him more and more on my own, and here's what he told me:
<br><br>
His name is Chris.<br>
We were married in a prior life.<br>
He said he's my guardian and that he is always with me, even when I'm not talking to him.<br>
I trust that he is my guardian.<br>
<br>
One day my cousin and I were in our grandparent's basement, and we were playing with an ouija board.  I asked if the spirit was Chris.  It said yes, and then immediately spelled out &quot;be careful.&quot; I asked if he meant to be careful about bad spirits, and he went to yes and immediately to finish.  My cousin wasn't satisfied so we tried again.  This time the bottle cap moved around the board extremely fast.  Chris usually goes on little &quot;jaunts&quot; around the board, so I wasn't sure if it was him or not.  Then I suddenly got this very bad, eerie feeling and immediately stopped.
<br><br>
That night I was at my house alone, and I was scared shitless.  I went upstairs and grabbed a rosary I had bought on a field trip  and started praying nonstop.  After awhile I felt much better and relaxed a little, but I didn't let go of the rosary.  No sooner than I had stopped praying, I felt what seemed like something trying to take the rosary out of my hands.  I didn't stay home that night, and three days later I asked chris if a bad spirit followed me and he said yes.
