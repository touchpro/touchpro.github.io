On March 24, 2008 I received an e-mail from Laura Hernandez about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I wrote before stating that I only now speak to my mom and brother on the board.  This story took place when my brother was still alive 4 years ago, and my youngest daughter was a baby.
<br><br>
My husband and I pulled out the board, and my mom identified herself with all 3 of her initials.  She then informed us that she is so happy because my daughter can see her.  We asked her, what do you exactly mean she can see you?  She said, I make her laugh and she points to me.  We asked her to prove it to us if that's ok, my daughter at the time was an infant.  We placed her on the bed beside us, and she starts immediately looking up, and laughing as if someone was tickling her.  Our mouths dropped.
<br><br>
At the time my brother was still alive, and he came into the bedroom and we informed him of what just happened.  He was too afraid to touch the board.  My mother said to him, wow your so tall and handsome.  My brother didn't really want to believe in the board and walked out of the room.  My mom said, I will see him soon and it will be ok.  I asked her what she meant by that, and she said, he will not be afraid anymore and speak to me.
<br><br>
A couple of months later my brother passed away in his sleep from a diabetic shock.  When it happened, my husband and I immediately pulled out the board.  My mom said, I told you that I will see him soon and he will be ok.  We asked her why didn't you tell us he was going to pass away, she said, I cannot tell you these things, I cannot play God.  But I knew.  I asked her if he was with her and she said, no not yet.  Once he is buried he will come to me.  She said its as if she is in an airport waiting for someone anxiously.  She described their reunion so beautiful and it just made me cry but I also cried of happiness.
<br><br>
Once my brother was buried, we pulled out the board again and my brother spoke to me.  He said not to cry for him, that he is in a better place and to think of it as if he was on a long vacation, and writes letters to me.  Said as long as I have this board, he will always keep in contact with me.  He also described his death and said its better that he left.
<br><br>
My brother, every now and then when we have the time to talk on the ouija, will come out and tell me he loves me and that he wants me to visit and clean up his grave a little more often.
<br><br>
3/22/08
<br><br>
I got on the board to say happy Easter to my mom, and the first thing she writes, after her initials, is a date 11/23/08.  I asked her what's that date for, and she said I will be a great grandmom.  I said, who, who is having a baby?  She said and YOU will be a grandmother.  I was in shock and said, no mom your mistaken, I am not a grandma.  I then said, WAIT, I called up my son and he immediately starts crying.  I said what's up, tell me whats going on.  He said ma, I was about to call you but don't know how to tell you this.  I said, is your girlfriend prego, he said HOW DO YOU KNOW...I said don't worry about it, I had the feeling... She knew before I did.  She said not to worry about my son and his girlfriend, they will be ok, and that she and my brother are watching over both of them.  I was so distraught as my son is in college and so is his girlfriend.  My mom said, he will continue with school, don't worry.
<br><br>
It's so amazing to have my ouija board when it comes to certain real life situations.  I so believe in it, and every word she says to me.  Like I mentioned before, I speak to no one else but her and now my brother.  If there is someone from my past that has passed on, or my husband's past, she asks us first, and says there is someone here that wants to say hello.  She also informed me that evil spirits want to take over at times, but she will not allow it, and to only speak to her.  As long as she says her initials first, that's how she identifies herself, she said if someone else comes out to say goodbye.
