On June 13, 2008 I received an e-mail from Emily about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Emily. I'm fourteen years old, and I'd like to share my Ouija Board story with you.
<br><br>
For a long time now, my cousin (Sarah, 15) and I have been discussing the possibility of using an Ouija Board when she visits. She convinced her mom to let her buy her one, and we put it to use.
<br><br>
We've had two encounters with a ghost, maybe not the same one:
<br><br>
A few years ago, Sarah and her older sister, Maggie (17 or 18, don't remember), were sleeping over at my house. We were lying in our add-on room; Maggie was on the couch, Sarah and I on the floor. We heard a noise (it was the fridge, but at the time Maggie did not realize that) and looked over the couch and screamed. I jolted up, and she went, &quot;What was that light?!&quot; I laughed, thinking she was joking. However, she was not. By our pool table, Maggie explained, she saw a ghostly figure.
<br><br>
Last year (possibly Christmas or Thanksgiving 2007), we were lying in our add-on room again. Maggie on the couch, Sarah and I on the floor. We were hyper and bored, so I grabbed the flashlight that was lying next to me and started playing with it. I did puppet shows with my hands - an alligator and a bunny. Then I pretended to be...well, rather large. I figured out if I held the light next to my thigh and tilted it at an angle, it looked like I had very large legs. I started moving my leg around, we were all laughing and joking. Until I tilted it back and forth when it lit up part of the ceiling. We all screamed - we saw a face. It looked pretty pissed off. I clicked the light off and hid in my sleeping bag. Then we noticed there was a water bottle on the table between the couch and Sarah and I. Maggie and Sarah are convinced that it was the outline of the water bottle, but I'm not so sure.
<br><br>
So about a month ago, Sarah brought down her Ouija Board. Maggie, unfortunately, had dance camp and could not participate with us - she was still up at her home.  After discussing it for a while, we finally got down to business. Me being paranoid, grabbed a pure silver spoon to place on the board (I've read somewhere that pure silver only allows good spirits to come).  Sitting in my parents bathroom (a quiet place) around 3:00 PM (so it was light outside) we got to work. The following conversation happened...not word for word, but seeing as how I'm Emily and I know my cousin very well, I can pretty much fill in the stuff I don't remember:
<br><br>
Emily: Does anyone want to speak with me?<br>
Sarah: I want to speak to my grandpa (her grandfather had just recently died)<br>
Emily: It doesn't work like that, Sarah.<br>
Sarah: Oh. Right.<br>
Emily: So does anyone wish to speak to us?<br>
<br>
We waited for a long time. No response.<br>
<br>
Sarah: It's that stupid spoon. Take it off.<br>
Emily: NO! It gives us protection.<br>
Sarah: (removes spoon)<br>
Emily: Sarah, stop it! (places spoon back on the board)<br>
Sarah: Fine. God, Emily.<br>
Emily: (shakes head)<br>
Sarah: Does anybody want to speak to me?<br>
Emily: (moves planchette gently)<br>
Sarah: (glances up, eyes wide) Stop it, Emily.<br>
Emily: It's not me, Sarah.<br>
Sarah: Oh.<br>
Emily: (cracks up) Sorry. Sorry. I had to do it.<br>
Sarah: I hate you.<br>
Emily: What else is new. Now, you ask it. I'm tired of asking.<br>
Sarah: Does anybody wish to speak with us?<br>
(Planchette moves)<br>
Emily: (laughing) Very funny, Sarah. But you should have waited a few more minutes - way to obvious.<br>
Sarah: I thought it was you.<br>
Emily: Shit.<br>
Sarah: Let's wait.<br>
Emily: NO! Goodbye! (moves Planchette towards goodbye. Then realizes spoon is not on the board)<br>
<br>
Later, when it was darker and we were in another room (the add-on room, actually):
<br><br>
Sarah: Don't wimp out okay?<br>
Emily: Yeah, sure, whatever.<br>
Sarah: Is there anyone here who wants to speak to us?<br>
Emily: *giggles*<br>
Sarah: SHUT UP! We need to be serious!<br>
Emily: Oh right. Wait, the spoon!<br>
Sarah: Leave it.<br>
Emily: (puts spoon on board)<br>
Sarah: You are so stupid.<br>
Emily: So says you. Ask again.<br>
Sarah: Is there anyone here who wants to speak to us?<br>
(Planchette moves towards yes)<br>
Emily: Sarah, cut it out. When are you going to learn you can't prank me like that? I already pulled it first.<br>
Sarah: It wasn't me.<br>
Emily: It wasn't?<br>
Sarah: No.<br>
Emily: HOLY CRAP. SAY GOODBYE.<br>
Sarah: No! You wimp!<br>
Emily: Am not!<br>
Sarah: Is there anyone here-<br>
Emily: SAY GOODBYE.<br>
Sarah: No!<br>
Emily: If you don't do it I will!<br>
Sarah: Why?<br>
Emily: Because I'm scared, okay?<br>
Sarah: (finally looks at Emily) Fine.<br>
Emily: Thanks. Goodbye.<br>
Sarah: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
I believe we closed the board correctly, but since then I have been getting goosebumps at random moments, or feel I am being watched. Any helpful advice for me to not wimp out next time?
<br><br>
I swear, this is all one hundred percent true. The board probably didn't move that well because it was our first use, and we are both very young, therefore we don't have that much energy to share. Besides, I bet we were both doubting it a little. I know this seems really lame, but I was really scared. Ahah. hopefully later this summer I'll grow a backbone and we can try for realz!
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or information for Emily, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on to her.
