On August 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jack about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It started about two months ago, when I first moved into my new house.  I was kind of excited, because when I had played my ouija board in my previous house I wouldn't get much response all the time.  So I was excited to see if a spirit was living in my new house. I had tried using the board a few times, yet I wasn't getting much response. I thought that maybe because I'm using it on my own there isn't enough energy, so I got my brother to play with me.  It started slowly moving before we even asked a question. The story went a little bit like this:
<br><br>
(at this time it was when the planchette was moving by itself, but I thought it was my brother.  So I kept telling him not to move it, although the planchette was only moving in small circles...it wasn't spelling out anything yet)
<br><br>
Me: Hello, is there anybody here in this room with us now?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Hello, what is your name?<br>
Board: I don't know<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been alive yet? (because I've read that some people know who they're going to be before they are born)<br>
Board: yes idiot<br>
<br>
Me: Am I an idiot?<br>
Board: duh<br>
<br>
Me: OK, but then how do you not know your name?<br>
Board: I do, I'm not telling<br>
<br>
Me: Why won't you tell us your name?<br>
Board: secret<br>
<br>
Me:  OK then, so how old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 26<br>
<br>
Me: Are you male or female?<br>
Board: female<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know me or my brother?<br>
Board: janet janet janet (which is the name of my friend)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know my friend Janet?<br>
Board: I also know Lorriane (which is my youth worker from my community where I used to live)<br>
<br>
Me: How do you know Janet and Lorriane?<br>
Board: who<br>
<br>
Me: You just said that you know my friend Janet and my youth worker Lorriane.<br>
Board: I don't, sorry<br>
<br>
Brother: Show us a sign that you're here.<br>
Me: No don't, please don't give us a sign.  Billy (my brother), you're not supposed to ask that.<br>
<br>
Then, all of a sudden, we heard a crash from downstairs. Neither of us wanted to check it out, but I was just hoping it was my dog. We both eventually went down and saw beer all over the floor.  Our dog was barking very visiously at nothing. We went back up to my room and continued with the session.<br>
<br>
Me: Was that you who did that?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: thirsty<br>
<br>
Me: I didn't know dead people can get thirsty.<br>
Board: They can't<br>
<br>
Me: Then how can you be thirsty?<br>
Board: alchol<br>
<br>
Me: Do you mean alcohol?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want alcohol?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: thirsty<br>
<br>
Me:  Well, if you're thirsty you have water, not alcohol.<br>
Board: I drink a lot<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die because of alcohol?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me:  How did you die?<br>
Board: Rape<br>
<br>
Me: You were raped?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who by?<br>
Board: man<br>
<br>
Me: What man?<br>
Board: Don't know<br>
<br>
Me: Is it ok if we take a little break?  We are very tired, and our arms are sore.<br>
Board: Yes, come back<br>
<br>
Me: OK, we will be back soon.  Goodbye.<br>
Board: goodbye<br>
<br>
About an hour later my brother and I went back to playing the game, but no one was answering.  I kept asking if she was there (the woman we were talking to before), but no one replied. I had tried a lot within the next week trying to contact her, but nothing.
<br><br>
About a week or so later, a woman came into my house at 3 in the morning and went up to my bedroom (I live in a 3 story house, and my room is at the very top).  She woke me up. I just screamed once, and my eyes were so wide that I thought they were going to come out because I was so shocked. She sat on my bed, and I was asking her who she was.  She said that she didn't know.  I asked her if she knew me, and she said no.  She tried to fall asleep on my bed, but I wouldn't let her. I started talking to her for about 30 minutes. She was a nice woman, but I could smell beer on her, and she was definitely drunk.  Now, I know what you're thinking - WOW...that's exactly what the woman on the board said about not knowing who she is and spilling the beer.  Well, I asked her where she lived, and she said she didn't know.  She told me that she knew my mum and my dad, and that my dad would always beat me up (which he doesn't).  She also said that she knew my brother Andrew, and that she had been friends with him for 2 years.  She also said she knew my friends Janice, Janet, and Lorriane.  I was really scared because a woman has come into my house at 3 in the morning drunk and is trying to sleep on my bed.  I didn't try and take advantage of this because I'm not that type of person. My mum shouted up to me from her bedroom, &quot;Jack, who are you talking to?&quot;  I said no one its the t.v., and she said to turn it off and get to sleep as it was about 4 in the morning now. I said to the woman in my room, &quot;What will I do if my mum comes up?&quot;  She said, &quot;I know, we will tell her that one of your friends tried to rape me because that's actually what did happen, but the man didnt get far enough.&quot;
<br><br>
So eventually I got her downstairs into my living room. Not really scared at this point, because she seemed OK.  But then I got her out of my house, locked the door, ran upstairs, and told my mum. My dad works on a late shift, so he works 7 PM to 7 AM.  When he came home, my mum told him what happened and they phoned the police (by the way, my door wasn't locked because my mum was so busy she forgot to lock it before she went to bed).  They asked me what happened, and for a description.  Funny enough, the woman looked like my ex-youth worker who quit her job.  However, I wear glasses and didn't have them on at the time, so I couldn't see 100%. I have never been in touch with that woman from the board, or the woman in my house, but I think they might be the same people...that she was a ghost seeking help, and in some way I think I helped her because nothing unusual has happened in my house since.
