Today was a great day at work...I got to leave at 12:30!  Leaving early always makes the day a great one!<br /><br />This evening I met Chrissie and Jennifer to exchange gifts.  We had a good time, and I really like the gifts they got me!  After our gift exchange I drove to my parents' house since I was already half way there.  My sister's boyfriend made lasagna for them (my mom swears he makes the best lasagna <b>ever</b>) and there was a lot leftover so I got to take some home for lunch tomorrow.   <br /><br />Now for sad news:  This weekend when I went down to my parents' place to help bake cookies, I noticed something different when I got out of the truck.  It didn't take me long to realize what was different - Cherokee, my dog that we had for about fourteen years, was nowhere to be seen.  His house wasn't outside at the top of the hill anymore.  I knew that one of two things happened: 1) They moved his house closer to the barn so he'd stay warmer, or 2) he died.  He had hip/leg problems and when I let him loose at Halloween he had a terrible time walking.  Instead of asking my parents I decided to wait to see if they said anything to me first.  A few hours later they still didn't say anything, so when I was alone in the kitchen with my sister and her boyfriend I asked Katy "when did Cherokee die".  She looked surprised and told me they put him to sleep on 12/13...over a week ago!  Katy said mom didn't want to tell me.  So I walked into the living room and calmly asked "so when were you going to tell me about Cherokee".  My mom and dad both got that "deer in the headlights" look, and explained that they didn't want to tell me because they didn't want me to be upset and think they were murderers or something.  Of course I wouldn't have thought that!  They liked Cherokee too, and they wouldn't put him to sleep unless he was in pain.  Mom also said that I told her not to tell me.....which is not technically true.  I told her not to ask for my opinion as to whether or not they should put him to sleep, but I kinda assumed they would tell me afterwards!  Anyway, sounds like they were both extremely upset about having to put him to sleep.  Mom even cried at work when she thought about it, which is another reason why I'm surprised I didn't find out sooner.  I have three friends that work with my mom, and all three knew about it.  I talked with each of them several times last week and no one told me about Cherokee!  I still can't believe it was more than a week later before I found out!  It's not like I wouldn't notice he wasn't there :)  <br /><br />Anyway, I can't think of much else to write about.  If I don't get a chance to write tomorrow, hope you all have a wonderful Christmas!!<br><br>

Here's a cool link: <a href="http://www.kabalarians.com/gkh/your.htm#links">What Does Your Name Mean?</a>.  Just enter your name in the search box, choose male or female, and hit enter.  Here's what Beth means:<br /><br /><blockquote>&quot;The name of Beth brings opportunities for success in business and financial accumulation. It fires you with ambition and promotional ideas, ideas that are original, progressive, and large-scale. With this name, success to you is a foregone conclusion, for you cannot conceive any reason for not reaching all your goals, as you have self-sufficiency, supreme confidence, boundless energy, and enthusiasm. As long as you have a sense of freedom from monotony and drudgery, and can see progress being made, you feel buoyant and optimistic. However, obstacles and frustration can give rise to feelings of impatience, intolerance, and depression. The ever-present desire to progress does not allow you proper relaxation or the proper expression of the softer feminine qualities of sympathy, encouragement, and affection. Others see you as rather shrewd and calculating. Your intense, restless nature can bring on tension which affects the solar plexus and digestion, or the female organs.&quot;</blockquote><br />Anyway, work has been keeping me super busy lately.  Hopefully things will settle down a bit in a week or so. <br><br>

An update for all of you who read my post from last night:  My mom found her Eminem CD last night.  It was under my dad's "O Brother Where Art Thou" CD!<br /><br />Since I mentioned my mom, let me tell you about the dream she had last night.  Wait, first let me tell you that Saturday afternoon I was telling her about the unsuccessful Ouija board experience I had with Susan and Chrissie.  She informed me that we probably weren't doing it right (or taking it seriously enough), and that she'd show us how it works.  I was shocked to hear my mom say this, afterall, we're talking about the same lady who wouldn't let me bring a Ouija board into her house back when I still lived at home.  Anyway, back to her dream last night.  Mom said that she had a dream that a person who passed away back when she was in high school came and told her that she should <b>not</b> use the Ouija board.  He knows that she can get it to work, but she needs to stay away from it.  OK, this might not sound too scary until you hear her Ouija board story from back when she was in High School.  <b><i>Way</i></b> back in the late 1960's my mom and a friend tried to contact a classmate that had died in a train wreck.  They asked to hear a train whistle to know whether or not the person they were contacting was present.  A few seconds later they heard a loud train whistle, but laughed and thought nothing of it since Bonnie lived right next to a railroad track.  However, when they looked outside there was no train in sight, and the whistle sounded like it was right by the house.  Then the message indicator on their Ouija board started spinning around like crazy!  It scared my mom and her friend to death, which is why my mom never wanted me to play with one.  My mom said that the guy in her dream last night was this same guy they tried contacting years ago, and that he was even wearing the suit he was buried in.  Pretty strange.  Needless to say, she said she will <b>NOT</b> be showing us how to use the board correctly!<br /><br />This week has been going really fast...and I can't believe it's the week before Christmas!  I only have one present left to buy, which really isn't bad at all.  Of course, I probably won't be saying it "isn't bad at all" after fighting with the crowds to get that last gift!  Each year I swear that I will get all of my shopping done before Thanksgiving, but it never happens...I can't even get it done before December!<br><br>

I just remembered that I forgot to mention something else about last Friday.  Susan gave me a present, a bumper sticker:<br /><br /><center><img src="bfe.jpg"></center><br /><br />My very own BFE bumper sticker!  Susan had these printed up, and it made me laugh!  If you think about it, just about everyone has been to a place they consider to be in the middle of BFE.  And some of us, like myself, even grew up in small towns considered to be BFE!  <br /><br />This afternoon I was talking to my mom (I can't remember why I called her, but I did have a reason).  In the middle of our conversation she had a crisis...she couldn't find her Eminem CD!  Yes, my mother is an Eminem fan.  She has all of his CDs and she takes them to work with her each day.  I think Eminem probably rates about third on her list of favorite bands/artists, with Rob Zombie and Disturbed being #1 and #2.  Of course, this is just a guess since she may have a country artist that ranks higher.  Anyway, my mom was totally freaking out about "losing Eminem".  At one point she thought she found it, but it turned out to be her Gregorian Chants CD.  Close enough, right?!  I'm sure her coworkers were cracking up listening to my mom go on and on about her lost Eminem CD!  <br /><br />Speaking of CDs, my friend Michelle gave me a CD to listen to this afternoon...<i>Moment of Glory</i> (I think that's the title anyway!)by the Scorpions.  It was the Scorpions signing with a Philharmonic Orchestra, and it was just too funny!  I never thought I'd listen to "classic" Scorpions songs sung with an orchestra and backup singers!  I thought Metallica's <i>S&M</i> was rather humorous, but this was even better.<br /><br />Time to get my laundry out of the dryer...hopefully I won't need to iron anything for work tomorrow!<br><br>

Nevermind waiting til tonight to blog, I've decided to go ahead and blog during lunch.  I was supposed to have lunch with a friend here at work, but she called this morning from home and she sounds really sick.  She hopes to be back to work tomorrow though.  I always enjoy lunch with Cassandra...we worked together in LHS (Life and Health Systems) a few years ago, and now she works in IAS too!  <br /><br />My hands are extremely dry today.  Let me backup and explain:<br /><br />This past Thursday (12/12) I went to an auction down in Rushville at <a href="http://www.clum.com">Clum Auctions, Inc</a>.  They have a <b>big</b> barn that they hold auctions in each month.  This auction had a lot of glassware advertised, so I decided to take the day off work and go.  We got there around 8:30AM and looked around all of the stuff in the inside, heated lower part of the barn.  There was lots of kitchen depression glass, glass rolling pins, antique furniture, etc.  Basically, all of the really, really expensive stuff was down there.  While my mom and I were looking around downstairs my dad went and checked out the upper part of the barn and all of the primitives outside.  He came back downstairs and told us that most of the stuff up there was junk like old, dirty glass.  The "old dirty glass" statement intrigued me, so I went to check it out around 9:00.  And I'm glad I did...the upper, unheated part of the barn contained tables filled with boxes of old Anchor Hocking Fire King stuff from the 1940's-1970's...which is the stuff I collect!!  They auctioned off all of the primitives and stuff that were sitting outside on the grass first, then they made it to the box lots in the barn sometime between 1:30-2:00.  After paying $18 for 9 big boxes of glassware around 4:30 I decided to check out.  There were a few more boxes I wanted to bid on, but 9 boxes is a lot of glass and one can only cram so many boxes into a car!  I found quite a few surprises in the boxes, which was quite exciting.  For example, in one box that I thought just contained a bunch of Fire King brown Kimberly mugs, I found a pair of Anchor Hocking Early American Prescut Individual Shakers!!!  Those alone were worth way more than $18.  <br /><br />Of course, you're probably still wondering why my hands are so dry and cracked.  Well, like my dad said, those boxes were full of "old, dirty" glass.  Some of the glasses even had dead bugs in them, which was quite disgusting.  So I needed to wash everything in the nine boxes.  I spent about 4 hours on Saturday night doing dishes!!!  I even used Palmolive since it's not supposed to dry out hands, but that's probably only true for normal usage and 4 hours of doing dishes definitely isn't normal!!  All of the glass looks nice, clean, and shiny now so it was definitely worth dry hands!<br /><br />I didn't spend my whole weekend doing dishes though!  Friday night I went to the <a href="http://www.battelle.org">Battelle</a> Holiday Mixer with Chrissie and Susan (who both work there).  Battelle's holiday mixer was very nice - they rented out the ballroom at the Buckeye Hall of Fame Cafe, provided sandwiches, appetizers, beer, and wine...all for free!  They also rented buses to shuttle people from Battelle to Buckeye Hall of Fame.  Pretty cool.  I got to meet some of their coworkers that I hear them mention from time to time, and I even got to see their office and labs.  That was really cool, because I never toured a non-school science lab before.  <br /><br />After the mixer we went back to my place to try out the Ouija board.  We lit a single black taper candle, turned out the lights, turned off the phone, and placed two fingers each on the message indicator...and absolutely <b>NOTHING</b> happened!  Perhaps it's because Susan and I both laughed, or perhaps because Chrissie was the only one whodidn't doubt that the board would work.  Only three questions were answered:<br /><ol><br /><li>Chrissie asked how many spirits were in my house.  The board said 8.<br /><li>Chrissie asked for a name, and the board slowly (and I do mean painfully slow!!) spelled out the name "Lex".  Which might have been a spirit pretending to be my great grandfather, because all of the old letters I have addressed to him by friends refer to him as "Leck".  It was still kinda creepy.<br /><li>Chrissie also asked if one of the people who works with her (and Susan) is gay.  The board said no.<br /></ol><br />Even though this experience made me doubt the Ouija board even more, I still plan to have the Ouija party at my place early next year.  Some of the friends I have invited have had good results with the board so maybe the next time we'll have better results.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to spend my entire lunch break blogging...I want to get some work done so I don't end up spending the night here!<br><br>

Freezing rain and snow make for a <b><i>wonderful</i></b> drive to work.  No, not really.  It took me double the time it normally takes, so it's a good thing I left early!!  The roads really were awful, I was stressed by the time I finally made it here.  And I have a short drive compared to a lot of my coworkers, I bet it was even worse for them!<br /><br />Sheri gave me a present...it's a plant that her grandmother was going to throw out.  The reason she gave me this plant is for the pot it's planted in.  It's planted in an old kitchen canister that has a frog on it!  It's really cute.<br><br>

Davis had a meeting come up this afternoon so I didn't get to have lunch with him and Mark.  And unfortunately, I have a thousand meetings scheduled daily for the next few weeks so I had to reschedule our lunch for the end of the month.  Normally it wouldn't be a big deal to skip some of these status meetings, but since the project we're working on it pretty high profile it'd look bad if I skipped just to have lunch with friends.  Of course, I may need to go to lunch with friends just to keep my sanity...testing isn't going the greatest right now (which is such an understatement!) and I <b>need</b> to get away from my desk sometimes.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't think of anything non-work related to write about tonight so I suppose I'll just wait until tomorrow to write again!<br><br>

Today was one of those Mondays that everyone dreads.  I got to work early today since it's the first day of testing and I had conversions to verify.  Well, turns out I really didn't need to get in early afterall since we weren't able to verify the conversions until after my normal starting time.  Then nothing else went right either, we weren't even able to start testing until late this afternoon due to test region problems.  Anyway, I should stop complaining, this is the sort of stuff that makes testing exciting!!  And I really am being honest, not sarcastic!  Some people hate testing, but I admit that I kinda find it exciting, especially when there are lots of defects and things aren't working.  I must be a sick individual to like that stuff, right?!<br /><br />I forgot to mention something in last night's post about the psychic party.  One of my coworkers was talking about it today which reminded me!  Gayle said that a lot of the ghosts in my house are male, and when I told my friends this after the reading they all gave me a hard time about it and made plenty of jokes...my dad even called me a revolving door!  But the joke that really seemed to crack everyone up was Chrissie's comment: "Wow Beth, you need to stop bringing home all those deadbeat guys!".  Yeah, it's a pretty cheesy joke, but it made us laugh! :)<br /><br />I think I may have talked quite a few people into the Ouija party I want to have early next year.  I can't wait, I'm already starting to plan it!<br /><br />So other than my testing adventures at work, it was a rather dull day.  I think I may be going to lunch with Davis and Mark tomorrow, as long as Davis doesn't have any meetings scheduled.  I haven't seen him for ages, so it should be lots of fun to catch up on the new stuff, and to reminince about the old days back when the three of us worked together.  Davis compares the memories of that old area we worked in to Vietnam flashbacks!  And you know, I kinda agree with him :)  But even though we all hated working on that project, I think we all agree that for the most part we worked with a great group of people.  Hopefully I'll have some fun stories to blog about tomorrow night!<br><br>

The psychic party turned out great!  I always worry about being a bad hostess and having parties that people don't enjoy, but everyone seemed to have lots of fun!!  But before I go into details about the party, let me tell you about the stuff the psychic/medium told me...<br /><ol><br /><li>Gayle told me that I do have spirits/ghosts in my apartment, but none are harmful.  She says that some are family, but most are just spirits that are attracted to me.  She says I have <b>lots</b> of positive energy around me, and spirits seem to follow me home.  She said that quite a few are from my cemetery explorations!  I found it very interesting that when she got to my place, the first thing she looked at was my great grandmother's lace tablecloth...she went over to it without me saying a word about it!  <br /><li>This is related to the ghost stuff, but she also assured me that I'm not having a breakdown.  She couldn't have possibly known that I was worried about that just from looking at me.  She said that the shadows and little twinkly lights I see around the apartment are spirits.  She said my psychic abilities are really starting to open up, and she said she's excited because they should start to open up more.  Gayle thinks I am <b>very</b> psychic and gave me a few tips on developing my abilities.  The other psychic I saw over two years ago said similiar things about me.<br /><li>Gayle told me that she does see me getting married someday, but she also said she thought it was strange since she also sensed this was something I didn't want to hear.  Which is true, I'm not one of those normal girls that dreams about getting married.  Guess I'm abnormal.  She doesn't see me getting married anytime soon, but probably in my late twenties.  I thought that was interesting too, because the other psychic also told me that she saw me getting married, and she guessed around the time I turn 28.<br /><li>She said she wasn't sure about kids.  She sees me maybe having one, but not more than that.  I still can't imagine myself having any.  Don't get me wrong...I like kids, but only when they can talk.  Babies absolutely terrify me.  People always guess that it's because babies seem fragile, but that's not it.  It's that whole talking thing, when they're upset I need them to tell me what's wrong, not cry!  Anyway, that's another discussion, let's get back to the psychic!<br /><li>Another thing she told me was to stop worrying about my job.  She says I don't need to worry about getting laid off.  I guess I kinda knew that, but I always worry about "what if?".  Tied to that, she also told me to stop worrying about my family members getting laid off, we'll all keep our jobs.<br /><li>Gayle also told me that I need to get a part time job doing something that interests me and would be fun.  Not for the money so much, but to get me out of the house.  She said that I'm one of those people that needs a purpose to get out, just going out drinking isn't purpose enough.  Which is very true, but all of my friends acted surprised when I told them after my reading, so I guess this isn't common knowledge about me.  Maybe I'll consider doing that, I do think working at an antique store or even a pet store could be fun!<br /><li>One thing she said almost scared me.  Well not really, just the way she started the statement.  She said "I don't know how to tell you this, I don't want to offend you...", which made me think it was going to be something bad.  But it wasn't, she just told me that I seem to be more pagan than Christian.  It made me laugh, because I already know that!  I don't even pretend to be a Christian anymore.  I don't go and tell everyone I'm pagan though, I usually just wait until it comes out in a conversation.  So many people around here are born again Christians that I can't openly talk about my religious beliefs for fear that they'll burn me at the stake or something!  OK, maybe I'm exagerating a little...they wouldn't think about starting the Salem witch trails again, but they would give me "you'll burn in the everlasting fires of hell" and the "I'll pray for your soul" speeches that I get so very tired of listening to!<br /></ol><br />Everyone else had good readings too.  Just about everyone was impressed and wants me to have another psychic party soon.  I thought it could be an annual thing, but they're pushing me to make it a semiannual thing!  We'll see about that, there's a lot of prep work involved for me!<br /><br />Also, I think I've talked a few friends into having an "Ouija Party" at my place, sometime after the holidays when it's boring because the weather is gray and dreary and there's nothing to do.  Since I supposedly have lots of spirits living here this could be lots of fun!!<br /><br />Now that the party is over, I should have time to start blogging on a regular basis again!<br><br>

It's been a few days since I've blogged.  What have I been up to?  Simple...cleaning.  I enjoy having people over, but it is a lot of work.  Last night I cleaned all of the aquariums.  I ended up working on that until about 1:30AM, so needless to say I'm exhausted today!  But the aquariums/terrariums all look awesome so it was definitely worth it!  Tonight I need to clean the rest of the house, and tomorrow I need to bake.  Then the party is on Saturday.  Maybe I'll be able to rest on Sunday!<br /><br />I got an e-mail from Chrissie this morning...she read my blog and had some comments/additions to the sycophant section of my last post.  She thought I needed to mention that she thinks its funny how I get "all" these awards (just an employee of the month nomination and a few "I Got Caught" awards) <b>without trying</b>!!  She also thinks that I am in denial of accepting that I truly am a sycophant...just think how bad it would be if I actually tried!  She made some good points!<br /><br />Anyway, perhaps I'll write more this evening, but now I need to get back to work.  I just needed to take a quick break from my test plans, or I was afraid I'd go crazy.  Of course, some would say that I already am crazy, but that's just their opinion!<br><br>

My Monday back at work didn't go too bad at all!  Speaking of work, last week I mentioned that Chrissie thought that I'm a sycophant (suckup) at work.  I also promised that I'd expand on that topic and I never did.  Well, here's the story...my department, IAS (Individual Annuity Systems) has an employee of the month contest.  At the end of each month they announce the nominees and winner from the previous month.  Turns out I was one of the nominees for October!  That's why Chrissie thinks I must be a sycophant...only a suckup could get nominated for something like that.  But before I go on, please let me note that Chrissie gets nominated for awards at Battelle (where she works), so if I'm a sycophant she is too!  Of course, anyone who read my nomination form would probably agree with her....it contains phrases like "Beth continues to be the model analyst", "her customer satisfaction scores and testing efforts are always top notch", and my personal favorite "October is just one example of Beth's dedication, determination, and dependability".  But I <i><b>swear</b></i>, I'm not a sycophant!!!  I just do my job and work a little overtime, that's it!  Do you think that makes me a sycophant?<br /><br />I can't believe the psychic party is this weekend!  I have sooooo much to get done!  Having people over is fun, but it also stresses me out a little.  It will be worth it though!<br /><br />My mom sent an e-mail about my haunted tablecloth to one of her friends who happens to be a bit psychic.  She's predicted several things, but she's not an "official" psychic that does readings as her career.  She thinks the ghost in my house is definitely a family member, and that this person is trying to tell me something.  She asked my mom if I had been having specific questions about family history, etc.  Which is weird, because I have been asking a lot of questions about that side of the family since we don't know much about them...I started asking these questions even before the ghostly activities started happening.  Strange stuff.<br><br>

Hmmm, bet the people that found my blog searching for "Inside Christmas Decorating" and "4-H Sewing Project" were disappointed when they starting reading this page - I highly doubt my complaints about Christmas decorations and stories about 4-H were what they were searching for!<br /><br />Anyway, hope all of you reading this had a great Thanksgiving!  Mine was fun, but I can honestly say that I am sick of turkey and ham now!!  Other than eating, my family and I didn't do much.  Well, we did go shopping in the evening.  We hit Big Lots, K-Mart, and Meijer, and there were some good sales...and it wasn't near as chaotic as shopping the day after Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I didn't go shopping (and I didn't even drive close to a mall!) on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  Instead I decided to get some fresh air and walk around a few cemeteries and take pictures...yes, I know that doesn't seem like a very Christmas-y thing to do!  I had a fun time though, so that's what matters. :)<br /><br />The first place I went was the old TICO cemetery.  I first read about the TICO Cemetery on Andy's <a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com">Forgotten Ohio</a> site.  I e-mailed him on Wednesday and he sent me directions.  You can see my pictures by <a href="tico.html">clicking here</a>, and you can see Andy's TICO page by <a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com/Asylum/tico.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />Since I was already on the West side, I also decided to visit Camp Chase Confederate Cemetery.  It's located on Sullivant Ave, just past Hague Ave when driving from downtown.  I had read about it online, and I remembered hearing about it in a high school history class.  You can see the photos I took there by <a href="chase.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />And finally, the third cemetery I visited was Greenlawn Cemetery.  I spent a little over an hour walking/driving around, it's gigantic!  And it's very, very easy to get lost in it :)  I haven't scanned all of the pictures I took yet, but you can <a href="greenlawn.html">click here</a> to see the ones I did scan.  Also, Andy has a lot of really good pictures that he took at Greenlawn on his site, <a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com/Greenlawn/greenlawn.html">click here</a> to see it.<br /><br />I also put a new page with a few old postcards on the site...I plan to add a link to this page on my <a href="antiques.html">antique collecting</a> page.  I'd eventually like to get all of the postcards with city scenes out here, but that may take a year to do!  So far I have the postcards with Columbus scenes scanned, <a href="pcards.html">click here</a> to see them.<br /><br />Yesterday my parents and I went to another estate auction.  People were bidding really high (like paying $27.50 for a depression glass saucer that has a book price of $4.00), but I did get a cool oil lamp and a miniture oil lamp for under book value.  We didn't stay for the whole auction though, it was freezing outside!  And it was also really windy, which made the cold even worse.  <br /><br />The long weekend is almost over, which means it'll be time for another week of work.  Hopefully the week will go fast...this coming weekend is the psychic party!  I'll make sure to write about the stuff the medium says about my haunted apartment!<br><br>
