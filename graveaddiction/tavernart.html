LANCASTER -- Sometimes feature articles are prompted by unexpected events or circumstances. 
<br><br>
In this case, the recently published book &quot;Haunted Ohio V&quot; by Chris Woodyard arrived last week at the Fairfield County District Library. 
<br><br>
Upon first opening of the book, it began a segment entitled &quot;The Devil Drinks Bud Lite,&quot; a story of alleged paranormal activity at Hawk's Tavern at the Mill, 431 S. Columbus St. 
<br><br>
The book alleges at least three paranormal entities possibly inhabit the structure. One is a clerk-type entity that is allegedly in the mill's former office area. 
<br><br>
A second is an older man who wears a dark (possibly brown) sports coat, approaches in full form to customers and initiates a conversation with them. It's a friendly conversation until the man turns personal, then irritated, when his advice is not taken by the customer. 
<br><br>
The third alleged entity, and possibly the one most experienced in making its presence known, is a woman in the building's basement. She reportedly wears a white dress of the 1890s-1920s vintage and is rather shy. The book's psychic thought she might have had blood stains on her clothing and has a tendency to stare at visitors. 
<br><br>
Current employees say they have seen or heard unusual happenings ranging from a rolling pool table cue ball to extinguished table lamps relighting themselves. 
<br><br>
&quot;I've always been told there were two to three (paranormal entities) here, but could have as many as seven,&quot; said Dustin Alvis, tavern manager. &quot;Sometimes, I see 'fireworks'-type effects or 'smoke spots' on our video tape (from security cameras). Some employees have seen unusual things out of the corner of their eye.&quot; 
<br><br>
&quot;I've seen the form of a woman out of the corner of my eye as she passed through a doorway,&quot; said Kim Ream, a tavern employee who has researched some of the building's history. 
<br><br>
The building site could have the heritage of possible paranormal activity, as its roots can be traced back approximately 200 years. 
<br><br>
City records, according to historian Charles Goslin, show the building site was part of the Emanuel Carpenter Jr. Addition, purchased from the Zane family for $6,784.28, and laid out in 1814. The addition consisted of 437 acres of 110 lots and was also known as Carpentertown. 
<br><br>
A Nov. 21, 1970, Eagle-Gazette history column by Charles Goslin claims the current tavern site was sold by Carpenter at a cost of 3,324 gallons of whiskey from George Ring and James Rice in 1817. 
<br><br>
Carpenter died in 1818 and his addition's circular pattern was designed to become Lancaster's downtown district but failed to materialize with the arrival of railroads to the city in the 1850s. 
<br><br>
An 1891 city directory lists the site as the possible location for the (Thomas and John) Benadum Brothers coal supply firm. 
<br><br>
An 1915 city directory has the site as location for the Continental Supply Co. grease and oil business. 
<br><br>
City directories from the mid-1940s do not list specific firms, but several area oil companies are listed as having operations in that area in the 1940s and early 1950s. 
<br><br>
Around 1975, it was home to Eggs & Stuff dairy store and also in various years housed such assorted businesses as Brill's bakery, Messingers Produce, Fish-N-Chicks, Old Mill Market and Tipp's rent-a-car during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. 
<br><br>
The site was purchased by current owner Ron Hawk in the late 1990s for his present Tavern at the Mill. 
<br><br>
So what happens on a random short night's stay in the building? 
<br><br>
The writer of this article, along with local photographer Judy Smith, Alvis and some employees stayed in the building after closing hours last Saturday for a short-length unscientific investigation. 
<br><br>
With the lights out, it's old stone and brick walls can leave a impression of ghostly heritage. Yet, after two and one-half hours which included attempts to talk to the reported entities in the dark, there was no response -- unless you include a possible "cold spot" located in the basement.
