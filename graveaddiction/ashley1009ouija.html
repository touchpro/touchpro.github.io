On October 28, 2009 I received an e-mail from Ashley about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hello, my name is Ashley and I'm 18.  Here is my experience with a Ouija board.
<br><br>
My mom had told me about her experience with a Ouija board when she was my age, and she said it told them to f*** off and blew out their candles.  But I was needing a little more proof.  Me, a coworker, and two other friends got out a Ouija board and decided to try and talk to some spirits.  Before we started, I made sure to read the do's and dont's.  Then we finally got started.  This happened early this year, and I don't remeber the exact conversations, but we started out talking to some random spirts.  We never asked if they were evil or not, and then we got one that was very startling.  I don't remember its exact replies, but this is the freaky part...we asked how old it was, and it replied with I think 96.  We asked how it died, and it said heart attack.  We asked the spirit what its name was, and it replied Cearel.  Now myself and one of the friends I was with had no idea about this name, but my coworker and the other friend knew exactly who it was.  They had known a man, who was really close to one of them, whose name was Cearel, who had just passed away from a heart attack at 96.  So those two decided to ask it more questions that only he would have known, and he answered them all correctly. After awhile we closed the board and put it away, and my first thought was that one of them had to be moving it.  However, the look on my friend's face was not one of joking.  She was very spooked by this and hasn't touched the board since.  I recently purchased one, and me and another friend are going to use it this weekend.  I'm excited, but I've been researching all this week about what not to do and what to do, and if anyone else has any tips I'd be glad to hear them!

<br><br><br>

If you have anny advice for Ashley, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on.
