On April 8, 2009 I received an e-mail from Denise about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Back in September I moveed in with my friend, Nina. She had told me her stories about the ouija board, but I didn't believe most of it because she always told me it's just a game. Well, I was very familar with the spirit that came though on this ouija board, because every time someone played on this board since the first night me and my friend Ashley got someone to talk to us, a spirit we called y because his favorite two letters to randomly place in  words where y, q, and z. He was always a nice spirit, except one night we started trying to get him to interact with us through the candles near the ouija board. We would tell him to flicker just one candle, and he did to the one we pointed at. We did this for like 30 minutes. Then my best friend, Ashley, had a dream that her grandfather who had recently died not many years ago told her not to touch the board ever again. She listened, of course, but the curious person I am continued trying to figure the board out.
<br><br>
One weekend me and a group of my friends decided to play with the ouija board since they never have. I told them it was real, because I had seen my friend's fingers come off the little planchette when it was still moving. Even though I had no proof the ouija board could tell me the future, I some reason believe in it for the fact that one night it told me my guardian angel was some man with the intials of wbd.  Come to find out later on those were my mother's father's intials. He had died when I was a little girl. Well, that night me and like 7 other people sat down and turned all the lights out in the house except for the 3 candles we had around the board.
<br><br>
We began asking who the spirit was, and this time the spirit gave us a different name than those other times. We just asked questions about the spirit until he gave us permission to ask about us. The spirit began to scare us by saying someone was going to die by an axe. We asked who, and it said kayla.  Then it said mom. We soon realized the spirit was just joking with us when he said h-a-h-a. Then I started laughing because I realized it was really Y. I asked him if it was Y. He said yes. Then I began asking questions that only I would know the answers to.  He began giving his life story, just as he did the nights I had played it before. He said he was a Native American who had died and gone to hell because of his beliefs, and his wife was there because of her's. He said hated her because all there is is hate where in hell. He said he had two children, and they both went to heaven because they were too young to understand. They all died of a disease that broke out. We asked where is he from modern day today, and he said the town we were in. One of my friends asked what neighborhood, and he named my neighborhood.  Another asked around what street, and he then spelled out my street name. I was creeped out because no one in that room knew where I lived except me and one other person, and both of us sat out and took down the letters. I was amazed that he told them everything he had told me.
<br><br>
We then began asking personal questions about our lives. He said stuff to one of the girls about her mom: that she should say sorry.  Come to find out that Kayla and her mom had a huge fight a few weeks earlier. Y keep amazing us with stuff we only knew about ourselves. The whole night I was just watching and taking notes. He then started asking me to play, so I did. He told me that I would conceive on February 13, 2009, and that I would  tell the father on his birthday. He also said that my baby would be premature, and it would be boy. He also said who my baby's father would be. I didn't believe it because the guy Y said hates me. Wes was my first love, but we had so much drama and chaos between us that he hates me with everything in him. Well, February 13th rolled around. My ex was still hating me. But the next day I was going to visit my friend Josh who lives six hours away. When I was almost there, I found out my ex would be going to, to also see Josh. My ex ended up following me around all night like a little puppy, love sick. That night my ex and I ended up hooking up. The next morning my ex got up, kissed me on my forehead, and left.
<br><br>
After that day he went back to hating me. I left for basic combat training 3 days later. Got there and passed 3 different blood tests, and a pregnancy test. On March 5 I found out I was pregnant, and I knew exactly who my baby belonged to. There was no way it was anyone else's. I was shocked there were two things the ouija board told me that were true: I would get pregnant, and that my ex would be the father. I was shocked. I wasn't allowed to call home to tell my ex I was pregnant until March 8th, the day after his birthday! The ouija board was only one day off each time. Then I found out that I would be due November 6th. I am currently 9 weeks and 1 day pregnant. I was told my baby, if born on September 5th, he/she would survive. Right now the only thing I'm not sure the ouija board is correct about is if it's a boy, and if my baby will be premature. But from my own ouija board experience, it's real. I didn't really believe until this.
<br><br>
I'll let y'all know if my baby is a boy, and when I actually have my baby.
