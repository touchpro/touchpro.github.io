On March 14, 2006 I received an e-mail from Brianne about another interesting ouija board experience she had:
<br><br><br>
&quot;If you read my story <a href="smdixouija.html">I'm Now A Spirit</a>, then you see that a spirit poses as my cousin's little sister. The next time my cousin and I decided to play, we found out that the spirit who was pretending to be my cousin's sister was actually a spirit by the name of GT.  He kept messing up our conversation with Dug Hole.  We kept on trying to get him away, but he'd say NO.  Then he said that he was my spirit guide, that he was evil, and for me to give him my soul.  I'm kind of a dare-devil, so I said, &quot;Why should I give you my soul?&quot;  He replied BECAUSE IM EVIL. We stopped the session right then and there, but later when we tried to talk to Dug, GT kept coming back.  Everyone we talked to that night would spell out HE IS HERE, meaning that GT was back.
<br><br>
Now, when we talk to GT he is pretty nice, except for the fact that he lies to us a lot.  He loves to pretend to be SES, RER, or he'll just spell out 27 over and over again.  He also still says that he is evil. I have another story about him:
<br><br>
My friends got bored, so we made an ouija board out of paper.  We started it up, and guess who came through--GT.  Turns out that he is my friend's spirit guide, so he said GIVE ME YOUR SOUL to her. She is a big chicken, so she ran screaming. To this day she won't play with an ouija board in the dark because GT said that he was going to eat her.&quot;
