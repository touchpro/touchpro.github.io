On February 9, 2007 I received an e-mail from Van Helsing about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I wanted evidence of the supernatural or existance of God as I was a skeptic. So I decided that holding a ouija seance was best to start.
<br><br>
In December 2006 after midnight I began the seance.
<br><br>
I first started to light some candles and turned off the lights. I then started saying out aloud is there anyone here that would like to get in touch. I got no reply and kept repeating myself. Then finally I asked is anyone here...the planchette moved to yes. This really freaked me out. I had mixed emotions; I was afraid but also happy to get a response (this made me a believer). Once I'd gotten myself together I asked another question, what is your name. The planchette moved to J then O, then went to the middle of the board. Then the planchette started to move left and right. This was freaking me out a bit, then the board went to goodbye. I asked if there was anyone else wanting to speak and the board kept going to goodbye. Then it would go to the middle of the board moving in randon directions. Finally the board went to goodbye and I ended the session.
<br><br>
I was tired and decided to try get some sleep.  After 10 minutes of having the light off I felt as if something was with me...I got goosebumps. Then I began to here little noises like knocks or tappings. I got up, switched on the light and left it on. This continued for a week until I decided it was enough and stayed over with friends. Once I returned home everything was back to normal. The haunting or whatever it was, was nothing visual, just interferance with electricals and knockings. The feeling that something bad was with me was the most frightening. I'll never do a ouija seance alone again.
