What a day!  I'm working from home (I'm on my lunch break right now) because we got a <b>bunch</b> of snow last night, and my website was down for about 2 hours this morning.  But now the site is back up, and working from home really isn't that bad.  I'm glad I have that option...yeah, I could have made it in this morning as long as I allowed plenty of extra time, but why risk the roads when I don't have to?!<br /><br />Anyway, here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://mmadness.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Monday Madness</a>...I love these fill in the blank ones!<br /><ol><br /><li>The one kitchen appliance I just could not live without is my <u>microwave</u> (I almost said my iced tea maker, but I could always use the teapot if something happened to it).<br><br><br /><li>My desk always looks like <u>it was hit by a tornado</u>.<br><br><br /><li>The clocks in my house are always <u>a few</u> minutes fast (All of the clocks in my house display a different time, unintentionally.  The only clock I set 20 minutes fast on purpose is my bedroom alarm clock).<br><br> <br /><li>The one television program I just can't stand is <u>Trading Spaces</u> (I don't watch TV, but my parents and sister always watch it, and I think it's terribly boring).<br><br><br /><li>The one television program I try to never miss is <u>the 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 News on <a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com" target="_blank">NBC4</a></u>.<br><br><br /><li>When it comes to housework, I really hate cleaning <u>fishtank</u> (It's a 30 gallon tank, it takes forever!).<br><br><br /><li>If I could re-design my living room, the first thing I would do is <u>make sure all the wood matched</u> (Right now the bookshelf, coffee table, end tables, TV stand, etc are two different shades).<br><br><br /><li>I wish I had a bigger <u>kitchen</u> in my house (The kitchen in my apartment is tiny, but not as bad as some of my friends' kitchens).<br><br><br /><li>When someone points a camera at me and says 'Smile!' I usually <u>hide or start swearing</u> (I've <b>always</b> hated having my picture taken...maybe I'm a vampire?!).<br><br><br /><li>I expect I'll have my income tax done by <u>the end of next week</u> (I like getting it done early).<br /></ol><br /><br /><br /><br><br>

These past few days have been really busy.  I went to the second Fisher Catholic High School Alumni Association Core Committee meeting on Monday night.  Like the last meeting, I had a lot of fun.  And I have A LOT of work to do for the next newsletter!! I need to have the newsletter finished by March 1 so we can get it mailed out by the end of the month.  <br /><br />Tuesday night I went to a couple cemeteries, which I have already added to the site.  If you're interested, you can see the links to the new pages by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>.  Then I went home and started to clean house, but I didn't finish.<br /><br />Wednesday night I finished cleaning house.  I also cleaned the fishtank and did my laundry.  Oh yeah, and that's the night I updated the website.  It was a long day!<br /><br />I didn't do anything tonight, it was nice :)  My day at work was really busy though.  We had a team breakfast at Der Dutchman....mmmmmmm, breakfast bar!  It was an OK breakfast, except for one of my coworkers saying something about snot running out of her son's nose like a faucet.  That was a pretty disgusting thing to hear while you're eating, and she's always so loud when she talks about stuff like that.  You know, that's one more good thing about leaving this area (only 6 more days until the move!!!!!), I won't have to hear anymore of her gross stories!  <br /><br />I met my friends Laurie and Julie for lunch yesterday, that was really fun (much better than the breakfast).  I worked with them about 4 years ago in Life Systems.  I always enjoy lunches with them because I always hear a lot of good gossip!  <br /><br />And that's pretty much what I've been up to.  It doesn't seem like I've been that busy when I write about it, but I really was!  Anyway, hopefully things will settle down and I can get back to blogging daily.  But right now I'm tired, so I'm going to call it a night!<br><br>

Just wanted to let you all know that yes, I am still alive :)  I've just been EXTREMELY busy this week and haven't had a chance to blog.  I should have plenty of time tonight though, so I'll be sure to fill you in on everything that's been going on!<br /><br /><br><br>

My answers to today's <a href="http://mmadness.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Monday Madness</a>:<br /><br /><b>True or False:</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>I often wake up before my alarm clock goes off. </b><br><br>True - Unfortunately I'm always up at least fifteen minutes before the alarm goes off.  And on most weekends I'm up when my alarm usually goes off during the week, even though it isn't set.  At least I'm usually able to fall asleep again after waking up!<br><br><br /><li><b>I love to drive; in any kind of weather!</b><br><br>False - I do love driving, but not on ice!<br><br><br /><li><b>I'd rather have to worry about staying warm than staying cool.</b><br><br>True - I hate being hot, I'd much rather live someplace cool than someplace hot.<br><br><br /><li><b>I wish I lived in another state.</b><br><br>False - Yeah, every now and then I think it'd be cool to live in a different state, but Ohio really isn't a bad state to live in.  There's a lot of historical places to explore, and the climate isn't too bad.<br><br><br /><li><b>Multi-tasking is what I do best!</b><br><br>False?  I'm not sure if I'm a good multi-tasker or not.  I do know that I agree with <a href="http://bluethrill.net/blog" target="_blank">Dave</a> - &quot;multi-tasking&quot; is an annoying, overused term!!<br><br><br /><li><b>Flying is the only way to go!</b><br><br>False - I don't mind flying, but I think I like driving better.

Today was another good day at work.  I'll really be surprised if I have any bad days during these remaining days in my current area, because just knowing that I only have eleven days left there is enough to keep me happy :)  I did do some real work today, but a big chunk of my day was responding to &quot;congratulation&quot; notes and deciding where to go for the going away lunch my coworker Brenda was nice enough to set up.  I think tomorrow will be just as much fun.<br /><br />I'm excited about work next week too.  I can't remember which day (it's on my work calendar), but sometime next week I'm having lunch with a couple of my old coworkers (I worked with them when I first started at the company) who I haven't seen for a few months.  Well, I've seen Julie around the building, but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her.  Laurie works in a different building (the company has several) so I never see her.  It'll be fun to catch up on all of the gossip :)  Also, I'm meeting up after work on Wednesday with a couple other old coworkers, Amanda and Davis, for happy hour.  Amanda just recently left her area too, so it'll be interesting to see how her new job is going.  I haven't seen Davis for almost a year, he's always a lot of fun.  He's the person who planned <a href="nerdprom.html">Nerd Prom 2000</a> with me!!  Davis and I worked together about four years ago.  We didn't really like the area we were in, so we had to find ways to entertain and amuse ourselves to make it through the days.  We did thinks like kidnap pig-shaped stress balls and leave ransom notes, etc.  And we also adopted a daughter.  We named her Sheboygan - I'll post a photo below:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/sheboygan.jpg"></center><br /><br />Yeah, she may not be the prettiest little girl, but we loved her anyway!  And yes, we did waste a lot of time while working in that area :)  I still have Sheboygan on my desk, maybe I'll give her back to Davis next week!<br /><br />Well, my sister got home from class a few minutes ago.  I think I'll go and talk to her now, it's rude to ignore her and keep blogging!<br /><br><br>

Today was a wonderful, fantastic, terrific, fabulous, splendid, GREAT day at work.  Doesn't sound like something I'd normally say, does it?!  Well, I'm sure the regular readers can guess why it was such a great day...<br /><br /><b>I RECEIVED A JOB OFFER FOR THE AUTOMATED TESTING POSITION IN LIFE SYSTEMS!!!!!!!!!</b><br /><br />My current manager told me yesterday afternoon, but I didn't want to blog about it until I got the official offer.  My manager came over to my desk before the team meeting yesterday and asked if I had heard anything about the job yet.  He asked this almost daily so I thought nothing of it.  I told him that no, I hadn't heard anything and at the rate it was going I probably wouldn't hear anything for five weeks.  Yeah, I was being a bit dramatic :)  Anyway, he then told me that he had a feeling I'd hear something much sooner.  I gave him a look that said &quot;sure, whatever&quot;.  Then he told me that he got a call from the hiring manager that morning to let him know that they were planning to offer me the job.  I tried not to smile and act too happy, but I couldn't help it!  Anyway, then it was time to go to the team meeting.  After the team meeting was over I asked him if they had discussed any possible start dates, but he said they didn't since I hadn't accepted it yet.<br /><br />I waited impatiently all afternoon yesterday, but I didn't receive any calls from the hiring manager or HR.  When I got into work this morning the red voicemail light on my phone was on.  I checked it, and there was a message from the hiring manager.  He called about an hour after I left yesterday, and he called to offer me the job!!  I called him back this morning and accepted the offer :)  He talked with my current manager, and by this afternoon I had my release date - my last day in the area is January 30, I'll start the new job on February 2, Groundhog Day!  He sent out an announcement to the team, so most of my afternoon was spent talking to my coworkers, explaining why I chose to leave, etc.   <br /><br />I have another Alumni Association Core Committee meeting on Monday.  I've really been having a lot of fun with this high school alumni committee stuff!  As a result of the alumni section of my high school's website, I've heard from a few people I hadn't talked to since I graduated in 1997.  It's always fun to hear from people you haven't  heard from in ages!<br /><br />Well, I can't think of much else to write about...all of my thoughts are focused on the job change.   I'll try to write about other stuff tomorrow :)<br><br>

I had to run to the grocery store to buy bread so I could pack my lunch for tomorrow.  I can't stand going to the grocery store, and tonight was no exception.  Actually, the actual shopping part was better than normal, probably because I only bought one item :)  But the parking lot was a mess, it was packed.  So why do people decide to park like idiots when it's crowded?  I saw plenty of cars taking up a space and a half.  And when I finally found a spot, some person in a Cavalier didn't pull up far enough and they were about half way into the spot I wanted.  If I drove a small car too that would be no problem, but cramming a pickup into a spot like that just doesn't work.  So I drove around some more and finally found a decent parking spot.<br /><br />Other than the grocery store adventure, I had another uneventful night.  My day at work wasn't too bad though.  This afternoon my manager told me something that made me think I'll get a call from HR about the job I applied for really soon.  That would make my week wonderful!  And if I do get this new job I'll be a much happier person, and that should be reflected here in the blog entries too.  Sometimes I worry that the few people who actually read this must think I'm a super negative person that just complains about everything.  Honestly, I'm not usually like that!<br><br>

Saturday I bought a new CD, Shinedown - <i>"Leave a Whisper"</i>.  I had only heard two songs from the CD, "Fly From the Inside" and "45".  I liked both, but I wasn't sure what the rest of the CD would be like...let me tell you, it's awesome!  It's one of the best CDs I've purchased lately!  I can honestly say I enjoy listening to each song.  I really like "45", but I always think of my coworker Lina.  Lina sits next to me, and she bursts into song periodically throughout the day.  And one of her favorite songs right now is "45".  However, Lina doesn't quite sound like Shinedown when she sings it.  Like our coworker Joe says, every song she sings sounds a lot like a cover by Pat Benetar :)  I can't think of a better way to describe it, I agree with him totally!  <br /><br />Today was a rather uneventful day.  Nothing even remotely interesting happened.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's better than having a bunch of stressful things happen!<br><br>

No <a href="http://www.bluethrill.net/blog" target="_blank">Dave</a>, in response to your comment to my last blog entry, I didn't have anything happier to write about on Friday.  But it wasn't a terrible day.<br /><br />My friend <a href="carpasture.html">Mark</a> has been really sick lately, so I was surprised when my phone rang on Friday afternoon at work and his name popped up on the caller ID.  I wasn't expecting him to be back at work yet.  Anyway, since he knows a lot about car problems I told him about my adventure with the ABS.  He told me there was no way it would cost less than $1000 to fix.  I told him that he could be wrong, maybe it'd end up being something easy to fix - like something being stuck or something.  He told me to call him back as soon as I heard from the people at Procare and tell him that he was right.  <br /><br />Well, I called Procare shortly after I got off the phone with him.  The guy I talked to was much more helpful than the one I talked with when I dropped the truck off.  He told me there was good news and bad news.  The bad news was that they figured out the problem was with some motor inside this valve in the ABS system.  The part would have to be special ordered, it probably wouldn't be here for at least two days and it would be about $769.00.  With labor and everything the estimate was about $1146.50.  And to make it worse, they could find other things wrong with the ABS after fixing this valve, so it could be much more.  So what's the good news?  The good news is that they took out the fuse for the ABS, so I could drive the truck without the ABS until I decided when and if I wanted to fix it.  My brakes work fine, I just don't have ABS.  So for now I'm going to drive it without the ABS - the first three cars I had didn't have it, I'll be fine.  <br /><br />Then I knew what else I had to do - I had to call Mark back and tell him that he was right...I hate it when I have to tell him he's right :)  But he usually is about car stuff.  At least he didn't give me too hard of a time about being wrong!<br /><br />After picking the truck up on Friday I didn't do much else.  I spent Friday night playing around with the site.  A couple people had told me that the photo pages I have with the photos in the dropdown boxes didn't work with Netscape 6+ or Mozilla.  I figured out what I needed to do to fix the problem, and now it's all fixed!<br /><br />Yesterday I went down to my parents' house.  I played with Oscar, Sammie, and Max (the wiener dogs).  They get so excited when I visit, I think it's only because I go a bit crazy with the treats and they know they can count on me to give them lots.  We went to lunch and did some shopping.  Later that evening I went to the hospital with my mom to visit one of her friends from high school.  Her friend checked into the hospital on Friday.  She had been feeling dizzy and extremely tired.  Her doctor did some tests and found out she had Type II Diabetes.   They were amazed she was still conscious, her blood sugar level was 760!!!!!!  I guess normal is around 100.  She seems to be doing better, but she'll be in the hospital for a few more days.  They think the main cause of her drastic blood sugar increase is simply age.     It's scary how stuff like that can happen so quickly.  <br /><br />Today I've just done stuff around the house.   Sundays are always depressing, because it means the weekend is over...and that means back to work :(  I know I said it last weekend, but maybe this week will be my lucky week and I'll hear something about the new job.<br /><br />That's about it for today...Hope you all had a great weekend!<br /><br><br>

What a great way to start the day...<br /><br />I wake up and get ready for work, it seems like a normal day.  I go outside and get in the truck.  I start it up, and all the lights (engine, brakes, ABS, battery, etc) flash like normal and go out.  I put the truck in reverse to back out of the parking spot and the ABS kicks on.  I thought maybe the snow on the ground caused it, so I didn't think much of it.  Well, it stayed on after a couple minutes so I decided to go home and see if I could figure out what was wrong.  I turned off the car, took out the key even and the ABS was STILL running!  And it's about 5:45AM.  Most repair shops don't open until 8:00AM, so I was really freaking out about what to do - I didn't think it would be good to let the truck sit outside until 8 and have the ABS run (or pump, whatever you call it).  I called my mom's work number and left a message to have her call me as soon as she got in.  It probably worried her to hear that.  Anyway, I just wanted her to call so I knew my parents made it into work, then I got off the phone with her and called my dad.  I told him what was wrong, I told him everything I had tried to get it to shut off (pressing the brake pedal with the truck on and off, starting it again, etc).  He couldn't think of anything else I could try.  I looked through the yellow pages and saw Procare was open at 7AM, and there was a shop not too far from me.  So I took it over.  <br /><br />Now I've NEVER been one of those people who complain about being treated unfairly just because I'm a female.  That has never kept me from promotions, etc.  However, I did feel that I got pretty crappy service this morning at Procare, all because I'm female.  The guy pretty much told me that they probably wouldn't get a chance to look at it until this afternoon, and he'd call me.  I asked if he really thought it would be OK to let the truck sit out there with the ABS running until this afternoon, and he said they couldn't do anything.  So when my dad got there to pick me up I had him go in and ask the manager again.  He still wasn't overly helpful, but he did tell my dad that they would temporarily shut off the ABS once a mechanic got in.  So why couldn't he tell me that???????  Ugh, I hate car problems.  I can't complain too much though.  Other than tire problems and getting the bumper fixed after some guy hit me 3 years ago, this is the first time I've had to take Chuck the Truck in for maintenance, even though I have had him for almost 5 years.  Not too bad - and it just shows that Chevy Trucks really are &quot;like a rock&quot;! :)<br /><br />Well, I better be getting back to work since I was already in late.  Hopefully I'll have happier things to blog about the rest of the day!<br><br>

Well, for the most part my site seems to be working.  There's only a couple things that aren't working, but all the major stuff is functioning correctly.  I'm still receiving tons of e-mail, they said I may not receive all of the messages that were being held for another day or two.  And there's probably going to be some e-mail that was lost.  Oh well, if it was important I'm sure the person will resend it.<br /><br />Nothing too major has happened in the apartment lately...just the normal stuff being moved around, hearing whistling, etc.  My sister is staying with me tonight (since she didn't feel like driving at least 40 minutes after she got out of class to get back to my parents house where she lives)...I'm anxious to see if she sees or hears anything.  She usually does, and it really bothers her.  <br /><br />My friend Kate came over last night.  After we satisfied our desire for Mexican food at Baja Fresh, we came back to my place to use the Ouija board.  It was pretty interesting, I have the &quot;transcript&quot; added to the Ouija Stories section of the site.  You can see it by <a href="ouija012004.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />I think they're getting closer to making a decision about the job I applied for.  Tuesday afternoon I got an e-mail from the hiring manager asking for my current salary, that's always a good sign.  And today while I was eating lunch with my parents in the cafeteria, the other manager (the one who told me about the job) came over and asked if Jeff had talked to me yet.  Interesting...I'm guessing I may hear something as early as next week.  I'd just love to know one way or the other.  Because if I don't get this one I'm going to start looking again.  Some of the stuff that happens in my current area really gives me headaches.  I take <b>a lot</b> of Advil Migraine just so I can make it through the day! :)<br /><br />Even though I wouldn't have been able to publish my blog entries to the site, I still should have typed them up.  I know I had other stuff to talk about, but I really can't think of anything right now.  Maybe I'll remember tomorrow.  Therefore, I'll just wait and blog again tomorrow!<br><br>

As some of you may have noticed, my site has been up and down (mostly down) these past two days.  My webhosting company told me they are upgrading the server.  Everything was supposed to be working correctly by the end of today, but I'm not getting my hopes up.  I'm still having a lot of issues with the MySQL databases for the guestbook and message board...I can't log into phpMyAdmin to work on them.  I'm also unable to access my mailing list manager (I have this awful feeling that my mailing list will be gone when I finally am able to log in, which means I'll have to start from scratch!).  I am thankful that FTP is finally working again, at least I can update the blog :)<br /><br />However, since the site is still having issues, I'm going to keep this short...even though I have lots I'd like to blog about.  I promise I'll blog about it all once things are stable and working correctly again...which better be soon!<br><br>

Seems I'm back to being bad about blogging regularly again, doesn't it?!  I'll try to be better this week!<br /><br />My weekend wasn't much fun.  It was time for the quarter end QC at work again.  We were told we'd probably be able to start QCing the statements around noon on Friday...then that time was moved to 7:30PM...then it changed to midnight...then it changed to 2AM...and finally I got the call to come into work at 5:48AM Saturday morning.  I was able to sleep in until 7:30 on Friday, and then I worked from home.  I tried to sleep periodically throughout the day/night on Friday so I would be rested up to go into work, but not knowing when I'd get the call was enough to keep me from falling asleep :(  So needless to say, I was exhausted by the time we finished QCing at 2PM yesterday afternoon.  But I had my second wind or something, because I couldn't fall asleep when I got home.  So I ended up driving down to my parents' house for dinner.  I finally fell asleep around midnight last night, and slept until 12:10PM this afternoon :)  It's been a LONG time since I've slept in that late...actually, I probably haven't done that since last quarter end!<br /><br />It's been a few months since I've written about this, but the strange things in my apartment have been happening again lately, the haunting stuff...and they've been happening VERY frequently!  Furniture in the computer/frog room has been moved into different rooms, the silverware has been taken out of the drawer and lined up on the kitchen counter again, things have been moved off the coffee table to different spots around the apartment, etc.  And while that's strange (and scary!), it's the same stuff that's been happening for the past year.  But I've been hearing a lot of things lately too, which isn't very common.  For example, about an hour or so after I woke up this morning I heard a winding sound, like the sound of someone winding a watch.  I looked outside, there was nothing out there that would cause the sound.  Besides, my window was shut, and the sound definitely seemed to be coming from my room.  I walked around the apartment, and I heard the sound in every room.  But it sounded the same in each room, it didn't get louder or softer.  I finally walked back into my bedroom, and this old watch I found at my great uncle's house was laying on my bed.  I keep this watch inside a jewelry box, in a different room.  I hadn't looked inside that jewelry box for at least a month or two.  When I picked the watch up off my bed, I noticed it was ticking, and it was set to the correct time.  OK, I knew this watch still worked, but it's a really old one that you have to wind.  But I hadn't wound it for probably a year, and I never set it.  So I have no idea how a) it got into my room, b) how it was ticking, or c) how it was set to the correct time.  It scared me to death, it's definitely not a good way to start the morning!!  I did bring a couple new photos home with me from my mom's house last weekend (she found them in my great uncle's house a couple years ago).  I framed the two pictures and hung them up Friday night, I wonder if that is why the paranormal activity has been crazy again?  We don't know who the two men are (and we probably never will since the last person who might have known was my great uncle), but we're guessing they are relatives.  I didn't scan the photos before I framed them, but here's a photo of the photos (it's not very clear since the glass kept picking up reflections):<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/oldpic.jpg"></center><br /><br />I think it's DEFINITELY time to have my friends over for a ouija party again!  Even though you can't trust anything the board spells out, it'd still be fun to see what it spells out about the stuff going on at my house!<br /><br />I can't believe the weekend is almost over and it's time to go back to work.  I'm hoping I'll hear something about the job I applied for sometime this week!  I'll be sure to blog about it, whether or do or don't get it!<br><br>
