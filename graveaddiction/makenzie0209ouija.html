On February 28, 2009 I received an e-mail from Makenzie B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is a real session, and it really spooked my sister and I. Now that I look back at it, it seems a little ridiculous that we kept talking to this &quot;demon&quot; for so long.
<br><br>
February 17, 2009<br>
12:08 AM - 2:01 AM<br>
<br><br>
Me: Are there any spirits who want to talk right now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sister: Are you sure that nobody wants to speak now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sister: So, is there anyone who wants to speak with us right now?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ugh, why does the board like you better? Anyways, can you tell us your name?<br>
Board: Grego1ry<br>
<br>
Me: What? Wait...is your name is Gregory?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sister: What's your--<br>
<br>
Me: Wait, I have a better one. Why does the board like Angela better than me?<br>
Board: Fgfgf<br>
<br>
Me: See? You like her more, right?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sister: Ha. Anyways, where do you come from?<br>
Board: Hel (we stopped the planchette)<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, so we know that you're a nice friendly visitor from Hell, why are you here?<br>
Board: You<br>
<br>
Me: Really! Are you here because of me?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What the heck did I do?<br>
Board: Board open<br>
<br>
Me: I left the board... shizz. Awww shizz. I left the board open last night.<br>
Sister: What? Are you serious?<br>
Me: I was half asleep!<br>
Sister: Well you shouldn't be USING the board when you're half asleep!<br>
Me: Well we probably shouldn't be using the board in general! Didn't you learn ANYTHING from The Exorcist?<br>
Sister: That piece of shit? That's not even nearly...<br>
Me: Shut up! It's moving!<br>
<br>
Board: Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop....<br>
<br>
Sister: (stops the planchette) Ok, do you have to tell us anything?<br>
Board: Im here<br>
<br>
Me: You expect us to believe that you're here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sister: Erm, goodbye!<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
I don't belive that was a real demon, but strange things HAVE been happening around the house: like TV turning on by itself, radio turning on by itself, lights flickering every once in a whie, but nothing destructive. Honestly, if it was a real demon, I don't think that it would waste it's time by turning the television on. :)
