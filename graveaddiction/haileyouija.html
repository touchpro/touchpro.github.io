On July 3, 2005 I received an e-mail from Hailey Fischer about her very scary ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;It was about three weeks ago that I went to my boyfriend's house. Me, my boyfriend, Mikey, Alex, and Ryan all gathered there. It was a little after 11 P.M. and we decided we wanted to play with the Ouija board. We had lit 2 candles. We lit a black and white one. We all sat down, but only Brendan (my boyfriend) and I played. Ryan, Mikey, and Alex were watching. 
<br><br>
It was all going well and we were getting clear answers. We would ask questions such as &quot;How did you die?&quot; or &quot;What is your name?&quot;. I guess these are not questions you're supposed to ask. Well anyway, we kept going at it and being stupid because we didn't believe that you could be harmed in any way from this such &quot;game&quot;.
<br><br>
Getting sick of the weird answers we were receiving, we decided to go and sit outside for a few minutes. We obviously blew out the candles and properly said goodbye. As we're all sitting outside, we heard some clashing in the house. I say &quot;Isn't everybody out of the house?&quot; We go and check it out. I was the first to enter and we walk back to the room where we had been playing and every candle in that room had been lit. I made Mikey and Ryan search the whole house top to bottom to make sure somebody wasn't playing some prank on us. They come back as me and Brendan search the room and they said no sign of anybody. So we're standing in this candle lit room wondering what the hell had happened. Suddenly I fall to the ground in pain. I'm screaming at the top of my lungs and on my left arm had appeared two burn marks. One in the shape of a C and the other in the shape of a zig-zag. It was at least a centimeter deep. I still have the scars today. We have no clue who, what, or why that happened. We think it may be a sign but since this has happened we never will touch the Ouija board again...&quot;
