On April 30, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kindra about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Since a child I had been told by my mother not to play with the board - not until my teen years did I ignore her request...then again, being a teenager you always go against whatever your parents say, right?
<br><br>
I had different, yet interesting, things happen to me when one day a couple friends of mine and I decided to play it at school, foolish I suppose...This was our first experience. Nothing happened right away which dissapointed us, but then it moved and we all freaked out thinking it was one of us.
<br><br>
We talked to one spirit in a supposed haunted room where even teachers thought they saw a ghost. We contacted a spirit named Araceli.  She was about thirteen when she died, and even died in the school too. She was nice, but would have a tendancy to lie for some reason. Later on that day, my friend asked a teacher if anyone ever died in our school.
<br><br>
Our teacher could only remember a recent death in the 1990's, and the girls name had been Araceli...creepy! We totally freaked but it made sense, she choked to death.
<br><br>
****************
<br><br>
We have talked to other spirits - some a bit rude, like one spirit who constantly said the f word and b word. A couple have creeped us out with their accurate answers and predictions, but also because they will spin the planchatte very fast, as well as hating us and wanting us to die. Usually we immediatly say goodbye if they say that.
<br><br>
Some, however, are very funny and are kind, good spirits I think (usually we contacted guy spirits, only about three or four girl spirits).
<br><br>
One spirit was nice and he made us laugh a lot, but he was kind of disturbing because he always mentioned something about sex in our sessions. Oh, I could go on with stories with him...Still, he was pretty caring. And willingly told us about his past. However, he watches us in the shower - yes, very creepy and perverted. I just hope he was lying about that!
<br><br>
Also, I am pretty sure that I have contacted my spirit guide.  Apparently I had been married to him in my last past life. He's very sweet, he never gets angry, and usually has his emotions stay in tact, but I have promised him never to play with the board again because it's too dangerous as he says. So that is why I no longer play with the board, and a pyschic told me the same thing. However, my spirit guide insists he will always be with me though and all his answers had been right.
<br><br>
Also, I think I have seen one of my spirit guides in my dream, as a shape-shifter.  Spirit guides can appear as shape shifters, coincidence?
<br><br>
Some freak things occuring over the several times when playing:
<br><br>
- When we had candles lit at my friend's basement, we asked the spirit we were speaking to make its present known. Within a couple seconds, one of the candles started flickering then changed ENTIRELY to blue, then went out. Later, when turning the lights on, the candle had been all scratched up! Weird!
<br><br>
- The second time, after playing the board, I had read about silver helping to protect against evil, so I wore a silver bracelet. When I woke up the next morning, my bracelet had been broken! Brand new and pure silver might I add! Apparently Ricky (he might be my other spirit guide), one of the first spirits I contacted, broke it because he likes my &quot;soul&quot; and me in general, plus he insists that it was an ugly bracelet. Shame, my mother bought that as a present for me. Also, I don't know if I really believe in the silver anymore, someone told me it's untrue.
<br><br>
- One night when trying to go to bed, I felt something brush against my hair and cheek. I opened my eyes, but I didn't say anything.  Then later I felt someone nudge me, I had trouble sleeping after that though. According to the board it was Ricky.
<br><br>
- Another time we contacted an old lady that use to live in my friend's house.  She didn't seem to like us that much (Not to be mean, but I noticed the male spirits always like us more than the female spirits for some reason, well except my own friend's spirit guide named Anna who is also pretty much truthful).  Anyway, when I asked the question I could've sworn I heard a lady's voice whisper no, then the planchette moved there. I freaked and asked the only one friend I was playing with at the time if she said anything. She blinked and shook her head, saying she hadn't heard anything. I later asked if I heard that spirit speak and the answer was yes. Yeah, that creeped me out for a while too.
<br><br>
- One night I thought I heard a man's voice say something like, &quot;So...&quot; but didn't finish, and then some footsteps...it couldn't have been my dad or brother because both were gone while my mom was asleep. It was this one spirit who likes me and was trying to speak to me or so the board said. I guess he knows I freak out too easily. And besides, I kind of think he lives in my house.
<br><br>
- A spirit who hated my one friend and was mad at her, broke her cell phone charm. Weird or maybe coincidence.
<br><br>
- I have been warned several times not to do any Wiccan spells in my house because the bad spirits would do something to me. Apparently I have 30 in my house - lucky me. I don't know...I haven't tried any spells yet, that was a bit weird for them to say.
<br><br>
- Some have lied to us, and sometimes when we ask where they go it is either Heaven or Hell. Uh--I'm not really sure about that one.
<br><br>
- A couple of my friends have had some strange dreams, thinking the spirits we contacted have appeared to them. I'm not sure but maybe...
<br><br>
But yeah the ouija board was usually accurate and fun, still it has to be taken seriously sometimes. I enjoyed it though.
