The last couple of weeks my wife and I have watched this show on TV called &quot;Blind Date&quot; and I have to say some of those people on there are the worst dates I have EVER seen. It's like a train wreck you just can't stop watching because you wanna see what ridiculous thing is going to happen next. They had one where the girl was totally wasted and another where the girl says &quot;I'm not sure you're hot enough for me&quot;. If anybody had ever said that to me when I was dating I would have smacked them upside the head. As a famous philosopher once said....&quot;if she's man enough to say that, she's man enough to get smacked&quot;....I think his name was Chris Rock or something like that. 
<br />

<br />
My wife told me some horror stories from when she was dating that I couldn't believe. I was apparently lucky back in the dating days. I never really ran into any idiots.</td>

I've never watched it, but it does sound interesting! 
<br />

<br />
My friend Mark has the absolute worst dating stories.  He does a lot of online dating through Match and eHarmony, and some of the people he has met are terrible.  He always shares the horror stories with us at work.  He's had so many I know I won't remember them all, but here are a couple highlights:
<br />

<br />
1.  He went to dinner with a girl near his home in Hilliard, things seemed to be going well with the conversation.  After dinner, they planned to go to Easton and see a show at the Funny Bone.  Mark offered to let her ride there with him, but she wanted to go home afterwards (she lived near Dayton) so she chose to just follow him over there.  Well, I guess parking was terrible that night, and they ended up getting separated.  But he called her cell phone and told her where to meet inside.  She said she would see him inside.  Well, turns out she decided she didn't really like him, so instead of parking she just drove home!  He e-mailed her later that night, and she said she just didn't feel a &quot;spark&quot; or connection so she didn't want to waste his time (or her own).
<br />

<br />
2.  Another first date dinner scenario.  This time the conversation wasn't going too well, all she really said the whole time was &quot;For some reason I was expecting you to be bigger, you looked bigger in the picture.  You're really skinny.&quot;  As they were walking to their cars in the parking lot, he asked if she still wanted to talk or see him again.  She put on her sunglasses and said &quot;I'm sorry.  That's all I can say.&quot;  She got in her car and drove away.
<br />

<br />
I'll have to ask him what his favorite dating horror stories are when I see him at work tomorrow!</td>

Several years ago, I went through a period of post-divorce dating using the Personals in Columbus Monthly magazine (which was a sort-of upscale place you went before all the online sites). This involved a magazine ad, post office box, letters, and telephone calls much more than web site and emails.
<br />

<br />
I went on 25+ first dates, as I recall. In general the experience was positive and interesting, although I started off with few dating skils. I went on no actual date until we had talked on the phone for a time, seeing if we might want to take it to a lunch/dinner meeting stage. In general, this avoided the awkward &quot;no way are we compatible&quot; moments on first meetings. 
<br />

<br />
The two most memorable of my dates:
<br />

<br />
1) There was a 24-year-old widow with two kids and no teeth. (She had teeth, but didn't have them with her or in her mouth when on our first date - she'd recently &quot;misplaced&quot; them.) She brought her two kids (no problem, we'd talked about the kids).  The son, perhaps 11, started out by emptying <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">every</span></span> packet of sugar on the table  into his mouth, and then discussed every facet of TV wrestling, which was his career choice. She called every 3-4 weeks to talk, and we stayed telephone friends for a time (until she got married), but we never dated again.
<br />

<br />
2) I drove to Zanesville (about 90 miles) after work one night for a first-date dinner with a woman who lived there. I met her at a Denny's on the outskirts of town. She had taken a taxi, as her ex-husband had stolen her car a few days before so she had no transportation. Dinner went OK, she seemed nice. She was a prison guard at a local facility, and confided that she had a gun in her purse. No real problem there for me (I shot handguns in competition at the time), and we completed dinner. We had agreed in advance that we were <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">just</span></span> doing dinner, as I needed to get back home at a reasonable hour for work the next day, and had a couple hours of driving to do.  I offered to drive her home (since she had no car), and followered her instructions into the center of town, where she lived in an apartment over a really seedy-looking bar. I said my goodbyes, and she invited me upstairs for coffee. I declined, reminding her that we'd agreed in advance that I needed to return home right after dinner. She began yelling at me, and refused to get out of the car. I was mindful of the gun in her purse (which I never saw but fully believed was there), and talked her down to merely sobbing a bit. She finally got out, and I got out of range a quickly as I could without hurting here feelings any further or slamming into any cars!
<br />

<br />
This was the date that ended my Personal Ads experiences! I did continue to date one of the women I met through this process for a time, but didn't do any more &quot;first dates&quot;!</td>

Wow, those are some crazy stories. I've apparently been lucky in the dating department. I met my wife through Yahoo personals and it was the very first time I tried using it. She had an ad on there, however I didn't because I wanted to avoid riff-raff contacting me.  I got sick of wasting time dating people who weren't compatible with me so I did a search on there and came up with her. It was probably a freak occurance of luck on my part, we got married a little over 1 year later. Now we own a house, three dogs, and have a boatload of wedding expense debt.....we're living the American dream <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Not compatible with me is: has kids, smokes, or has no ambition to do anything in life. oh yeah, haha...ladies with no teeth are STRICTLY prohitibed OhioMoose <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
My wife claims I dated to many &quot;high maintenance&quot; girls.</td>

I'm glad you guys found each other! Life's too short to spend looking!
<br />

<br />
I learned at some point in my life that single mothers should not be excluded: they have a realistic view of life, and have generally proven themselves capable of dealing with less than perfect times.  I had an office mate who avoided dating women with cheldren, and I tried to 'splain it to him, but he was young and foolish!
<br />

<br />
My toothless friend once explained in some detail about the advantages of a woman with no teeth...I don't recall what it was.... 
<br />

<br />
I know from observing friends and acquaintances that the most unlikely and seemingly incompatible people often make the best couples, people who would never have chosen themselves from a web description.  Outside of two people wanting to make each other happy, I know of no way to pre-judge the suitability of a possible mate. (I sure wish there were: it would save a lot of time &amp; money, but what the heck, it's all &quot;Training For Life&quot;!).

Dating gives us all something to talk about when we are old...</td>

I think I know what &quot;advantages&quot; she was talking about...

<br />
In stark contrast to your story I dated my dental hygienist for a while. She actually asked me out while I was getting my teeth cleaned. <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
My wife and I are drastically different. Nobody can believe we're married. Total opposites, she's outgoing and I'm quiet. We compliment each other well though so it's actually a great match.

I didn't date women with kids because I'm not a &quot;kid person&quot;.</td>

My wife and I volunteer every summer for a camp for foster care kids.  During the training, they have you do one of the gazillion &quot;personality profile&quot; tests so that you'll know how to handle other staff members.  This particular one comes back color based and says you have a red, yellow, blue, or green dominant personality.  The camp directors want the staff people to understand everyone's personality so that you know you're dealing with a &quot;blue&quot; or a &quot;red&quot; and that way you'll tailor your comments or attitude.  It sorta works...
<br />

<br />
Anyhow, the whole point being... my wife and I are exact opposites on the profile.  I'm a yellow, which means I'm pretty laid back, takes a lot to get me rattled, I HATE schedules, like things to just kinda flow along, like to be very extroverted and social.  My wife, on the other hand, is a blue.  She wants things on a schedule, wants to know every detail, is pretty introverted, and so forth.  There are a lot of husband-wife teams at this camp, and amazingly, probably 70% - 80% test the same way... opposites.  (Red with green, yellow with blue).
<br />

<br />
Personally, it's probably a good thing that opposites attract.  We'd likely never get anything done if both of us were laid back.  For my wife and I, the big challenge comes at vacation time.  This will probably explain the personality thing better...  
<br />

<br />
My ideal vacation:  Grab the suitcases and a week's worth of warm clothes...  we're heading south.  Don't know where, yet... probably the beach.  No reservations yet.
<br />

<br />
My wife:  We're leaving on vacation on May 20th.  I need to start drawing up a list of everything we are going to need.  Honey, have you got all of our reservations made and confirmed yet?  How much money will we need?  How far are we driving the first day?  Where are we staying?  (I think you get the point!)   <img src="images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /></td>

Leo and I are still in the not-getting-married-yet stage in our relationship (because we can barely afford college...we don't need more debt yet!) and lots of people wonder how the hell we're together; we have quite a bit in common, but at the same time we're quite different. I think the trick with us is that he's willing to give my hobbies a chance, and I'm willing to put up with his (as most of them really just bore me...like basketball  <img src="images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> )</td>
