What &quot;famous&quot; people have you either met or seen up close and personal somewhere (by up close and personal I mean somewhere other than a concert or huge event where you were just attending). List who, what they are known for and where you saw them and anything that surprised you about them.
<br />

<br />
For me....
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Seen up close:</span>
<br />

<br />
Bill Clinton (former pres.) - at the University of Akron following a speech. Not really surprised but impressed by how comfortable he seemed interacting with &quot;average&quot; people off the street.
<br />
John Glenn (former Senator &amp; Astronaut) - on Main St. back in Coshocton, I was surprised that he didn't seem as friendly as everyone claims. Maybe it was just a bad day.
<br />
John Edwards (Former Senator &amp; Vice Presidential Candidate) - Campaign event in downtown Columbus, actually shook hands (big deal for me I'm dare I say LIBERAL!) Something that surprised me was that he's shorter than I am.
<br />
Nick Carter &amp; AJ McClean (Backstreet Boys) - RedZone Nightclub here in Columbus, surprised...well not really, by how unimpressive these two were in person. 
<br />
David Copperfield (magician) met him out in Las Vegas following a show (me and about 200 other people) <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Local Celebrities:</span>
<br />

<br />
Gym Ganahl (NBC 4 Chief Meteorologist), met him at a gas station, seemed like a really nice guy. Didn't really act anything like he does on TV.
<br />
Jummy Crum (former NBC Sports Newscaster). At the Ohio State Fair, really friendly guy. 
<br />
Cabot Rea (NBC 4 Anchor), at a parade in Westerville, acted exactly the same as he does on TV but then again we were at a parade.
<br />
Michael B. Coleman (Mayor of Columbus) - met him at the Happy Dragon Chinese Restaurant in German Village. I've also seen him at a couple of other events and normally he'll talk to anyone and everyone around. Very friendly and very outgoing.
<br />
Les Wexner (Limited Brands Chairman) met him during the construction of Easton. Was really surprised at how friendly this guy was. I installed most of the audio/video system at Macys in Easton.
<br />
Weazel Boy (from WNCI's Morning Zoo) almost everyone in Columbus has met this guy. I was surprised by how small he is. 
<br />
Joy Padgett (Ohio Senator) met her in Coshocton we're both from there. 
<br />
Jay Burson (former OSU basketball star) he's best know for a terrible accident that occured in a game that resulted in him breaking his neck and having to wear a HALO brace for a while. I have an autograph on a check stub he signed for me at a Coshocton vs. John Glenn basketball game during high school. Last I heard he was coaching somewhere.
<br />
Donald Plusquellic (Mayor of Akron Ohio), while I was a student at the University of Akron. Was VERY impressed by how intelligent this guy is. I was hoping he would run for governor this year.
<br />

<br />
I also saw some guy everyone else claims was LeBron James at Soutpark Mall in Strongsville, Ohio but I'm not so sure about that one so it's not on the actual list. It could have been him, who knows.</td>

Good luck Mynx!
<br />

<br />
One of my old g/f's was a model for mainly Abercrombie &amp; Fitch along with a few hair product companies.  She was on some of the A&amp;F shopping bags for a while and in a few of their ads. She ended up doing that after working at A&amp;F as a &quot;fit model&quot; which is someone who tries on clothes to make sure they look good and are comfortable. They've since gone to some big name agencies with even skinnier models <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />

<br />
I need to add a couple groups to my list:
<br />

<br />
They Might Be Giants (alt. band) Cleveland Agora Theater. I never liked this band until I seen them in concert. They sound EXACTLY like they do on a CD none of that &quot;what the hell are they saying&quot; crap that happens at most bands concerts.
<br />
SR71 (Alt Rock Band) at the bar at Newport Music Hall during a power failure.</td>

President Jimmy Carter when I was a kid.  He was marching in a local parade and my cousin's Boy Scout troop was helping out somehow.  I was there when Carter greeted all the scout troop and got to shake his hand.
<br />

<br />
Then governor, now senator, John D Rockefeller.  He was attending the county fair in my rural West Virginia town.  I was only 7 or 8 years old, but my parents tell me that I walked right up to him and introduced myself.  I guess I wasn't too introverted as a child.
<br />

<br />
David Copperfield - I was the stage manager for our university auditorium when I was in college.  It was really wild as to the amount of security they had involved with setting up his show.
<br />

<br />
Former Vice Prez Dan Quayle.  I lived in his hometown of Huntington, Indiana for about 6 years.  Saw him at two or three community events.  Also ran into him at Nick's, a local greasy spoon that he would frequent whenever he was in town.</td>

Pac Sun (Pacific Sunwear) is a clothing store mainly for people in their teens to early 20's. My brother gets a lot of his skateboarding brand clothing there. I still get things there every now and then myself. You'll find it in the mall.</td>

If you are ever in the west some time, and go to Pac Sun, look for a brunette with blue eyes. I mean there may be a ton of them, but I also have no clue which photo is hanging up!</td>
