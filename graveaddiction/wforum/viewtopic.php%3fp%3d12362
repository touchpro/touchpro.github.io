I decided to take the plunge and go visit this large cemetery today. Let me say first off that I dont like drivng in Columbus, but despite that it was really easy to get there just by taking 70 to 71 and getting off at Green Lawns exit. Anyway I took 400 pics and after down loading them onto my computer I was stunned to discover I didnt have a blurred one, in fact their all good pics! For me this is practicly imposible as I tend to get tight in the arms and wrists after taking many pics and twitch ocasionally as the camera snaps.
<br />
  Other than that It was a good first visit, although it is imposible to see or take pics of it all in just one day I did  manage to put a dent in it today.
<br />
 
<br />
  I was however somewhat disapointed in the condition of certain sections of the cemetery. many broken or damaged tombstones lay fallen towards the back of the cemetery and although I'm sadly sure some of the damage was from vandalism, alot of it was readlily recognisable as damage from fallen tree limbs and buroughing from ground hogs and vermin. these are both things that can be prevented by caretakers, the cemetery is unusually densely wooded in places and I spoted several dead trees and more with rotting dead limbs, I have too wander why more hasnt been done to remove such hazards. As well varmits should be shot, poisoned or some other effective means of pest control instituted to rid the graveyard of their presence, for some reason they seem drawn to undermine monuments foundations and often this results in leaning or even tobbled monumnets.
<br />
 Lastly I even found monuments standing under trees where the tree limbs had been allowed to grow in such a way as to shove the tops of obolisks off to go crashing to the ground, these were the worst for me because unlike dead tree limbs coming down in a storm this clearly happened over the course of years when it could have been prevented, I often see such damage as these in other graveyards, often small or remote ones, that have been relegated to the county to tend, but is even worse I think to see  in such a splended and huge cemetery as this suffering from such neglect. Especially when prevention is so much cheaper then trying to repair damage after the fact. Trimming the trees back, removing dead growth or even some of the trees entirely and getting rid of the pests would prevent a large amount of future damage.
<br />
 Anyway it was still a fun trip and I also stoped and took a few pics at green Lawn Abbey while I was there, however it was closed up as I have heard it usually is.</td>

Glad you enjoyed your visit to Green Lawn!
<br />

<br />
I personally think Green Lawn is doing a great job at trying to repair the older sections of the cemetery.  These repairs are very costly, and I'm sure most of the new money goes to the newer section (which makes sense since those sections are visited much more frequently).  Green Lawn has a great volunteer program started, and many of the older sections are being adopted.  I've often thought about getting volunteers together to have the website adopt one of these sections - I know I'd certainly be willing to help restore some of the old gravestones there!</td>

Sounds like you had a pretty good trip &amp; congrats on all the photos! I tend to end up with a few blurred ones too.....I have to go to a meeting in Columbus next week, and I'm thinking about just heading on down to Greenlawn afterwards...since I'll be downtown anyway. I've never been there, but always wanted to see it!</td>

It was really cool and both what I expected and at the same time not what I expected. I got to see some really intricate memorials and some of them were very large, especially one of the Mausileums in particular, and their was quite a few statues I really enjoyed seeing. but all the sections I visited were basicly flat with no real landscaping or artistic arrangement Like I have seen in some other cemeterys. I didnt see the whole cemetery by any means tho so it could be there somewhere. There was a pond out back of some of the mausileums that was the closest it came to landscaping but it seemed half drained and not taken care of from what I could see. Anyway I did enjoy my visit and I got to see tons of headstones  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />
  On second thought I take it back as trees count as landscaping, and there are plenty of trees in this cemetery.</td>
