Hello.  I just stumbled across your site while surfing.  While I've noticed there's a lot of haunted stuff in Ohio, Ive never seen any references to what my friends and I encountered.  I'll tell my story after I see what other people have to say.
<br />

<br />
So, anyone ever hear of/experience anything spooky on AU Campus?</td>

<hr />
The past few days I've been collecting my thoughts and trying to remember details and I've started to wonder if what happened at AU was the result of a haunting or the result of more normal circumstances.  Going over this stuff in my head it all seems kind of silly now, but I'll tell you my story and you guys can make of it what you will.
<br />

<br />
I was a student at AU from fall '87 through spring '91, majoring in theatre.  The theatre is named for Hugo H. Young, and there is a portrait of him in the theatre.  (I did some googling to try and find out more about him and came up with very little.  He is not to be confused with the British reporter of the same name.  &quot;My&quot; Hugo was a founder of the Flxible company which was involved in the production of motorcycle sidecars and later buses.  He was also a member of the Masons.)
<br />

<br />
Those of us in the theatre crowd became convinced that the thatre was haunted by Mr. Young, whom we affectionately referred to as &quot;Hughost.&quot;  While I never saw him personally, several of my friends did, and I was present for some of his &quot;antics.&quot;  He never showed up when there was faculty or other &quot;grown ups&quot; present, and he never disturbed a performance.  He would only show up when there were only students working (or screwing around) in the theatre.  There were many Hughost &quot;sightings&quot; but I'll just mention the three that I can remember any details about.
<br />

<br />
When I was a Freshman, I was helping one of the upperclassmen (Karl) with the lights for an upcoming show.  We were in the light booth  working on the light board when the board started to go nuts.  Looking up we saw that the stage lights we flashing on and off randomly, for no apparent reason.  Karl started fiddling with the board and after a few seconds I told him to shut it off.  &quot;I just did!&quot; he responded.  A few seconds more of fiddling and flashing and I told him to unplug it, to which he responded &quot;I just did!&quot; again.  We ran out of the booth and the theatre at that point.  Thinking that there may have been some kind of electrical problem in the building, I asked someone in the hall if there had been any kind of blackout, flashing lights, etc, out here.  She told me that everything was normal.  I also considered the possibility of a thunderstorm somehow interfering, but I looked outside and it was a bright sunshinny afternoon.  We also checked with the Technical Director and he had no idea of what was going on.  We returned to the theatre and everything was normal and the board worked fine after that.  We attributed this to Hughost.
<br />

<br />
The other two occurances happened when we were playing a game called &quot;Murder.&quot;  I'll skip the details on the game itself(though it is loads of fun), and just mention that we were sneaking into the theatre at night(one of us had a set of keys), turning the lights down low, putting on spooky music and some of us were drinking.  I realize this is a recipe for scaring the crap out of ourselves, but, for what it's worth, here's what happened.
<br />

<br />
Because we played the game in the main theatre as well as the studio theatre just offstage, we would use both sound systems in both theatres.  Partway through the night, my friend with the keys told me he had locked his keys in the studio's sound booth.  He then told me to listen to the music.  It was Jean-Luc Ponty (which I wasn't familiar with) and it was on side two.  He had started it on side one.  My thought was that it was one of those tape decks that would auto-flip a tape whenever it finished one side.  He told me that tape deck didn't have that function. Somebody had to have flipped that tape, but thre was no way in.  We decided Hughost was playing games with us.
<br />

<br />
Another time in the middle of a game two of the girls (who were on stage)screamed and said they had seen Hughost up on the catwalk.  We stopped the game and all met on stage.  As we were all present (and the catwalk was out-of-bounds anyway) there had to be somebody else up there.
<br />

<br />
NOTE1:  Both girls were sober and were POSITIVE they saw someone, otherwise we wouldn't have stopped the game.
<br />

<br />
NOTE2:  A bit of a description may be in order here.  The catwalk is above the ceiling.  The ceiling is slanted and made of a couple of overlapping pieces, so you can focus lights onto the stage with the lights themselves being hidden from the audience.  While you can see the catwalk from the stage somewhat (depends on lighting) you couldn't get a real good look given the current lighting.
<br />

<br />
There are only three ways to access the catwalk, all visible from the stage.  With everyone else watching, three of us brave lads each went to one of the catwalk entrances.  Two of the three were unlocked.  The two that made it to the catwalk made a complete search and found no signs of anyone.
<br />

<br />
The girls that saw him swore it looked just like Hugo's portrait on the wall.  There are other cases where other people who saw someone looking like the portrait, either on the catwalk or in the house (I was present for at least one of those, though I can't remember much detail).  We did end up deciding that he was harmless, and that Hughost was just keeping an eye on &quot;his&quot; theatre (presumably he donated the money for it to be built).  I haven't been back in years, so I don't know if there have been more sightings since I left.  I'm also not aware of any sightings prior to my time there.
<br />

<br />
Beefy, does any of this ring a bell?  I don't remember any other ghost stories around Ashland.</td>

No, but I do remember what stories I heard being in the theatre, but what ghost story at school isn't in the theatre? That's odd... I'd love to check it out!
<br />

<br />
EDIT: I'm not sure if I did hear something about that school now... seems like I did though. I just checked Forgotten Ohio for something like that and there's nothing. Usually he has everything...</td>
