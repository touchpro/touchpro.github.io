Folks:
<br />

<br />
I'm getting very interested in locating and documenting &quot;missing&quot;, &quot;lost&quot;, or &quot;destroyed&quot; cemeteries as a sub-specialization of this cemetery photography pursuit. 
<br />

<br />
Do you know of a good book or web site on the burial practices of the early to mid-1800s? What I'm looking foris a way to think like an 1800s Ohio pioneer, looking at a plot of land and deciding where to start planting my newly-departed family members as croak. This for family plots, rather than community/church plots. 
<br />

<br />
What's got me thinking like this is my hunt for Courtwright (Courtright?) Cemetery in Concord Township, Delaware County Ohio. I know approximately where it was reported as being, but searchers in 1987 were unable to locate it.  It's on a fairly large plot of land. I have a map that shows the property lines of the plots owned by the Courtwright family in 1866, but I'm not sure that it will limit the area of search enough - just give me a smarter idea of where to start looking. A great deal of the Courtwright land was covered with water (&quot;Twin Lakes&quot;) when they built  O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1924. However &quot;Courtright Cemetery&quot;
<br />
was mapped by the WPA project in the late 30's (albeit as being only &quot;0.01 acres&quot;, which seems to generally indicate only one or two graves)   so it's wasn't under water.  When the Twin Lakes park area was built, it might have been destroyed, though, depending on where it was. 
<br />

<br />
The search area for Courtwright is a brush-covered patch which has never had any buildings on it, owned by the City of Columbus Ohio. I'm planning a visual, non-destructive search, followed perhaps by a &quot;probe-the earth&quot; search for shallowly-buried stones with a dowel. This is all a thought exercise at present, and I intend to involve the City of Columbus and the Delaware County Historical Society in the planning before doing anything. It's a low-budget project, so I don't plan to be buying any ground-penetrating radar satellite time!
<br />

<br />
I *think*, from seeing various cemeteries and looking at their locations on topo maps, that they would pick a spot overlooking water if possible) and a spot higher rather than lower in elevation (if possible), but I don't know if they thought like that at all or if I'm just projecting my own thoughts on the process. I also assume they'd keep the graves on their own property (as owned at that time).
<br />

<br />
Thoughts anyone?
<br />

<br />
In addition to Courtright, I have interest in pursuing a &quot;destroyed&quot; cemetery (Hensel, in Jerome Township, Union County Ohio), where the stone(s) for mid-1800s graves were reportedly pushed into a creek in the 1980s along with the debris from the demolition of an old schoolhouse. Finding the stones would be the goal, using research of news coverage of the demolition, personal interviews with construction folk (if possible), and interviews with residents of the area. It's possible that the stone(s) and remains were moved to another local cemetery and that the reports of bulldozing on the web are incorrect. The area of the old school is now a community park.
<br />

<br />
There is another local case (Depp Cemetery, Concord Township, Delaware County Ohio) where stones were removed from an historic early 1800s cemetery for cleanup in the 1930s and then &quot;misplaced&quot; by the Township. Only one stone was left on the site. The Delaware County Historical Society's expert on my Township thinks that the stones were likely stored in someone's garage or barn, and may still be in the area. The goal is finding the stones and arranging to have them returned to the cemetery site.
<br />

<br />
All three of these sites are within a mile or so of my house!
<br />

I think you are correct about cemeteries being located on spots with higher elevations.  It seems to be the trend with cemeteries I've visited anyway.  
<br />

<br />
I think this sounds like a fun project...I can't wait to see how many lost cemeteries you'll find!!</td>

Most of the older cemeteries, particularly family ones, that I've visited are almost always on a knoll or hilltop.  Granted, I'm from West Virginia, so it's hard not to find a knoll or hilltop to build the cemetery on.  Anyhow, my grandmother used to always tell me the main reason they did it was to keep water out of the graves.  If a tomb was low in a valley, the water table would be closer to the surface and more likely to flood Uncle Jim-Bob's casket in a heavy rain.  Up on the hillside, the water would run off of Aunt Millie's grave down into the valley, leaving her casket dry.
<br />

<br />
If you think about it, in today's age, it really doesn't matter much, as modern cemeteries use steel or aluminum vaults that lock down with an airtight seal.  But, 50-100 years ago, when the only choices were pine, oak, or mahogany... water could definitely pose a problem.
<br />

<br />
I've also been one who believes another reason they were up on hillside was because it was usually a peaceful place.  Somewhere you can go and get away from things, have a nice view, and just spend time remembering your loved ones.  That's just my twist.</td>

The information about the water/flood damage makes total sense!  
<br />

<br />
When I went up to the Bowling Green area last summer, it seemed like every cemetery we visited was on a small hill.  It's pretty flat up there, definitely a lot less hills than we have down here.  
<br />

<br />
The only downside I can see to having cemeteries located on hills, especially steep ones, is erosion.  Sometimes the graves located on the slope of these hills have almost all the ground beneath them eroded away...it looks like the stones could just fall over.</td>

Actually, the erosion thing was a possibility.  Again, going back to conversations with my grandmother many years ago...  she told me about one cemetery where the hill caved in and caskets were literally sticking out of the hillside.  Of course, this is another West Virginia issue... the area where my grandmother was from was just full of coal mines.  Back in the day when there weren't regulations or hi-tech mapping systems.  These guys just cut miles and miles of mines deep in the mountains, following the coal seams wherever they went.  When the seam ended, they moved out of the mine and started another one... leaving the last one to rot.  Even today, there are places you can drive by in WV where a hillside will just slide in all at once because a long forgotten mine finally caved in.  As I recall my grandmother telling this, that was why the hillside at this particular cemetery gave way.

My grandmother was born in 1909, so this would have probably happened around 1915-1920.</td>

We had that coal mine collapse problem in Coshocton County every once in a while. Not nearly as bad as parts of West Virginia but it was fairly common. A section of the Southeast side of the City of Coshocton has several underground mines that either cause sink holes or water problems for the newer homes in that area. Some of the homes out in there are $300,000+ so needless to say the owners aren't very happy about the fact that their homes are built over abandoned mines. The houses were built in the 70's, 80's, 90's and 2000's so nobody even thought about the possibility of abandoned mines. 150 years go that area wasn't even close to being inside the city limits.</td>

I've also been one who believes another reason they were up on hillside was because it was usually a peaceful place.  Somewhere you can go and get away from things, have a nice view, and just spend time remembering your loved ones.  That's just my twist.</td></tr></table>

The area of the Courtright Cemetery I'm hunting has also changed in nature since it was established, with the building of a dam on the Scioto river in 1924 that flooded the small ravine which would be overlooked by the search area. Unfortunately, I don't have topo maps from the mid-1850s (I guess that their GPS units wouldn't work until AA batteries were invented   <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> ).
<br />

<br />
It's still possible that some of the older folks in the area may have a memory of where the small cemetery was located - it was logged by WPA in the late 1930s, and likely survived beyond that. Kids play *everywhere*! 
<br />

<br />
My barber shop also handles a lot of &quot;blue hairs&quot; and &quot;grey hairs&quot; from the neighborhood, so I'm going to recruit the folks there to ask them about the local cemeteries. The shop has a bulletin board with several articles which include some history of Depp Cemetery and it's ties to the Underground Railroad, so they have an interest in local history. The search for Courtwright Cemetery should be right up their alley.</td>
