<hr />
I'm positive that more than likely nobody here knows where this is lol. Hell, I grew up there and I'm still not entirely sure lol.
<br />

<br />
In all actuallity, it's really easy to find, yet people still can't figure it out. Almost anybody that's familiar with Cincinnati knows of College Hill. Well, North College Hill is, unbelievably, north of College Hill!
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I grew up there, went to school there, still have family and friends there. I love the place even though it's starting to be a crap town.
<br />

<br />
One thing I noticed while growing up there is, there are a LOT of homes and places that are haunted there. And there's no real reason for it. No war was ever fought there. No giant fire took out half of the city there. Godzilla never made a stop there. It's almost strange.
<br />

<br />
The only things I can think of that would cause that... a riot that took place about 40 or 50 years ago. It was over religion and politics and the city folks had enough and rioted. They burned businesses and trashed homes. But from what I remember, not a lot of people even so much as got injured. There may have been a couple deaths, and a few injuries, but not enough to cause a city wide haunting.
<br />

<br />
Then there's the cholora epidemic that went thru town. That is probably the most probable reason for it. In the late 1800's Cincinnati was hit with a cholora epidemic that killed many many people. To take refuge from it, the non sick traveled north, ending up in what is now Mt. Healthy. That of course was named after the healthy that moved there. To get there, they had to go thru what is now NCH. I'm sure not all of the travelers made it quite to Mt. Healthy, and maybe some of the folks that thought they were healthy weren't, and maybe died from Cholora in NCH. Who knows...
<br />

<br />
There was also the "myth" of a city that's burried under NCH. My friend Joe told me about living on this one street at the edge of NCH and another city when he was a kid, and he'd run around in these woods behind some houses there. He said one day he was playing in the woods and discovered a fire hydrant. Like one you'd see on the street in front of houses... only in the middle of the woods. There's no reason for that.
<br />

<br />
He said he heard from someone that there was a town there a while back and there was a bad earthquake and it took out the homes and killed just about everyone that lived there. Then after several years, NCH was built on top of what used to be that town and that's why so many places are haunted.
<br />

<br />
I have no idea if that ever happened, and I'm pretty sure on the history of NCH, so I don't think that ever happened. But there's still no explanation of the hauntings.
<br />

<br />
I currently know of about 10 homes that are haunted in NCH (I lived in 2 of them). A couple of businesses claim to be, and the high school's PAC (Performing Arts Center) is haunted. For those who know NCH, they know that it's not that big of a city. It's only about 4 miles by 3 miles big. So for that many places to be haunted, it would almost seem, at least to me, that something would've had to happen to cause that. Or it's just a huge coincidence.
<br />

<br />
In the PAC, I experienced something. That's the part of the school that held the stage. It's one of the top theatre's in Cincinnati, maybe even Ohio. Putting on plays there was always a blast, as the stage is very big, and very nice. It holds something like 400 people in the seats.
<br />

<br />
We also had our concerts there for band. It was during one of these that I, and the rest of the band, had an experience. Our band director, Mr. Trenton (I can't believe I can't remember how to spell his name!!!) was a very cool guy. In school he was my mentor. Nothing seemed to ever shake him up, and he almost always had a joke for any situation. It was tradition every year to get the new crop of freshman in the PAC for the first time for our first concert of the year and he'd tell them about the PAC Ghost.
<br />

<br />
This one year, I do believe my Junior year, he's standing on the side of our row, and he's going on and on about the occurances of the "ghost". Immediately behind him is a row of lights that went from the stage to almost the ceiling. As he's in the middle of his story, a 3 foot metal pipe falls from the top, crashing thru the lights and landing right behind him with a loud metallic thud! He just stood there, smiled, and said, "See?" The school had to put out over $5000 to fix the busted lights. He obviously didn't set that up.
<br />

<br />
Rumor is, a couple of students burned to death on the cat walk above the stage when the theatre caught on fire several years ago. Fact is, the theatre did catch on fire and burned almost the whole thing to the ground. I don't know for sure if there were any students to die in the fire though.
<br />

<br />
I don't know if there would be any places openly available to hunt though, and that's the only problem. All of the people I knew there that lived in haunted houses no longer live in those houses, and it's not easy to get access to the school, especially for something like that.
<br />

<br />
But if anyone's interested in taking a tour of those haunted locations I know of, feel free to let me know and we can work something out. Of course the tour would be of the drive-by variety.
<br />

<br />
And Beth, there's a great little cemetery there that I'm sure you'd love to check out. It's right on the corner of the major intersection in town, at W. Galbraith Rd. and Hamilton Ave. It's only got a handful of graves there, and it's not big by any means. It's from the early 1900's. If you'd want to make a day out of it, you'd have to pick another place to go also, as you could at most spend an hour here, and that's being really generous lol. We're talking of maybe 30 graves. But it sits... right out front from the HIGH SCHOOL!!!!! *cue eerie music*</td>

In the PAC, I experienced something. That's the part of the school that held the stage. It's one of the top theatre's in Cincinnati, maybe even Ohio. Putting on plays there was always a blast, as the stage is very big, and very nice. It holds something like 400 people in the seats.
<br />

<br />
We also had our concerts there for band. It was during one of these that I, and the rest of the band, had an experience. Our band director, Mr. Trenton (I can't believe I can't remember how to spell his name!!!) was a very cool guy. In school he was my mentor. Nothing seemed to ever shake him up, and he almost always had a joke for any situation. It was tradition every year to get the new crop of freshman in the PAC for the first time for our first concert of the year and he'd tell them about the PAC Ghost.
<br />

<br />
This one year, I do believe my Junior year, he's standing on the side of our row, and he's going on and on about the occurances of the "ghost". Immediately behind him is a row of lights that went from the stage to almost the ceiling. As he's in the middle of his story, a 3 foot metal pipe falls from the top, crashing thru the lights and landing right behind him with a loud metallic thud! He just stood there, smiled, and said, "See?" The school had to put out over $5000 to fix the busted lights. He obviously didn't set that up.
<br />

<br />
Rumor is, a couple of students burned to death on the cat walk above the stage when the theatre caught on fire several years ago. Fact is, the theatre did catch on fire and burned almost the whole thing to the ground. I don't know for sure if there were any students to die in the fire though.
<br />

<br />
I don't know if there would be any places openly available to hunt though, and that's the only problem. All of the people I knew there that lived in haunted houses no longer live in those houses, and it's not easy to get access to the school, especially for something like that.
<br />

<br />
But if anyone's interested in taking a tour of those haunted locations I know of, feel free to let me know and we can work something out. Of course the tour would be of the drive-by variety.
<br />

<br />
And Beth, there's a great little cemetery there that I'm sure you'd love to check out. It's right on the corner of the major intersection in town, at W. Galbraith Rd. and Hamilton Ave. It's only got a handful of graves there, and it's not big by any means. It's from the early 1900's. If you'd want to make a day out of it, you'd have to pick another place to go also, as you could at most spend an hour here, and that's being really generous lol. We're talking of maybe 30 graves. But it sits... right out front from the HIGH SCHOOL!!!!! *cue eerie music*</td></tr></table>

Thats wild. I live in Cincinnati also and never heard about NCH being so haunted.
<br />
Ever heard about or been to Buffalo Ridge? I heard that there is a crematorium that got burnt down by locals with people in it and the area is now haunted. I seen the supposed crematorium but it was just a concrete foundation and rubble. Could have been anything i guess.</td>

Let me debunk that now lol. Yeah, I've been there... and I can't go back. I almost died one night on that road, well, the one that takes you to Buffalo Ridge. I was hill hopping and lost control of my car. Slammed into a telephone poll backwards doing 90. It wasn't fun.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, that thing on Buffalo Ridge is actually an old planetarium or whatever they're called, with the giant telescope and all that. Back in the day the people that lived around there were rich, and they wanted expensive things for their community, so they had that built. Unfortunately for them, funding ran out before it was completed, so it was a scrapped idea and so it just sits there... building urban legends about it. The road itself, Buffalo Ridge was also never completed, which you can see when you drive to the end of it. You can see where the trees were cleared out for the road, they just never got around to paving it.
<br />

<br />
And yes, NCH is that haunted lol. There's a ton more stuff than what I put there too.</td>

Yea Ive been on the road that just stops that youre talking about. Ive heard alot of crazy stories as to why. Yours seems to be more practical. Funnt how legend stretches something otherwise boring into a haunting paranormal tale. It was still fun to check out though. There was another spot kind of out that way but closer to old Colerain called Munchkinville. Im sure youve been there too then. I heard it was "haunted". If you get bored post some more stories about NCH.</td>

Buffalo Ridge is the road that stops and looks like it should continue. Have you actually been back to the building? I've never actually gone, I've just assumed that something was back there. I also heard a tale about the last house on that street before it dead ends. I heard a witch lives there lol. ANYWAY...
<br />

<br />
Yeah, Munchkinville. Not haunted. I've heard tons of stories about that too. It's just a place that you can rent for your kids birthday party or whatever. The rumors fly around about it, but there's nothing to it.
<br />

<br />
I once talked to the guy that owns that, since he met me at my car with a ball bat. First I told him I wasn't there to vandilize (sp?), and when he finally half trusted me I asked him why he's like that and he told me it was because of vandilizations. So nobody is allowed to just park alongside the place, or walk by it for that matter. He gets violent, and he has good reason. So just a heads up, if you happen to go out there to just take a look, make it a quick look.
<br />

<br />
And I've been wanting to post more on NCH, so if I get bored as you say lol, I'll post more. I got a bunch.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Ok, here's some stories. I think I've posted every story I know from NCH hauntings somewhere, so this may be brief. If you want me to expound on any of these let me know.
<br />

<br />
A friend of mine lived in a house with her mom and dad and two ghosts. One was an older man and he was the violent one. The other was a little girl and she liked to play and have fun, like a kid would. She's the one everyone heard all the time, but if anything happened physically or violently, it was the man.
<br />

<br />
Some things that happened in this house while I was there, footsteps upstairs when nobody was up there. This is where the girl played most of the time. Footsteps in the living room while I was in it, nobody walking. A glass slammed down on the kitchen table, nobody was in the kitchen. And I got many MANY feelings of ghosts in there. Mostly from the little girl, wanting to play hide and seek. I think she was trying to show me something, and unfortunately I never found it. But I blow it off by saying she was playing hide and seek with me.
<br />

<br />
My apartment was haunted. I think the whole building was, but the ghost seemed to like to mess with me. I nicknamed it "Pink" after several occurances with it and Pink Floyd. It didn't like the name so it left me alone.
<br />

<br />
Some things it did to me where banging on my bedroom door. I was the only one home. My room mate wasn't staying there at the time. My hallway light would turn on by itself. So would my bathroom light and my dining room light. My guitar played itself one day. My room mate heard it as well. We checked it and it had fallen off of the wall and onto the floor and the pick was still stuck in between the strings, yet we heard every string be plucked. And my tab book of Pink Floyd's The Wall was open on my floor one night and I heard the pages flipping. When they stopped I got up and looked at what song they stopped on... "Hey You". Freaked me out. I closed the book and later checked it out. The song I had been playing previously was before "Hey You" and if the weight of the pages had caused the pages to turn on their own, they would've turned the other way, and not to "Hey You".
<br />

<br />
The house on Catalpa is the worst. I compare it to the Amityville Horror... the original movie. We lived there for 6 years and after about 2 years is when things started happening. And from there it only got worse, and more often, to the point where something was happening every day. And it was so frequent that we just started not noticing it. Doors opening, people seeing apparitions, talking to apparitions, carrying on conversations with apparitions, things moving, disappearing, noises all over the house, whistling, doors slamming shut, windows opening and slamming shut, people being pulled off of beds by what they say felt like someone grabbing them by the ankle and pulling them and all blankets off of the bed.... the list goes on. Ghosts don't bother me, and I could live in a haunted house, but I couldn't be paid enough to move back into that one.
<br />

<br />
My friend Joe that I talked about. That house he lived in when he was playing in the woods and found the fire hydrant... that's the house he grew up in. He told me of apparitions walking down the hallway and rocking chairs rocking on their own.
<br />

<br />
The house he moved into right down the road, which is where he lived when I met him, was haunted as well. Nobody ever seen what was haunting it, but it always had a thick feeling. He called me one day and told me he was on his porch and had been for 3 hours with his dog. His dog, which was a trained attack dog, had all of his hair standing on end and he was snarling while looking at the front door, and then he backed up to the back door, ears went down, and he started whimpering, totally scared. Joe let him outside and Joe stayed with him, scared to go back in. So he called me. He was the only one home.
<br />

<br />
I heard rumors about different houses that were haunted, though I have no stories or proof, so I can't say. Casano's is one of them. The Goodman School is another. Again, no proof, so I don't know for sure. And there are several other houses that are apparently haunted. Most of which are friends houses where they'd just see something move or a shadow in their room. Tammy seen a lot of that in the two houses she lived in.
<br />

<br />
And another friend of mine told me once that he was in bed and he heard someone say "Hey, pssst..." and he looked around his room and heard it again and it was coming from his vent. He listened and heard a voice say, "Hey kid, come down to the basement." He told me he grabbed two knives and he slept with those that night.
<br />

<br />
Whew, that was pretty much all of the stories I know but summed up. Not bad... lol.</td>

If the builing you are talking about is the concrete foundation then yeah I was there. It was no more than a big empty foudation with spray paint all over it. Of course we were there in broad daylight so it wasnt as intense as maybe going at night. The odd thing was that maybe a hundred yards beyond the building there was an old car in the middle of the woods. It was rusted out. Im not a car guy but it looked like a late 50's, early 60's type car. It was just in the middle of nowhere, no road leading to it so how it got there and why it was abandoned was kind of odd. 
<br />

<br />
I heard about the witches in that house too. I grew up some in colerain so Im sure we heard alot of the same local stories being that you were just a shot down compton rd in NCH. I also heard that those "witches" can be seen doing sacrifices near a pond not far from them at midnight on certain nights...lol. Thanks for the stories i enjoyed them. I had no idea about nch being so active.</td>

I don't know what the building looks like. I've never been back to it. The car is odd though.
<br />

<br />
Yeah, NCH has some activity. I think I posted on my forum about my house on Catalpa and all, or most of, the activity that happened there. I'll PM you over there and show it to you.
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Here's the link if anyone wants to read what all happened in my house over there. I think I talked about it here though, but here it is anyway. Parabola, I still PM'd you there with the link. <a href="http://tmghosthunters.proboards26.com/index.cgi?board=stories&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1095761890" target="_blank">http://tmghosthunters.proboards26.com/index.cgi?board=stories&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1095761890</a> /EDIT
<br />

<br />
There was another story I forgot. I'm not sure if this house is in NCH or not, but it's right on the border. I can't believe I forgot this one. My mom told me about this and my grandmother validated it. My aunt still won't talk about it.
<br />

<br />
My grandma bought this house when it was first built, so she was the first owner. My mom and aunt lived there with her, as they were just teens. They had a gravel driveway that went along side the house and took up most of the back of the house, I guess so they could turn around or whatever.
<br />

<br />
My aunt was dating this guy at the time who was basically a Greaser. He had the slicked back hair, the leather jacket, the hot rod. And he smoked one kind of cigarette that nobody else in the house smoked.
<br />

<br />
My mom told me that she would hear his boots walking down the gravel driveway almost every night and she'd hear him tap on my aunt's window and my aunt would let him in and they'd do whatever it is they did and he'd leave.
<br />

<br />
She finally decided to break up with him because she had found someone else. That someone else is my uncle now lol. Anyway, he was upset but seemed to be ok, or so my mom said. One night he came over to the house to talk to my aunt, again tapping on the window and all that. Apparently he was with her for an hour or so, talking about them and the situation or whatever.
<br />

<br />
After he left, the phone rang. My aunt went out into the living room and answered it and it was a friend of hers, hysterical and crying. She told my aunt that the Greaser ex-boyfriend had been driving around that night with his best friend and they pulled into the parking lot of the UDF that used to be on Galbraith before it moved to Hamilton (those that lived around there would know lol). He pulled out his gun from the glovebox and shot himself in the face. He couldn't handle not being with my aunt.
<br />

<br />
My aunt told her friend that that was impossible, because he had just left her room where they had been talking for over an hour. Her friend assured her that he killed himself just about an hour before.
<br />

<br />
My aunt looked up and her ex was looking thru the front window at her... face and head covered in blood. She screamed and he disappeared.
<br />

<br />
My mom told me that every night after that she could hear his footsteps coming down the driveway and the tapping on my aunt's window. Eventually my aunt was so sick of it that she asked my mom to trade rooms with her and my mom agreed. She's never really been shaken up by anything like that anyway, so it was no big deal. But she did tell me that after she changed rooms she'd hear the tapping on the window every night until they moved out of the house.
<br />

<br />
And my grandma kept finding his cigarette butts in the ashtrays, even after he died.

That house is two doors down from the driveway back to the apartment complex where I had the ghost I named "Pink". I'm not sure if the house is still haunted by his ghost, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was.</td>

I consider it luck. My dad apologized to me for it once, giving me his "6th sense" so to speak, but I told him I enjoyed it. I'm not as "gifted" as he is but I'm working on it. He's the one that experienced the most in our old house.
<br />

<br />
One day many years after we moved out I caught him saying he missed that house because that was his last house that he owned and I almost smacked him because he was basically tortured in that house. Almost everything that happened in that house happened to him. At least the really bad stuff. Luckily I had already moved out of the house when the doors and windows started acting up in my room.
<br />

<br />
And sometimes, as odd as it may seem, I wish I was back in that house as well. The activity can't be beat and sometimes I just wish I had a place to hunt and as it is, the availability of that house isn't where I'd like it to be lol.
<br />

<br />
But that's why I know in my heart that there is such a thing as a haunting and there are such things as ghosts and spirits that walk with us every day. I can understand where skeptics come from, but I can absolutely positively guarantee that if any skeptic had lived for a month in that house would have a totally different perspective on things.</td>

Parabola, I know we have our differences, but I would still like to hunt with you sometime. I'd actually love to see that building thing off of Buffalo Ridge. I just can't drive over that way without freaking out. What's your schedule like? Mine's pretty simple. I usually get off of work every day at around noon or 1, and all of my afternoon's are free except the every other wednesday when I'm at the Pub. Usually the weekends are free too. Just let me know, I would like to get out and check out some haunted or apparently haunted stuff before the roads get too snowy.</td>
