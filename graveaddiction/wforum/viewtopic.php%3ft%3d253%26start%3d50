<hr />
Most people probably mail in their payments. The guy who runs the place is really easy to work with. Very friendly.
<br />

<br />
I can understand why people don't like paying online but....here's my public service announcement for the week so anybody who does pay online with credit/bank cards will feel a bit more comfortable with it <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
The news media really blows the dangers of paying via credit card online out of proportion. I have an extensive IT background, which included a job with Discover Card here in New Albany and it's not nearly as easy as joe public thinks it is to steal credit card information and then be able to actually use it. There are all kinds of safeguards working behind the scenes including actual fraud prevention technicians who monitor software that tracks credit card transactions. If a transaction occurs so many miles from your home address (usually 100 or more) or several transactions occur in a relatively short period of time, or a &quot;big ticket&quot; transaction occures, these people will be calling you to verify you actually made the purchase. In addition to that in many cases if you don't physically swipe the card you need additional information, including the exact name on the card, the 3 digit code on the back, and the expiration date. All of that information is contained in seperate databases at Discover so a hacker would have to hack into each of them, figure out their encryption process and then match the data to the number, which is virtually impossible since the encryption system is changed every so many days. Even employees wouldn't be able to do it before the system completely changed. The time you SHOULD be in a panic is if someone actually steals your physical card because that magnetic strip on the back contains ALL of the information people need to use your card to make purchases. In many cases today, for small purchases (less than $15), you don't even have to sign. 
<br />

<br />
Retailers don't hold any information about your credit card. Credit/debit card transactions are processed by third party vendors who specialize in card transactions. They either work behind the scenes through an online vendors website or via a transaction pad usually mounted by the checkout or physically on the Point-of-Sale system. Retailers only see that your card has been approved or denied. They never see any of your information unless you give them your card and they look at it. Many retailers have things set up so you can swipe your card on your own to reduce their liability should fraud take place. As far as the law is concerned if fraud does take place due to retailer or third party negligence they are responsible.
<br />

<br />
The third party vendors I mentioned above are people like Card Service International, Chase, (really any bank), etc. These people don't store all of the information needed to use your card in a single place either and also make use of encryption systems that are routinely changed (like a password at work that has to be changed every so many days). I remember a couple of months ago seeing a news story about some company down in Georgia that someone hacked into and stole a bunch of people's &quot;credit card information&quot;...well they stole a portion of it but not nearly enough to actually make transactions..which is why you never really heard anything else about it. It was front page &quot;fear laden&quot; news for the first month or two it was brough forward...hell even Congress was all bent out of shape about it, bit it died out. Congress really doesn't know how anything works, they freak out just like we do when something precieved as &quot;scary&quot; happens. The news media is far less likely to carry a story about how &quot;oh it was no big deal they couldn't use the information they had to make transactions&quot; than they are to run an &quot;worlds coming to an end people had their credit card numbers stolen&quot; story. 
<br />

<br />
So to make a short story long....it's safter than you think to pay with a credit/debit card online just ask yourself the following questions...
<br />

<br />
1. Is this a reputable website (PayPal would be it's owned by eBay) If you don't know do a little research
<br />
2. Is the transaction secure &quot;key or lock in bottom right corner of your browser (if it isn't there don't pay using that site)
<br />
3. Is this site based in the United States... (the UK, Canada, Australia are similar to us in laws and standards so those would most likely be safe sites as well) 
<br />

<br />
Lastly, if you want to pay online but your still a little paranoid...put a daily or weekly spending limit on your card so that it can only be used to purchase so many dollars per some set time period (like only $500 in a day). 
<br />

<br />
Social Security Numbers are on almost every single government document you turn in so forget trying to keep that a secret. Most government documents are public records that everyone has access too. 
<br />

<br />
Also, if you go through a bankruptcy all of your credit cards information with balances and your social security number are on public record documents, which in my opinion is REALLY bad. Divorce can also cause a lot of information to be public record that you would probably rather not be.</td>

Thanks Tom, that's great info!  You said it way better than I ever could, now I'm going to send this on to some of my friends and family members who worry non-stop about using their cards online.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I must say, I love Paypal.  I'm addicted to eBay, and one of the first things I look at before bidding is whether or not the seller accepts paypal.  It's so much easier than messing around with money orders!</td>

I'm aiming to get there around 7:30 - 7:45.  I think it took me just a little over an hour to get there last time.

We have close to 200 pics and Beth was also taking a lot of pics along with recording to catch EVP's. We haven't really gone through our pics throughly yet and some of them I have to have developled (old school film). We did have a picture of a door window on the second floor where it looks almost like someone is looking in from outside but I wanna get a few more opinions on that one before I buy that it's anything. 
<br />

<br />
The trip went well and even though it was pretty non-eventful we had a great time. They have a really laid back staff at Prospect Place which made the whole event relaxing for my wife and I who normally don't get much of a chance to just sit around doing nothing.  
<br />

<br />
I have to take the Ohio real estate licensing exam tomorrow so I'll be studying all night long, however tomorrow evening I'll start checking out the pics to see if we got anything good and if we did there will be posts about it here.</td>

I had fun last night too!  I haven't even started to look through the photos I took last night (I think I took 150-200), but I might start tomorrow night.  There's approximately 3.5 hours of audio stuff to listen to, so I'll put my headphones on and listen to it while I'm writing test plans tomorrow at work <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />  Even if we didn't pick up any EVP's, I'll try to put some conversion clips out here for all of you to listen too!</td>

We did have a great time!  Tom (N-A) has already started to look through the photos he and his wife took.  I'm a slacker...I haven't even downloaded mine to the computer yet.  But now that this week's site update is done, I promise I'll start looking through them tonight   <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />   And I'll be posting them to the site early next week.</td>
