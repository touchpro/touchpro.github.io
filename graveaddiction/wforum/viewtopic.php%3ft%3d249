<hr />
So I got me a new dog. Yeah, new... like he just rolled off the assembly line. He's still got that new puppy smell. And as soon as it's gone, I'll get one of those hanging tree air fresheners in &quot;new puppy&quot; smell and hang it from his neck.
<br />

<br />
Here's how it happened. I woke up yesterday feeling pretty good. I had no intentions of getting a dog. I had no intentions of having another pet period. I got two rats, and they're pretty good at taking up my time. But of course they're female, and females have a tendency to do that.
<br />

<br />
So I was sitting at home and Pork Sausage calls me and tells me there are these two puppies that were standing outside his back door, whining and pawing at the door. He let them in and fed them and watered them... much like a plant.
<br />

<br />
He decides he's going to keep one. The significance of this is, he's already got a wife, three kids, 89 cats, and a hamster. Like he needed something else. But he asked me if I could take care of one and I said there's no way. If you read this from the beginning, you already know that's a lie.
<br />

<br />
So he tells me he's going to call the SPCA and have them pick the other one up. That pissed me off. Not that he'd do that, because what do you do in that situation? It pisded me off because I can't let a dog go to the SPCA. As great as an organization as they are, it's like dog prison, where everyone's on death row. So what if noboday came to get this dog? He'd be put to sleep. I can't think of that. But what if someone does pick him up and they treat him like shit and beat him? I can't think of that either.
<br />

<br />
His wife had already called, so I told him I'd call him back. Since I live with my grandmother, I figured I should ask her. So I did. She tells me she doesn't want another animal in the house. I explain to her the above paragraph. She says I can take it in, but if it doesn't work I have to get rid of it. I agree, and call Pork back to tell him I'll take the fucking dog. Keep in mind that I know myself that I can't take care of a dog. Not that I'm incapable, but that I just don't have the time or funds. His wife calls the SPCA and cancels.
<br />

<br />
I go to the pet store and drop what money I had left until payday, which is in 5 days, on dog crap. Cage, treats, food, blah blah blah, and I go to get him.
<br />

<br />
As soon as I seen him I fell in love with him. He's a little black lab, probably around 3-5 months old. Then again, I can't tell a dog's age for shit, so he's probably a few weeks old. In any case, this is what they explain to me.
<br />

<br />
Pork's wife, Mrs. Sausage, tells me she was walking them and she ran into a neighbor of theirs and he told them that it was his neighbor that was putting the dogs out. Apparently he had put them out a few days before that and they've just been wandering around. He was going to call the SPCA himself until he seen Mrs. Sausage with them. She told him the dogs will be taken care of and he told her that he seen nothing.
<br />

<br />
So that's where we're at. They were abandoned, and now split apart, but at least they're in good homes.
<br />

<br />
Last night made me question my decision though. The first piss he took was outside, which was good. The next 4 were inside, which was bad. The worst part was he was up until 11:40 last night, whining from inside the cage and barking. I explain to him that I have to be at work in just over 5 hours. He didn't care. Luckily the &quot;tantrum&quot; only lasted for about 20 minutes.
<br />

<br />
I woke up this morning, let him out before he shit on my bed which he was very close to doing, and he did his business outside. It's too fucking early to be dealing with that shit!
<br />

<br />
The good news is, he's made me happy. All in all, he's made me happy. So far. But he's been a good dog. We wrestled a little bit last night and he has some spunk in him. And some attitude, which is just going to have to go.
<br />

<br />
As soon as I can I'll take pictures of the little beast and post them. He's cute. All black with a little white spot on his chest. I named him Angus after the best guitarist ever, Angus Young. I also told him that he better learn to play lead guitar within the next year or he's fired.
<br />

<br />
So that's it. I have a puppy now. Hopefully it'll work out, but if it doesn't I won't have a problem giving him to a good family. But not the SPCA.</td>

Puppies are very fun.
<br />

<br />
Mine just got fixed on Monday. She should be trying to recover, but no, she's a freaking ball of psycho energy.
<br />

<br />
The kitten got fixed yesterday and should be returning to my parents' house at any time.
<br />

<br />
My parents have decided that the pup and kitten are their new babies since they're officially empty nesters and they spent a ridiculous amount of money on the pets the other day.</td>

It's great that you didn't let the puppy end up at a shelter (good or bad). I won't even leave our dogs at a boarding place because it seems like a prison. I couldn't stick the dogs in prison then go on a cruise. I'd feel guilty. My in-laws do it all the time with their dog but there is no way I could.
<br />

<br />
One of our dogs (Oscar) just turned 7 years old yesterday so he got several new toys and treats. We have 3 dogs and they are incredibly spoiled but very well behaved. We had 3 huge boxes of just dog toys alone when we moved in December. They all 3 have their own dog beds. We have health insurance coverage for them through my wife's employer because when you have that many dogs if one gets sick they all usually get sick and it can get expensive. With one dog it may not make sense but with multiple dogs it's definetly worth it. Only $60/month for all 3 and one trip to the vet is usually around $40 each minimum. Sure I bitched and complained about getting it  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />  but my wife was right...it is worth it.</td>

Nice....  don't let my wife see that picture.  She'll be begging me for another animal to add to the clan.  She's a sucker for lost puppy dogs.

(She says that's why she married me, but I don't believe it for a minute.  I know it was for my money  <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />       You know... all the money I was paying on my car loan, my student loan, my credit cards.  She knew that someday those things would all be paid off and I could spend that money on her.  Heheheh...

Thanks. Yeah, he's a good pup. He has a long way to go though with the training. He's still pissing me off. I just have to learn to take it in stride. He doesn't know any better. But things are going ok. Things would be going great if he'd quit pissing and shitting on the floor...

You want him?
<br />

<br />
I'm giving him up. I was really hoping it would work, and I do love him. He really is a good dog and I'm sad just thinking about getting rid of him. But my stress is already high all the time, and he's making it worse. I don't have the time or patience to deal with him and training him now.
<br />

<br />
I was going to suffer thru it all for his sake, but last night is what broke that deal.
<br />

<br />
He's keeping me from getting sleep. Sleep is one thing I truly cherish, and he's not letting me get any. That has to stop. So I put an ad in the paper and hopefully someone will be able to take him off of my hands.
<br />

<br />
Like I said, I'll be sad to see him go, but he deserves to be in a home where someone can train him right and give him the attention he deserves.</td>

Our youngest dog is 4 and she pisses me off all the time STILL so if you can't handle it now it's probably best to find someone who can. I respect that decision...knowing it was most likely a difficult one to make.</td>

So difficult in fact that I called the paper and had them pull the ad. I can't give him up. I love the little bastard too much. I mean, it was tearing at me all morning, and when I talked to the lady at the paper and she said it was fine to pull the ad, I teared up from happiness. That told me something.
<br />

<br />
So, he's still my dog. Plus, I can still say my dog's cuter than Mynx's lol.</td>

Amazing how easily you get attached to the little buggers, isn't it?
<br />

<br />
A miracle has happened in our house; my dad likes the cat. I adopted a kitten back in September, which prompted the parents to go get a pup, since they said we had to raise them together.
<br />

<br />
I'll theoretically be getting a place of my own in June and was talking about bringing my cat down here...dad decided I'm not allowed to take *his* kitty. Besides, she and the pup don't do well when they're separated. They mope and whine and get upset.</td>
