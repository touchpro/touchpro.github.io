<hr />
Sam was a good kid, who basically always did what he was told and he never tried to get in trouble. If he did do something wrong, he usually confessed to it right away and never lied. John was a good friend of his who lived right around the corner and was basically the same as Sam. They hung out all the time and never did anything wrong.
<br />

<br />
When Summer came they were almost inseperable, and if you didn't find them at one of their houses, you found them at the other. At night they'd walk around the streets, as the neighborhood wasn't too bad and they just enjoyed it. Well, that's what Sam thought. You see, Sam didn't know that John's house was haunted. And John made any excuse he could to get out of the house at night.
<br />

<br />
One night as they were walking around, they came back to John's house and went inside to find John's 1 year old nephew standing up on his own in his crib watching TV by himself and laughing at the show. Not only was the show a drama, but John remembered turning the TV off before we left the house. Of course, someone could've turned it on, but it looked as if his nephew was being held up in the crib!
<br />

<br />
Sam also had problems. His family was breaking apart and he felt like an outsider at times. Plus, his house seemed haunted too, and he didn't want to be there at night. His house was actually worse than John's was, so he tried to stay at John's most nights, where as John just wanted to get out of his own house. So that's why they walked the streets.
<br />

<br />
The one thing about the town that they lived in was, almost the whole thing seemed haunted. It was called the &quot;City on a City&quot; at times, because it was believed to be true that there was a city there at one time and either a strong earthquake or a bad fire took out the whole city and everyone in it, and the city that they lived in was built on top of that.
<br />

<br />
So a lot of houses around the area seemed to be haunted, maybe a little more than should've been for an area like that, and that's what everyone thought happened.
<br />

<br />
Sam and John didn't know if this is what caused what happened one night, or if it was other reasons. All they do know is, to this day they still can't explain it.
<br />

<br />
One night as they were walking around, John started telling Sam about some more crazy things going on in his house, and that he thought he believed he knew who was in his house making noises at night.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I swear Sam, I heard them talking&quot; John said looking around as if he didn't want anyone to hear.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So what were they saying?&quot; Sam asked.
<br />

<br />
&quot;At first I couldn't make anything out, and it sounded like many voices...
<br />
I thought someone broke in. So I went downstairs as quietly as possible and I looked around and didn't see anyone there. But the voices were still there. That's when I heard...&quot; John stopped and looked around again.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Sam said as he grew more impatient with the story.
<br />

<br />
&quot;It turned out to be only two voices. And they kept calling each other's name and talking about a race. I went upstairs and got in bed and was awake all night. I don't know if they were there and I couldn't see them or what...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Wow. So what were their names?&quot; Sam asked in awe.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I know the one said Eddie. I'm not sure about the other one, but I can swear Eddie called him Sticks.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;So what about the race?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; John answered, &quot;but they said something about it being on Friday night.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sam then realized it was Friday night and he wondered what exactly the race was supposed to be.
<br />

<br />
John and Sam started to walk up another street towards their homes when they were pulled into an alley. They both screamed and they then felt hands placed over their mouths. In what light there was, they could see two guys with leather jackets on, slicked back hair, and the one was chewing a toothpick. Then the first one spoke.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey Eddie, what do you think we should do to em?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Both boys knew exactly who they were looking at. They must've broken into John's house that night!
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't know Stix, maybe we should take em with us for the race? How about we just finish em here?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me Eddie...&quot;
<br />

<br />
And it was at that point that John kicked Stix in the crotch and as Stix loosened his grip John ran. Eddie turned to run after John and when he did Sam took off the other way.
<br />

<br />
They could hear both guys yelling after them as they ran. Sam cut thru some yards and ran into John in another alley.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Did you lose him?&quot; Sam asked. Just as he did, they heard tires squealing and looked back towards where the sound was coming from. All they could see was lights coming at them.
<br />

<br />
They both started to run when Sam suddenly felt like he was pushed out of the way. He fell off to the side of the alley and he could see the car go by him. It looked like an old hot rod that he used to see at those car shows his dad would take him to. Then he looked to see if John got out of the way too, and he hadn't. He was still being chased by the car!
<br />

<br />
Sam started to run towards them as fast as he could, but John was a much faster runner than Sam and the car was obviously faster as well.
<br />

<br />
John ran and ran, and he could feel the bumper of the car on his heels. He turned a corner and everything went quiet. Suddenly there were no lights, and there was no engine. He turned around, still running, and realized nobody was there.
<br />

<br />
Wondering if it was all in his head, he started to feel a little weird as the night was quiet and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then he heard the noise again, and it was coming from the other way. He started to run again as what seemed to be another car was now coming after him. John ran as hard as he could, though he was feeling tired at this point. The car got closer and closer until again he could feel it right behind him. As they got towards the end of the ally John noticed it was a dead end. Not having anywhere to turn, he threw himself up against the back of someone's garage that was at the end of the alley and he turned around to look at the car. The lights grew closer as the car speeded down the alley towards him and he tightened up as to expect the worst. Then the car hit him... but it went thru him and thru the garage. And all at once it was quiet again.
<br />

<br />
Sam caught up with him and asked what happened to the car.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So you did see it too?&quot; John asked Sam.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Sam answered, &quot;it was an old hot rod. I followed you as far as I could.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I was thrown to the side, like someone grabbed me and threw me, but as soon as I was knocked out of the way I looked and seen the car go by and there was nobody there to throw me out of the way. Where did the car go?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sam finally realized everything was back to normal.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't know, it just kind of disappeared!&quot;
<br />

<br />
They both looked around for a few seconds, trying to figure out what happened. Sam noticed John was a little dazed and he didn't say much.
<br />

<br />
As they started to walk back towards the house, not saying anything, Sam finally asked John if he was ok. John still looked dazed, and he didn't answer Sam.
<br />

<br />
Almost towards the end of the street they heard tires squealing again. As they turned around they could see two cars racing towards them. Sam looked at John and John had a look of horror on his face. They both turned to run and Sam instantly tripped and fell in the road. John was running towards his house.
<br />

<br />
As the noise of the engines got closer Sam looked up and could see the cars past him and heading towards John. Had the cars actually drove over him? He wasn't sure, but he knew that there was no way they could've swerved as they were side by side.
<br />

<br />
John ran and ran saying out loud as he ran &quot;Please no!&quot;, almost begging them to stop. As he got closer to his house he felt a shock of fear come over him and the lights of the cars surrounded him.
<br />

<br />
Today John is in a psychiatric ward. He still says they torment him. He doesn't know why and they won't say. At night he hears the engines and the two men screaming and laughing. He'll never be released.
<br />

<br />
Sam moved to another city with his family as things with his house got too weird and they had to move out. He's never experienced Eddie and Stix since that night. Sam visited John once in the hospital, but John didn't even act like he recognized Sam, so Sam left and never went back. John was his best friend, and he always will be. But the sight of him in the hospital is just too much. Sam thinks about him all the time.</td>
