As some of you may know, I work in real estate. I need to complain for a couple of minutes about these people who are suing Dominion Homes <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
We live in a Dominion Home that was just completed in December out here between Westerville and New Albany. We couldn't be happier with them and with the quality of our house. What ticks me off about these people who have been in our major newspaper repeatedly is that they can't expect a homebuilder to do their &quot;homework&quot; for them. We had to sit down and figure out whether or not we could afford our house before signing the contract. Dominion layed out in great detail what our options were and ALL of the things we should take into consideration. My wife and I are big on information, especially me, when making a decision. It took us six months to finally decide to buy through Dominion. We looked at every builder in town and they came out on top. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. 
<br />

<br />
No house is guranteed to rise in value. Maybe our house won't raise in value but to the best of my knowledge we have the potential to make a nice profit off this place. Just like when buying stocks you figure out your potential for return on your investment and if it's to your liking you buy the stock. Unfortunately the value of that stock or in this case house may NOT rise in value...it may actually decline even though its virtually new. The location, quality of schools, and other things unrelated to your home itself determines it's value. The amount you pay in taxes is based on an ESTIMATE of the value of your home, which in most cases is actually less than what you could sell it for. Also, the market plays a part in determining the value of your house. Right now here in central Ohio there is no housing shortage like there was in the 50's and 60's. We are selling record numbers of homes but the inventory of available homes has also increased substantially in the past 3 years. The economy in our area has slowed from where it was in the 90's so we're not growing as fast as we were. The trendy areas like German and Victorian Village aren't even selling as well as they had been probably due to overinflated prices for the existing market. 
<br />

<br />
My top 5 list of imporant &quot;homework&quot; to do when buying a house:
<br />

<br />
1. Quality of Schools...this one his HUGE. You may not have any kids but if you want the value of your house to die FAST vote against school levies. A lot of people are considering moves out of Westerville right now because of the amount of cutbacks they've made the past few years. 
<br />

<br />
2. What is in the area...a landfill or industrial areas will really hurt the re-sale value of your house. You want to be especially careful of this when building a house. The cost of building is based on materials and labor not re-sale value. You better not build a new house in Obetz and expect a huge return on your investment. It doesn't happen down there. Another poor re-sale area is the Southwest side of Columbus.
<br />

<br />
3. What am I building this house for? Am I going to be here long-term or short term. If you're not going to be there long you'd better build somewhere that is &quot;in-demand&quot; right now because it's not likely to go out of demand in less than 5 years. It sometimes takes people a while to figure out when something is &quot;out of style&quot; you see them all the time sporting bad mullets or leather pants <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
4. What do I want to pay....NOT what can I afford because you can always qualify for a lot more loan than you should want. Look at how much you want to have tied up in house payments. Don't forget that you're going to need money for the bills and upkeep associated with a house (even if it's new).
<br />

<br />
5. Taxes, Don't forget when building a house that real estate taxes are paid &quot;in arrears&quot; which means you pay it after you actually owe it. When you build a house you're only paying real estate taxes on vacant land the first year you're there. If you pay your taxes as part of your house payment make it so that you're payment is based on what the estimate of taxes on both the house and land together will be so you don't get a big surprise year 2 (of a $500+ rise in your house payment). The money goes into an escrow account so you'll have a surplus your first year if you do this. You won't lose the money.
<br />

<br />
Finally, in conclusion...if you screw up and your house doesn't rise in value don't blame the builder, take it on the chin and do a better job next time. These people are smart enough to figure out how to file a lawsuit yet not smart enough to get help in figuring out buying a house...good grief <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Take a buyers' agent with you. They can help you and most builders will pay their commission. It costs you NOTHING.</td>

I'll throw in my two cents...
<br />

<br />
When buying a house, get the &quot;Keep up with the Joneses&quot; mentality out of your head... especially your first home.  We bought our first house after three years of apartment living.  I know we drove the realtor nuts, cuz he musta showed us 30-40 homes.
<br />

<br />
Anyhow, we found a nice starter home that was only 9 years old.  Good neighborhood, and we kept our payment at a very reasonable amount.  All that to make this point... we've been able to furnish and do renovations without racking up a bunch of debt cuz we don't have an outrageous house payment.  I have friends who literally have nothing but a card table and chairs in their gorgeous, expensive homes that they probably bought way too early.  N-A makes a great point...  most lenders will tell you that you can afford a lot more house.  They don't tell you that you have to live on Mac-n-cheese until you pay the thing down.  My wife and I worked out our budget and decided we could comfortably afford $xxx a month for a house payment.  We sat down with our realtor and said here's what we can pay, tell us how much house we can buy.
<br />

<br />
It didn't hurt that we found a house that had been a HUD repo...  I can do a lot of handy-work, so I've done a lot of renovations to the house and built our equity up very quickly.
<br />

<br />
Do your homework and have a plan!  Our plan is to live here for another three years, get the equity up.  Hopefully we'll buy a few acres of land and then build on it.</td>

Good advice!!

This lawsuit seems to fit in with most these days - people never want to take any responsibility for their own actions anymore.  Let's blame someone else and sue!  It drives me crazy.</td>

I'm about to start working as a buyers' agent for a Real Estate Company here in Columbus in addition to my real estate marketing/support business. I've been training for what seems like forever. I used to think it was a waste of time to use a buyers' agent until I went through all of the training and realized the expertise they can bring to the table for FREE. It's actually a huge benefit and costs you nothing as long as the listing agent or builder is willing to do a co-op (pay their commission). Buying a house is a huge investment so use a buyers' agent, especially if it's your first house. Almost every real estate company has them now. They'll guide you through each step of the process to make sure you aren't being taken advantage of. They work for you not the seller, unlike the listing agent who works for the seller. With that being said it's still very important for you to do your homework with financing and budgeting.
<br />

<br />
Also, from what I've heard from other real estate professionals this whole lawsuit is the result of a feud between two wealthy families one of which builds homes and the other who prints news. If you look into it the whole thing really makes no sense, in that all the other builders in town do exactly the same things. It's no secret now and it never has been. Everybody does zero down financing these days and down payment assistance. The lenders come up with this stuff not the builders.</td>

<hr />
I have a friend who is a realtor, and she thanks you for being smart enough to realize that parts of the process require some leg work.
<br />

<br />
She deals mostly with resort homes and stuff in Hide-A-Way Hills, but she printed your post and it lives in her little home office. She also has a copy she's giving to one of her new clients, because, in her opinion, they're dumb.
<br />

<br />
Loki and I have been working out our budgets just for apartments, and it's obvious based on our friends' reactions to our budgets that none of them have ever dealt with money on any scale larger than buying themselves new clothes. One of our friends was looking over our budget and flipped out because we could afford to rent a very nice townhome in Athens. He didn't take into account the utility bills, a food budget, or paying for gas to commute to class, as the townhomes are too far away to walk. Not to mention the renters' insurance. No wonder so many college students and young couples end up in financial trouble. I want my only debt out of college to be my damned student loans.</td>
