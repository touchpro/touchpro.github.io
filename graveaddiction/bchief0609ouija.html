On June 30, 2009 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This ouija story was given to me by a friend of mine who did several sessions communicating with a friend of his who said went to hell. This is his email to me, word for word in his own words...
<br><br>
I'll tell you what he told me. His name is Drew and he was a gang member from my area that died and went to hell.   He said that it is very dark and smoldering hot where he is.  He told me that the ouija board is an oracle designed to talk to the residents in hell and that some spirits may be good souls that were banished to hell for not believing in God, but most of the spirits are bad spirits faking it and trying to seem good.  Since my uncle knew him, he was telling me about this on multiple occasions.
<br><br>
From what he has told me, there are 3 stages after death.  There is heaven (gods palace), limbo (our world - you are stuck here to haunt something till you move on), and hell (satans palace). I don't know,  he said that it was too complicated to explain, but he is in hell and at the same time he is in the room with me.  He said that he can be in 2 places at one time...He would warn us of demons that are coming through and said that the ouija board is a portal to hell.  They are still in hell, but half of them are in your home. That is how evil spirits are released through oracles.
<br><br>
He told me that hell is forever, and when he first went there he was in dark nothing with light shining on him.  The light started closing and souls began to grab him and bite and suck his flesh.  He screamed for mercy, but his actions were unforgivable.  He said that when you go to hell, damned souls will grab you and drag you down while ripping you apart, but of course he paraphrased it lol. He said there is no getting out of hell.  You're trapped there for good, but he said the devil allows some demons to leave so that they can damn souls.
<br><br>
On several sessions, Drew said he had to go because his friends were calling him and he was drinking corona's (a beer).  I found that odd that you can drink current time beers in hell?  He even talked to me while he was drunk on the board, and you could tell he was drunk because he couldn't spell for shit. He saved my uncle one time, because my uncle is a gang member too and he told him not to go outside on a certain day.  My uncle didn't believe him.   My uncle sat on a plastic chair outside, then I said, &quot;Drew, if you're there give us a sign.&quot; So he grabbed the chair and pulled it out from under my uncle. We went in scared, and later that day there was a drive by and my uncle's house was shot up.  He only lived because of Drew.
<br><br>
He said that they can read your mind, and they can either touch things or use their minds to move it.  He said he can't throw anything around unless we talk to him and give him energy to do so. Also, all of them can see into the future, but they are not allowed to say much in fear of the big man.  He said that if he said anything about the future, the devil would do something.  And when I would ask him what, he would just repeat SAVE ME, SAVE ME, SAVE ME, SATAN, SATAN, SATAN. He was very afraid.
<br><br>
He would warn us and would say go to church, satan is coming, so we were scared.  He said that the more we talk to him the more power we give him.  There was once a spirit who was pretending to be Drew, and Drew came back and he told me something that amazed me.  We told him what happened and he said, and I quote, &quot;hold on - ill be back ima go kick his ass.&quot;  He came back, and he said he whooped his ass.  One time my dad was saying that shit isn't real, Drew is a nobody.  Drew got mad and threw the board to the ground and said leave now, he said he was going to slit my fathers throat and kill him.  I got on my knees and begged him to let my father be because he is ignorant.  And he said RUN he is coming.   We asked who was coming, and he said over and over again SATAN SATAN SATAN SATAN SATAN SATAN.  So we stopped and left the board out on the porch.  He would predict who would die next from a shoot out and was always correct.   He also said he raped people in hell and he was also raped in hell by a mightier spirit.
<br><br>
During one session, he told us to change the channel to one where it had static.  He said turn on music so you can see me dance.  We did, and the statics were jumping up and down to the music, and that blew my mind. He said that most of the time he gets drunk in hell, but he says most of his time in hell is being tourtured by demons and Satan himself.  He said he looked at his face, he's looking in the face of satan, and he told me that it is the most horrifying thing that you will ever see .  He began to cry. A grown man who lived on the streets killing began to cry like a baby. Every time I ask him what does Satan look like, he starts repeating his name and says he is crying so it must be crazy scary.
<br><br>
He also mentioned a demon's name that he is afraid of.   He told me not to say his name out loud, but it was cool to write it down.  He said his name is &quot;Zetoh,&quot; and he is a pretty big baddy.  He told me to stop talking him and he said hell is a place, a dark place and it is fiery hot.  It looks like a dark fiery earth. He joked and said that they weren't kidding about the brimstones of fire and the lake of fire - its all true.  He told me to follow god so I don't ever have to see what he has seen.  To answer your question on what hell is like, it looks like a battle zone on fire.  He said it is worse than anyone can imagine, your brain can't even comprehend how horrific it is.
