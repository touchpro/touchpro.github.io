On May 16, 2003 Christian, John, Karen, Ryan, and myself used the Ouija board at my great grandparents'/great uncle's old abandoned house.  Don, Jim, Katy, and Nancy watched.  The session was ended a little abruptly after 21 minutes and 59 seconds, read on and you'll find out why...


<br><br>
Beth: Are there any spirits in the room with us?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>
Beth: Can you tell us who it is?<br>
Board: Brigit

<br><br>
John: Do we know who you are?<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

Ryan: Do you know anyone who we know?<br>
Board: Harold

<br><br>

Beth: What year were you here?<br>
Board: Never

<br><br>

Karen: Brigit, are you a spirit guide?<br>
Board: No (<i>At this point Jim told us that he read some letters from a lady named Brigit to Harold when he was helping clean out the house</i>)


<br><br>

Karen: Brigit, are you from Long Island New York?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Karen: Brigit, did you know Harold?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Beth: Were you his friend?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Beth: Is that why you're visiting tonight, because you're friends with Harold?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

John: Is there something you want to tell us Brigit?<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

Christian: Thank you Brigit.<br>

<br><br>

Christian: Can you give me another clue?<br>
Board: DRF

<br><br>

Christian: Brigit, are those initials or are you trying to spell a word?<br>
Board: Trying

<br><br>

Christian: You're trying to spell something for me, correct?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Christian: Brigit, is this message for me?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Christian: Is this message from you or Alexander?  If it's from you it would be yes.<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

Ryan: Is it an important message?<br>
Board: Yes


<br><br>

Beth: Want to try one more time?<br>
Board: Job

<br><br>

Christian: Is this something to happen?<br>
Board: Need One

<br><br>

John: Does Christian need a job?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>

Christian: But Brigit, why are you telling me that?  Is it really from you or from Alexander?<br>
Board: Me

<br><br>

Christian: Is there another message for me?<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

<br><br>

Beth: Harold, where did the tombstone come from?  Did you find it or was it already here?<br>

Board: Yes

<br><br>

Beth: Is the body buried here?<br>
Board: No

<br><br>

Beth: Can you tell us where it's buried, you know, maybe a city?<br>

<br><br>

Beth: Why is it here, is it family?<br>
Board: Yes

<br><br>
