On October 3, 2008 I received an e-mail from Gia about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>


When Lacey and I went to look at log cabins in New Hampshire, America we went to a house that we thought was beautiful.  Then we looked around, and it was kind of weird.  We went inside and it was so cold, and orbs were everywhere, so Lacey and I looked outside.  We saw a well, so we asked my parents if we could go see it.  We did, and there were bricks and dirt piled up. So we walked away, and then Lacey saw a woman with brown hair, pink pants, and a pink hairband.  The woman said, &quot;Come here.&quot; I blinked, and it was gone. So then we ran into my car, my parents were still in the house. After that house we went back to Vermont and did this:
<br><br>
Lacey: May we speak to the ghost of the house in New Hampshire, America?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Gia: Who are you?<br>
Board: Mom<br>
<br>
Lacey: Was that house your's?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Gia: Are you good?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lacey: If you are here...<br>
Gia: make it cold.<br>
Board: Ok<br>
<br>
(it suddenly got a little cold, believe it or not)<br>
<br>
Gia: Do you have short brown hair, pink pants, and a pink hairband?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lacey: Why did you want us to hurry inside?<br>
Board: Man<br>
<br>
(it suddenly gets a lot warmer)<br>
<br>
Gia: What do you mean, man?<br>
Board: kler<br>
<br>
Lacey: Do you mean (she was scared to say it) killer?<br>
Board: y-e-s (spells it out...didn't go to yes)<br>
<br>
Gia: Was he chasing or following someone? Is that why you said to hurry inside?<br>
Board: Kids, yes<br>
<br>
Lacey: Your kids?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Gia: Me and Lacey?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Gia: Did you die before this day?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lacey: Did the killer die before this day too?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lacey: Why was he chasing us?<br>
Board: House well<br>
<br>
Gia: Do you mean we went in his house?<br>
Lacey: And looked in his grave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
GOODBYE
