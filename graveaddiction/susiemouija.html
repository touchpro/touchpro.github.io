On May 7, 2007 I received an e-mail from Susie M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Several of my friends and I recently bought a oujia board, so we've been eager to use it whenever. We decided to use it in the basement of our dormitory (as we're all in college), just to see what would happen.
<br><br>
There were five of us, and at first we were talking to someone named Ted. The planchette was moving somewhat fast, and after I had asked how it was, it moved even faster. The words it was spelling were complete gibberish, and before we could ask it to repeat, this extremely loud noise came out of nowhere, scaring the hell out of us. We all panicked, and ran.
<br><br>
One of my friends was too scared from that experience to continue, and went up to her room. The rest of us tried it again, and we were all still very shaken up from the noise. We asked if someone was there, and it moved to yes. When we asked who it was, it just said &quot;friend.&quot; It kept saying &quot;friend&quot; throughout the entire time we talked to us- I think it was trying to reassure us that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, my friend asked it if it had been the one to make the noise, and it had said &quot;no.&quot; Then we asked if it had been the furnace or something like that which had made the noise, and it said &quot;yes.&quot; After that, we all calmed down a bit.
<br><br>
I was curious to see how old it was, so I asked. It's answer was &quot;forever.&quot; This confused me, so I asked if it was a ghost, and it said &quot;no.&quot; It didn't say what it was, just that it had been around forever. I have no clue what we talked to, but I'm thinking that it was some sort of earthen spirit or something, something that had been around since the begining of time.
<br><br>
We asked more questions, and gathered that it was a female who wanted to talk to all of us. She said she could tell the future, so of couse we asked some silly things. It said my one friend would &quot;quit happy&quot; if he moved to Texas, and that my other friend would be a photographer, but that it would be &quot;tough.&quot; She didn't know if my friend had any siblings beyond the ones she was aware of. I asked her if she knew if anything good would happen to me in November (something is going to happen then, that none of my friends were aware of), and the response I got was &quot;fly&quot;- this got me super excited, because something is going to happen in November having to do with someone flying.
<br><br>
The whole time, the planchette was moving very fast and pretty powerfully; I really think I was talking to something much more powerful than a ghost, which I find totally neat.
