On August 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Yannick about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Hello, My name is Yannick and I am quite new to playing with an ouija board. My friend kyle and I bought a Ouija board and started playing with it today. At first it didn't work and we were like &quot;Well this is boring.&quot; Then, after a few
minutes, it started moving! My friend and I thought we were pushing the planchette, but after awhile we were convinced that we weren't.
<br><br>
Now, we talked to 3 of 4 suspected people. First was Matt, He seemed nice.  We got quite a bit of information from him about himself and such.
<br><br>
Next, we talked to what could have been my grandmother. When we asked for her name, she gave her initials. Then, I asked when she died, and she said 1957...I was shocked!  That was when she died (she died while my father was being born).
<br><br>
Then we talked to a person we call alphabet. He would only answer yes or no questions.  When we asked questions that needed letters, he would go A,M,B,L,C,K,D,J,E,I,F,H,G...Is this something I should be afraid of? A lot of the times he would joke around, and at first he seemed quite cool. Then he started joking around too much. He started going back and forth, pointing at the letters. A lot of times he kept circling the board and then it'd go super fast...We had to tell it to stop.
<br><br>
He never did a figure 8.  This is where it gets odd though.  We kept saying goodbye and leaving the board for awhile.  Then when we came back, it would be alphabet again. He would start going back and forth with the letters and circling around. We decided to move rooms. When we tried playing, it would be alphabet again. We begged him to let us talk to somebody else but he would stay on the board...
