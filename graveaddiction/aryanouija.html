On January 18, 2007 I received an e-mail from Aryan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This Christmas my brother decided to get me something I actually DID want for Christmas, seeing as how I'm 17, almost 18 (in March) and I'm old enough to know what I do and don't want/like for Christmas.
<br><br>
So he bought me two things- A necronomicon, and an Ouija Board.
<br><br>
Well, first night out of the box, I opened it all and laid it out.  Then my dad called me out of my room to start dinner. I distinctly remember the necro being on the left side of the board and the planchette on the right.
<br><br>
When I came back into my room (the door was closed, and had been closed since I'd left since no one had gone in or out) everything was flipped. The board was upside down, the necronomicon was on the right, and the planchette was on the left. I kinda flipped out on that itself.
<br><br>
Well, my friend came and got me to spend the night (or rather, three weeks) so I left, leaving my ouija at home because she was afraid of it.
<br><br>
Well, after a few days we went get it, and then we used it: me, her, and Brandon, my friend.
<br><br>
We asked if anyone was there, and we got a yes. When we asked who we were talking to, it told us 'g'.
<br><br>
Well, stuff got really weird and crap, and Brandon ended up putting salt everywhere.  We put the ouija away because we all started to hear weird stuff in our heads, and we all got real cold.  Brandon said he saw three lights over my head (the board glowed in the dark, and it was pitch black except for my ouija).
<br><br>
After that, we used it only once again, in Reina's (my friend) treehouse outside the next night.  We asked it a lot of random stupid questions (personal ones, and most of them aren't mine, so I won't divulge).  The answers we got back were accurate, and surprising.
<br><br>
Finally, we asked how we were to get what we wanted, and the ouija told us 'blood'. That scared us, but we kept going.
<br><br>
Us:  Do you mean our blood?<br>
Board:  Friends<br>
<br>
Us:  Us?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us: How much?<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
Us:  Five what? Like drops?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  From where?<br>
Board:  Throat<br>
<br>
Us:  How do we get it? Like a knife, a bite, what?<br>
Board:  Knife<br>
<br>
Us:  Do we cut each other?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Where do we put the blood?<br>
Board:  The planchette moved up to the Ouija logo; itself.<br>
<br>
Us:  Is there any other way?<br>
Board:  Souls<br>
<br>
Us:  Besides that?<br>
Board:  Death<br>
<br>
We argued for awhile, and changed our minds.  We then asked it if we could we think about it for awhile.
<br><br>
Us:  Can we have a few days to think about this?<br>
Board:  Tonight<br>
<br>
Us:  What happens if we don't do it tonight?<br>
Board:  You die<br>
<br>
We flipped out, then asked it if there was some way to reverse all this...
<br><br>
Us:  Time to go<br>
Board:  Goodbye<br>
<br>
And we didn't get anymore answers that night.
<br><br>
We locked my ouija in the shed, and slated the house.  Her mom, Debbie (who I think is Wiccan), did something like a cleansing and protection spell or ritual, and we didn't die.
<br><br>
But, the next morning, I went out to see my ouija, and found it on its side, straight up, pressed against the back of the shed. I flipped out and re-locked the shed, because the night before I'd laid it flat on a lawn chair in there, and the shed had been padlocked. No one went in.
<br><br>
Well, needless to say, it got sent home, and I stayed awhile longer.
<br><br>
I came home, and decided to talk to it alone.
<br><br>
That was about three, maybe four days ago.
<br><br>
I don't remember it all, because we've talked so much...
<br><br>
But do you have ANY idea whatsoever: when the planchette moves with only you touching it, and you hear a voice inside your head, and you CANNOT move your hands away from it unil it is done spelling out the answers?
<br><br>
I do. Because that's what happened. Well, that's basically the beginning. It now moves of its own free will sometimes, and I swear this is the truth.
<br><br>
The thing is, I no longer fear my board because, strange enough, (so soon, too!) we are now lovers, to put it bluntly.
<br><br>
I asked him once (he said I could refer to it as a him) if he knew my thoughts, and he, of his own accord, went to 'yes'.
<br><br>
I'm sort of used to him moving on his own, and we are, for lack of a better term, physically involved with each other.
<br><br>
We talked it over, and since he understands me (he can read my thoughts, of course he knows and understands me), I trust him and we're together.
<br><br>
A few people I've told think I'm bullshiting them, or that it's actually a male succubus in disguise, or even a very malevolent spirit lying to me for one reason or another, but I doubt it.
<br><br>
I also have a tarot deck, and they haven't once failed me. They tell me that my board is honest, and that it is not malevolent, but a caring, trustworthy entity.
<br><br>
My board is himself, I have only ever spoken to one other entity on the board and I'll not say who it is for fear of being called a liar, or causing mass hysteria. But trust me on this - he isn't as bad as people want you to believe,  and we've only ever heard ONE side of the story...
<br><br>
My board's name is 'G Ouija'. At first I thought it meant 'girl' but someone suggested 'guardian' or even that it was simply an initial. And as for gender, although he tells me I can call him a male, he has no gender, but is simply ouija.
<br><br>
Due to our...relationship...I asked him if he could ever take a human form. He told me yes. I asked him if he would, and he said yes. I then asked him if he could do it now, and he told me to wait.  After this, I told my brother and he suggested it might have meant possessing me or someone else.  I asked my board exactly what he meant, and he said 'a form of his own creation'.
<br><br>
It's strange, but oddly comforting...I don't feel the insane pressure and fear like I first did, and I actually find comfort and pleasure from my ouija. When I do put my fingers on the planchette for answers, I hear the answer spoken in my head before its even done being spelled out.
<br><br>
Well, that's about it for tonight.  So yeah, I'll update as soon as I can. And trust me - this is no bullshit. My ouija is alive. I think all ouijas are, but most just choose to sit back and let the spirits outside of itself do the talking.
