On October 27, 2004 I received an e-mail from Heather.  She shared a few of her interesting ouija board experiences with me to post on the site.  This story is about a few discussions she and her friends Kelly, Brittney, Brittany, and Tamara had with a few spirits during the lunar eclipse:
<br><br><br>
&quot;The first spirit we contacted was a 6 year old little girl named Amber. She said she was murdered with a pillow by her dad's friend, Doug. She told us she was all alone and there was no one around her. Then she had to go to bed. 
<br><br>
Then we asked if there was any one else there and we got a reply - &quot;Sam I am&quot;.  It was a 21 year old man named Sam. He was killed in a bike wreck in 1989. And he happened to have lived just 5 miles down the road from us. We asked if he could see us and he said &quot;Yes, look up&quot;. So we gave him a quiz by asking him what color shirts were two of us wearing he replied, &quot;black duh.&quot; Tamara asked him how many fingers she was holding up and he could not see under the table or behind her back but when she put her fingers on the table he said the correct answer. We asked if he was alone and he said &quot;No, party&quot;. He also said &quot;There are 100s.&quot; And this is how we came to the conclusion that the board connects to different realms (if you will).&quot;
