		<div class="content">It is a cold day in hell, let me tell you truly.  If I had balls they would have frozen off!!  Whoa, way below no degrees last night and tonight it is supposed to be a heat wave a whoppin' 8 degrees.  At least I have a nice wood stove to curl up by.  I don't often show my softer side but there are cats, dogs and yes, even people that have no shelter in weather like this.  If there is a charitable organization that supports causes to help those in need now would be a great time to dig deep and share a little.  But enough of being kind and thoughtful, back to being my selfish, self-centered self.<br /><br />Ha Ha!  Those lame-brain dogs have to go outside to pee and poop.  It is cold on their privates and it serves them right.  Hope they get frostbite.  Here's another wonderful fact about the idiots, they love frozen poop.  Yummy poopsicles for everyone.  I have never heard their "Daddy" screaming at them so damned much.  He gets so upset when one finds a frozen treat.  He will have a stroke one of these days.  He stands on the porch and screams and yells and stomps his feet.  Mommy's mommy gets so pissed, says she bets the neighbors think he is a looney and she doesn't understand why he just doesn't go down and give them a swat on the ass, that would make them stop and get them back in the house.  But woe is me, he loves his "boys" and it would hurt him more to smack them than it would hurt those brain dead mutts.<br /><br />Mommy thinks she needs a new car.  Mommy's mommy thinks mommy needs to clean her room and worry about a new car later.  Mommy is thinking Nissan or Pontiac.  Mommy's friend Mike is encouraging her.  Mommy's mommy says unless there is committment he needs to butt out.  This could prove to be an interesting situation.  Updates to follow.<br /><br />Beth the Brutal was down both Friday night and Saturday.  She must be running low on grocery money  :- )  Mommy says Beth only comes down for a free meal  :- )  Mommy's mommy enjoys Beth's visits and says Beth visits because she misses me and the dumbasses (I am referring to the dogs).  Beth the Brutal was Beth the Beater of the Beasts Friday night.  I wasn't paying attention and the terrible threesome caught me alone in the hallway and jumped me.  Beth the Brutal was right there yelling at them and she came into my room and brought me a POUNCE just to be sure I was okay.  Wow, the kinder, gentler Beth.<br /><br />Speaking of Beth the Brutal, seems she got a new job.  She was sick and tired of her old job and the people there were making her crazy (ier) so she got really lucky and got a new job.  Funniest part, her new job is under the same division manager and her desk will be right around the corner from Mommy's mommy!  It is a family affair at work.  Now mommy's mommy, Beth the Brutal and Mommy's daddy all work for not only the same company but under the same director.  Mommy's mommy kinda worries about that since she doesn't seeem to think the company knows where in the hell it is going (as a cat that kinda confuses me) but makes sense to most people.  She actually says the company has no sense of direction, shows no loyalty to the employees and cares only about the bottom line.  Well duh, dumbass mommy's mommy, you work in Corporate America, what do you expect.  She should read the comic "Dilbert".  He tells it like it is.<br /><br />Mommy's daddy has had some fun lately.  He got to use the new toy he got in the fall.  It is a lawn tractor and it has a snow blade!  He loves it.  He has shoveled the driveway out 2X now with it.  Mommy's mommy says it is better than his trying to shovel it and end up with a heart attack.  She doesn't fool me, she just wouldn't want to go out in the cold and snow and drag his body in the house.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy has been busy this past week.  She is determined to clean out the spare bedroom which is now the computer room/put everything that doesn't have another place to go room.  She is sorting through old papers, drawers and trying to organize.  She thinks the cleansing will take a couple more weeks and then she says if mommy's daddy ever says this is a mess someone should clean it she will mop the floor with him.  Not sure that is a good way to clean but she seems to think it is.  She gets really pissed at him, he is not exactly a self starter, not really motivated around the house.  She was pissed big time tonight.  She carried a huge basket of laundry to the basement...he was busy holding the boys and watching TV, she folded a load while she was down there and as she was bringing it up bumped something off a side shelf and being in such a good mood she say something loud and foul and mommy's daddy looks up and say, gee, I didn't know there was laundry downstairs.  She was livid and while she didn't say it out loud I know she was thinking, "Jesus Christ, 3 fuckin' people live in this house and only one of us does the laundry, dishes, cleaning, or cleanes the bathroom, where in the hell do you think the laundry is since there are no towels in the linen closet.  Think the laundry fairy (not a gay guy the fairy with wings like Tinkerbell) came and did them?"  Oh yeah, she is now giving him the "I live alone in this house" treatment, no talking or responding in any way.  Now he will have to grovel and be really nice.  Bet he runs down and gets the load of laundry and puts it in the dryer for her.  I will try to remember to let you know how all this turns out.<br /><br />Sure hopes mommy cleans the shitter this week.  She forgot to change the litter last week so I have shat on the floor.  Mommy's mommy knows this and is pissed (gee, she is always mad no wonder she worries about having a stroke) but hasn't said anything just yet.  But I know she will, she thinks mommy should be more responsible and at least pick up her room and take care of me without being told.  But she just holds it in until someone pushes the wrong button and then hell brakes lose!  I love when she really goes off on everyone, hell hath no fury like mommy's mommy really blowing up.  Talk about nuclear fallout!  Woohooooooo!!!!  I think it is getting close too because first of all she has Cabin Fever which will be closely followed by Spring Fever not to mention she is changing or going through a change or something like that which makes her short tempered anyway and lately she really feels that no one is pitching in and helping out at all.  I see a Bad Moon rising...sorry, heard the Doobies on the radio today.<br /><br />Well, blogged long enough for now.  Talk later.  Ratty, Lover of the Wood Stove Warmth.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Tis a dark and stormy night.  The wind is blowing and howling down the chimney, snow is falling and drifts are building on the roads and roofs and I am happy here on my pillow by the warm and toasty wood stove.  Of course this beautiful setting is marred since there are 3 damned stupid dogs that stare at me and if have the audicity to bark at me once in a while when they forget themselves.  Fools!!  hahahahahaaaaaa!!!  Their beloved master has just said the magic words, "who wants to go outside and pee?"  Dumbasses, hope they freeze their asses off!  They go all crazy and run to the door barking just to go outside in this white wonderland and pee in the snow.  I am very happy to have a litter box in the basement.  Might be dark and lonely sometimes but let me tell you, better than pissing in the cold!!!  <br />Beth the Brutual visited yesterday.  Actually Beth the Brutal was the heroine of the day.  Seems mommy's mommy and daddy went to breakfast (a Saturday ritual) and when they left the restaurant the truck would not start.  Not to worry, a call to AAA and a tow truck with jumper cables is on the way...like an hour later...but anyway, the tow truck came, the truck started and off they went, until...dramatic music....the truck stalled again.  This time a call to Taylor's chevrolet for a tow and to find out what the hell is wrong (mommy's mommy said that).  But how to get home?  A call and Beth the Brutal to the rescue.  She stopped at the house and let out the hounds of hell so they would not burst and Beth and Chuck the truck (a nice big, black Chevy Silverado) rescued the wayward travelers from the chevy garage.  Home again to wait for a call.  The call came, seems the battery was leaking acid (no not the kind you take to get high!) and needed replaced.  Pick up at 3 so Beth got taken out to lunch as a thank you.  She can be a pain but when you are in trouble or in need of a Pounce or 10 she is there for ya!  Kudos to Beth the Brutal.  But don't get a big head, I will shoot you down first chance I get because that is just the kind of cat I am.<br />Mommy of course seems to be spending the whole weekend with Mike.  Yes, I like him but dammit I am the center of her world and he is intruding!  Never fear, mommy still forces ear drops in but not as often as she should.  I am still plagued with some ear problems once in a while.  I do fear I am getting older and mommy may need to start paying more attention to me!!! Oh well, I will just shed and make her bed all hairy and lay in the middle of it when she is trying to sleep and make her twist around me and feel achey in the morning.  There are always ways of getting even for slights.<br />Mommy's mommy had to take a trip to the Humane Society today.  Seems to keep dogs you need to buy them tags and she said $10 is enough no way would she wait and pay a late charge.  She still had a week.  Personally I think it would have been funny had she forgotten and if the dog catcher came this summer seen if she would have paid the huge fine ($60 I think per dog) or have let him take the poop eating creatures away.  Alas, I shall never know, she remembered.  She really pissed me off though, said she saw two really nice kitties and if I were gone she would have brought at least one of them home with her.  Like I could ever be replaced, that bitch!<br />January has seemed to go on forever!  I hate winter, cold, the windows are closed, just not a fun time of year.  I sleep lots and dream of spring and outside adventures.  Well, gonna nap now.  Will check in later.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Been a long long time since I brought my loyal readers stories from my point of view.  Please forgive me, I wasn't feeling well.  Mommy's mommy noticed it first since mommy is always so busy with Mike.  I just feel like I am not first in mommy's life, even though I was there for her all through those traumatic high school years, through the various dipshit boyfriends she dated and even there for the nice ones but now she has Mike and I might as well be shit some days.  But I get away from my original story, about how my mommy did not even realize something was wrong.  I stopped grooming myself and honestly started looking..well....ratty.  All I wanted to do was lay by the woodstove (which is another topic I must share sometime) and sleep.  Even POUNCE was not all that interesting to me.  Mommy's mommy say the butt-wipe dachshunds needed a trip to the vet because Max the Mangler needed his shots (hahahahaha) and Psycho Sam the Spastic had an ear infection.  She informed mommy that she thought I had an ear infection and a trip to the vet was in order for me as well.  Of course, even those nothing was wrong with Oscar (whose name lately seems to have been changed to You Dumbass) had to go along for the ride.  So mommy, her mommy and daddy, and the "boys" scheduled the event.  Mommy was at work the day it was to happen so her mommy agreed to take me.  Fat Chance!  She and mommy's daddy got the boys ready to go and then went to get me to cram my ass into the box.  Sure, I had been laying on the bed all day not moving but could they find me when it was time to leave, HELL NO.  Mommy's mommy was pissed big time and she called mommy at work and wanted to know if she knew where the damned cat would hide.  I guess I was the damned cat, fat bitch called me that, but I am the one that knew how to hide.  Mommy got off work early to come home and find me.  In the meantime mommy's mommy found me wedged into all the clutter under mommy's bed but she could not get me out.  I turned into DEMON CAT FROM HELL and spit and hissed.  That old, fat woman said some pretty foul things and left.  She had some words for mommy when she walked in the door, something about a sonofabitchin' under the bed that someone had to crawl under and get and she'd be damned if that goddam cat was going to bite her...gee, wonder who she was talking about.  Anyway, Mommy finally got me by moving the bed and trapping me.  Then she and her mommy got the fight of their lives trying to cram me in the box.  I hooked paws, tail, draped my stomach over the edge, anything to keep from getting stuffed in the box.  But two against one, so I finally lost.  The adventure began, Oscar roamed all over the back seat, Pyscho Sam cried and whined and stood on Max who turned and growled which upset their daddy stuck sitting with the 3 of them in the back seat.  The only decent one of the bunch was me, I just sat and shot daggers at mommy from the box.  Once at the vet the worst is over, no way Jose!  Mommy takes me in the box to go in and sign everyone in.  Mommy's mommy comes around and grabs Max and Oscar gets out because dad forgot to put his lead on.  Psycho Sam is freaking out and mommy's mom is holding Max, pinnning Sam to the seat and screaming at dad to have him get Oscar and just why in the hell didn't he have leads on the god-damned dogs since he knew we had to take them in.  As usual she was pissed.  Finally everyone made it to the waiting room where we waited forever.  All sorts of other animals were in there but I really could give a shit.  The boys were fairly good, Max shook, Sam was still freaky and Oscar walked around.  A miracle happened and the whole crew got called back.  Max got his shots, two of them.  I would have used a dull needle but no, the vet was nice.  She did not even stick a thermometer up his ass.  I would have used a big one and it would have been shoved in all the way!  Then it was my turn.  OMG!  That vet took these giant q-tips and I swear that she shoved them in one ear and out the other.  Yes, they were infected, mommy's mommy said the crap they dug out looked like someone had crunched up oreos in my ears.  Pretty gross.  Anyway, I growled and hissed and in general looked like Cat Possessed.  After mining the crap out of my ears they put these really bad ear drops in.  Needless to say these people must have taken lessons from the Marquis DeSade because the ear drops were sent home for future torture.  The only thing that makes me really happy is the same was done to Psycho Sam the freaky dog.  Oscar was outside with dad, just lovin' it tha everyone had to see the vet but him.  Just wait, his day will come.  Mommy did piss me off big time though and I almost forgot to mention it.  Seems she was asking her mommy how much it might cost.  Seems she had concerns about how much of her precious money should be spent on me.  Next time she has a bad day at work see if I curl up and purr and permit her to pet me, the heifer can sit and cry by herself.<br />The good news, the ears are better, I am one again well groomed (however it is winter mom, a good brushing would help even if I do gripe and complain), and POUNCES are still my favorite treat (although boiled chicken comes in a close second).  The boys recovered from this ordeal but I must take just a few more minutes to tell you about the latest tradegy to befall those imperfect creatures.<br />Mommy's mommy calls those stunted little mutants little fuzzy butts.  That was until this week.  It started with Psycho Sam.  He had an accident in his kennel (jail cell really since he pees on the carpet overnight if left unjailed) but it wasn't pee.  He had the hershey squirts!!!  Really gross ones.  Woohooo and it continued for two days.  Seems doggies can get the flu.  Sam was nice, I think I will call him Sharin' Sam for a change of pace, since he was kind and shared it with Oscar, the only mutant that can be trusted not being jailed.  Well seems Oscar got the shits while everyone was at work.  Crapped on the bedroom floor, crapped in front of the couch and by the woodstove.  Nice, runny, especially fragrant crapola.  Mommy's mom did not get mad since he was sick but refused to be the one to clean it.  She says she has to clean up enough shit cleaning the toilets, this was someone else's time to have fun cleaning up shit.  Daddy doesn't enjoy it but doesn't complain, he loves his boys.  Personally I am not sure it is a normal relationship but that is where I you can draw your own conclusions....him and those 3 dachshunds, just not normal.<br /><br />Anyway, enough for tonight.  I must bring you up to date on Christmas events and work events.  So much has been happening.  Woohooooo!!!  The Ratt is Back!<br /><br />Until this weekend, Ratty, Ruler of Her World.</div><br>
