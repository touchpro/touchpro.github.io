On December 27, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jacob about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I recently got a Ouija Board for Christmas. I was eager to use it, and I went to your website for help on making sure I have only good experiences with the board. My first night went like this.
<br><br>
<b>Night One</b>
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone here that would like to speak with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Ryan<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you, Ryan?<br>
Board: 65<br>
<br>
Me: May we ask any personal questions?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What year were you around? (possibly the day he died)<br>
Board: 1996<br>
<br>
Me: I was born in 1996, does that interest you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Ryan, how many spirits are here?<br>
Board: 2<br>
<br>
Me: Who is the other spirit?<br>
Board: Hailey<br>
<br>
Me: Was Hailey related to you?<br>
Board: Wife<br>
<br>
Me: How long were you married?<br>
Board: 3 Years<br>
<br>
Me: How many kids did you have?<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
Me: Why are you here?<br>
Board: I live here.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know anyone here?<br>
Board: Tony.<br>
<br>
Me: (Tony is my uncle) How do you know Tony?<br>
Board: Daughters friend<br>
<br>
Me: Do you enjoy talking?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: (Not sure how many letters of the alphabet we used) May you leave?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: I had fun talking, goodbye.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Having a great experience, I was so exited.<br>
<br>
<b>NIGHT TWO</b>
<br><br>
This is done with my friend Juan.<br>
<br>
Me: Is anyone here?<br>

<br>
Me: Did we talk to you yesterday?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are we bothering you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: How was your day?<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Me: What did you do yesterday after we talked?<br>
Board: TV<br>

Me: What did you watch?<br>
Board: Family Feud<br>
<br>
Me: Hahahaha, I think some of the people are stupid on the show, how about you?<br>
Board: haha same<br>
<br>
Brother: How did you die? (I got really nervous, I wasn't sure if he knew he was dead)<br>
Board: Hang<br>
<br>
Me: You hung yourself?<br>
Board: ije exicution<br>
<br>
Me: You were executed?<br>

<br>
Me: Who is talking now?<br>

<br>
Me: So you don't like Juan?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like me?<br>
Board: No, you suck.<br>
<br>
Me: What do I suck at?<br>
Board: Stupid, basketball on the tv.<br>

Board: Fuck off.<br>
<br>
Me: I'm sorry for angering you.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye<br>
<br>
<b>5 Minutes Later</b><br>
<br>
Me: Are you here with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you understand that I'm very sorry?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Well, I'm very sorry.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: May we talk to you later?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Talk to you later.<br>
Board: Suck It<br>
<br>
Me: What, no thanks.<br>
Board: Haha goodbye.<br>
<br>
I'm 13, I know to be careful, and I'm very happy comunicating with the spirits in my home. I wonder if I'm doing everything ok. So if you see some parts I may work on, please tell me.
