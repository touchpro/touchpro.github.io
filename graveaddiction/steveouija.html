On April 25, 2005 I received an interesting e-mail from Steve Gardner about his very scary ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;A friend and I planned to use a ouija board and neither of us had done one before.  I made a board from wood and waxed it really well.  I waxed the planchette too and it was perfect.  We're both kinda dumb so we planned to jump in the deep end and use the board in an old part of St.Marys church in Chesham, the town of which we both live.  We watched Van Helsen before we went to the graveyard, a film about werewolves and such things and drank a few beers.  We got to the graveyard with a few rollies (cigarettes), a videocamera and a few more beers.  We went to the oldest part of the graveyard at about 1.30am.  Chesham is a country town so it was bound to be dead quiet. 
<br><br>
We found a part that had a few really old graves dating from as far back as the 17 century and in the middle was a crypt and a little tree.  We managed to get on top of the crypt and made ourselves comfortable, opening a beer each and smoked a rollie.  I had the board on my lap and said &quot;ouija board&quot; three times and asked if there was anyone there.  There was no reply for a while and Lee was still filming.  He didn't touch the board much, he really just worked the camera.  I was sitting on the spine of the roof of the crypt, with my feet on the slanted part of the roof, so my upper legs slanted towards me.  The board was on my lap and with the planchette (pointer) on top, there was no way it could make it's way up the board.  (I only have to think about ghosts and I hear things and feel things by the way).  Anyway, Lee was filming and I asked the board if anyone was there and to show me a sign.  The only way we both can describe what we heard, was as if somebody was inside the crypt and fired a BB gun.  We both definately heard a loud ping, as if something rebounded off the inside of the roof.  The roof was made of heavy, thick stone and there is no way that two 10 stone guys on top had made a cracking sound.  It definately came from inside.  We both heard it, looked at each other and realized that the board was working.  I put my finger back on the planchette, for it to move up the board.  I had only briefly touched it and it moved on its own.  I pulled it down towards my crotch (the board sloped towards me remember) and it slid up the board another two times.  To be honest, I shit myself.  The board was so polished, what had happened was impossible. 
<br><br>
Lee was still filming the board and I said &quot;Fuck it, I was gonna ask you anyway.  Satan, are you there?&quot;  and as soon as I finished that sentence, the camera turned off, (our only source of light) and we both heard hooves about 100 yards to our right.  There were too many trees and bushes in the way to see but it was like as if a horse was walking on the spot, changing it's stance.  Our town is dead remember.  There was nobody around.
<br><br>
The camera refused to work and we had no light and couldn't see the board anymore, so we climbed back down the tree and I threw the planchette in some stinging nettles for if there was ever a next time.
<br><br>
We walked for a few minutes and started fighting with some sticks in the town park.  We saw a policeman walking up towards us.  I crapped myself because I had my imported rollies on me so I threw them on the floor and Lee asked what we should do?  I replied to carry on fighting so we did just that.  We watched in amazement as the officer started waving his arms and panicking.  He simply bolted towards the zebra crossing and disappeared.  We saw no police car drive off and he didn't run to the left or right.  He just... vanished!
<br><br>
We both thought it was weird and decided to go our separate ways and go home.  Nothing was abnormal on the way home, apart from my mind and I went to bed.
<br><br>
I woke up a few hours later (about 6am) with the feeling of being shaken from my right arm.  I opened my eyes and saw the most evil looking arm, clasped tightly round my right forearm, shaking me violently.  The thought makes me feel sick.  I couldn't believe my eyes and shook my head until I couldn't see it anymore.  My arm was red around my wrist and I still felt awake as I had before.  I shit my pants.  I felt like crap for that day and was a mess in the pub when talking to Lee and some other friends.  I have done ouija boards a few times after and I always ask for the Devil.  He always, always comes through to me.&quot;
