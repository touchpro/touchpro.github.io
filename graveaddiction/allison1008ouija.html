On October 17, 2008 I received an e-mail from Allison B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Her name was Melanie, and she died at age 18 in 1989 in Staten Island. She had been raped by a man by the name of Brian Jeabons. She tried to warn us about him, a man she said was a demon. She moved quickly through the board, wanting to tell her story. She warned us that Brian has been in our friends cat since 0ctober 2, 2008. After that, she told Allison to move to her right, because the demon was coming for us. We immediately ended the session and began prayers.
<br><br>
Another attempt to communicate with the spirits tonight put us in contact with a 15 year old girl named Scarlet, who lost her family and boyfriend in World War II. After losing her family and boyfriend, she killed herself by jumping off a building. Her boyfriend went to hell recently because he had killed a human with a stake. She was very upset to not see him again, and tried desperately to get out. She begged us for help multiple times, and when we asked how, she told us we had to die.
