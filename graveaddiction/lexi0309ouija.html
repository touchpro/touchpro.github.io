On March 26, 2009 I received an e-mail from Lexi about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I had a story that I thought was pretty interesting. I was using the ouija board with my friend, and we were talking to one spirit, but then, mid-session, I got this:
<br><br>
Me: Who is this?<br>
Board: (nothing)<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Ashley Hustler (we thought it was a joke, because the last name was 'Hustler', but I've heard weirder last names in this area)<br>
<br>
Friend: Are you a ghost?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Friend: How did you die?<br>
Board: Raped.<br>
<br>
Friend: You were raped?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Friend: Did you die because you were raped?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Friend: How did you die?<br>
Board: Suicide<br>
<br>
(don't ask why we continued to go along with this)<br>
<br>
Friend: How old were you?<br>
Board: 16<br>
<br>
Friend: What high school did you go to?<br>
Board: Smyrna (this crepped me out, because I went to this high school)<br>
<br>
Friend: Who raped you?<br>
Board: (two people I just happened to know)<br>
<br>
At this point I was freaked out, and I was finished for the night...I put it to goobye. But my friend said we should keep going along with it, and because we are such good friends and she still wanted to do it, I grew a pair and went back to the ouija board.
<br>
After starting all over:<br>
<br>
Friend: Where did they rape you?<br>
Board: At a party.<br>
<br>
Friend: Were you friends with (friend one)?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Me: Is somebody BSing us?<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Then after we had gone through this, the spirit changed to someone who called herself &quot;Queen Raven.&quot; She ruled over a kingdom which was in the now modern-day Gothenburg, Sweden. The funny thing about this was that two days earlier, in a dream I had, someone gave me a sheet of paper that said &quot;41113&quot; written on it, and told me not to forget that number. Turns out, after a lengthy Google search, I found out it was Gothenburg's postal code.
