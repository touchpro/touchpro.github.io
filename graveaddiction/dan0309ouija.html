On March 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Dan S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is a true spirit contact by using a board that I made.  I got in contact with a spirit whose name is Lucifer. I am not very sure if this Lucifer was telling the truth or not, but a lot of weird things have been happening around my house lately, ever since I talked with him. Here is my conversation. I needed to get it to you just in case what Lucifer said is true or not.
<br><br>
Dan: Are there any spirits who would like to talk with me tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: What is your name?<br>
Board: Lucifer<br>
<br>
Dan: Do you have anything to tell me, Lucifer?<br>
Board: Die<br>
<br>
Dan: Who's going to die?<br>
Board: You<br>
<br>
Dan: Why am I going to die?<br>
Board: Ciggerette's<br>
<br>
Dan: I am going to die because of my smoking?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: When am I going to die?<br>
Board: 31709<br>
<br>
Dan: What does that mean?<br>
Board: You are going to hell<br>
<br>
Dan: What?<br>
Board: You are going to burn<br>
Board: If you come with me I won't hurt you<br>
<br>
Dan: How do I come with you?<br>
Board: 31709<br>
<br>
Dan: Why do you want me?<br>
Board: [no movement]<br>
<br>
Dan: Why do you want me?<br>
Board: You are mine<br>
<br>
Dan: Why am I your's?<br>
Board: You have done wrong<br>
<br>
Dan: Do I know you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: How do I know you?<br>
Board: Bible<br>
<br>
Dan: You owned my bible?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Dan: Then what about my bible?<br>
Board: I am in it asshole<br>
<br>
Dan: You possessed it?<br>
Board: No idiot<br>
<br>
Dan: Then how do I know you from the bible?<br>
Board: Name in it<br>
<br>
Dan: Wow, are you famous?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: How?<br>
Board: Own hell dumbshit<br>
<br>
Dan: Wait, are you the devil?<br>
Board: Yes [lights flicker on and off, tv turns off and on, feel cold chill running through my body]<br>
<br>
Dan: Was that you who was doing all that?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: Why did you want to come and talk to me?<br>
Board: [No movement]<br>
<br>
Dan: Why do you want to talk to me?<br>
Board: Your mine<br>
<br>
Dan: But aren't you too busy?<br>
Board: No time<br>
<br>
Dan: You have no time to talk to me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Dan: There is no time down there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: What do you mean?<br>
Board: People<br>
<br>
Dan: What people?<br>
Board: Dead<br>
<br>
Dan: What about dead people?<br>
Board: There<br>
<br>
Dan: There are dead people in my house?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Dan: Where then?<br>
Board: 51<br>
<br>
Dan: What does 51 stand for?<br>
Board: Area<br>
<br>
Dan: There are dead people at area 51?<br>
Board: Yes asshole<br>
<br>
Dan: What happened to them?<br>
Board: Killed<br>
<br>
Dan: Killed by what?<br>
Board: Them<br>
<br>
Dan: Who are them?<br>
Board: Fuck off<br>
<br>
Dan: Are you telling me to fuck off?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Dan: Okay.<br>
Board: Die<br>
<br>
Dan: Don't go back to this again?<br>
Board: [No movement]<br>
<br>
[lights flicker on and off]<br>
<br>
Board: No more questions<br>
<br>
Dan: Why?<br>
Board: I kill you<br>
<br>
Dan: You are very rude, you know that?<br>
Board: I kill you 2<br>
<br>
Dan: You are also very weird at times.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
After that, all of a sudden my door opened but nobody was there. I went outside the room and heard screaming, and somebody yelling for help. I ran all around the house, but nobody was screaming or anything. When I came back downstairs, the Ouija board started ripping itself to pieces. Then all of the lights in my basement started flickering, and all the doors started closing and opening. I got into my bed, and it started moving up and down. I ran upstairs, but nobody was home. I ran over to my neighbor and told her what happened, but she couldn't hear me for some reason...she just kept staring at me. Finally I went to my church, and they told me that I should never play with one of those boards again.  They also asked who it was I talked to, and I told them the thing's name was Lucifer. They came to my house later the next day and did some kind of ritual in my room. But they told me it didn't work. It still happens every so often that I will see something, and then my basement will absolutely go crazy. I don't know what's going on, but all I know is I've got 7 more days left.
