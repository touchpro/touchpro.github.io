On January 14, 2010 I received an e-mail from C'dell Hunter about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is C'dell Hunter, and yes that is my real name...anyway, just today I decided to play the good old ouija board.  The online one.  So here's what happened.
<br><br>
The first conversation I had was with someone who wouldn't tell me who they were.  I asked if they knew me, and it went to yes.  Someone in my family? Yes. Then I asked if it was in the room with me.  I got a yes again.  Then I asked if it was my grandma. Then it said &quot;You're not ready.&quot;  About then, I said, wow wtf.  I asked if it was my grandpapa, and once again it told me that I was not ready.  Then I asked it what my name is.  It said Cdell.  Now, I don't know about the rest of you, but PC programs don't know your name, and with a name as weird as mine, I highly doubt that the program had my name in it.  I'd really like to know if anyone has had the same answer of &quot;You're not ready,&quot; and if so, what happened after!
<br><br>
Second Conversation: Is there anyone who would like to talk to me?  It said yes.  I asked if it was good or bad.  It said good.  I then asked if it was in the house with me.  It said no.  I asked if it was outside.  Again, it answered no.  I asked if it was safe in this room, and it said yes.  I asked if there was a bed, and it said no.  I then asked if there were any paintings or pictures in the room.  Again, no.  So I asked well, is there anything in the house?  It said yes.  I asked what things were in the house, and it couldn't say.  I asked if it was feeling weak, and it said yes.  I then asked if there was any way I could charge it up.  It said that it didn't know.  I asked if it was dark, and it said no.  I asked if it could hear anything, and it said no.  I then asked if it wanted to stop talking to me.  It said no.  I asked if there was any way I could help it out, and it said that it did not know.  I asked if it wanted to stay in this room, and there was no answer from the board.  So I asked if I was annoying it, and it said yes.  I asked if it wanted to go the, and it said yes.  So I said goodbye.
<br><br>
After that I felt so damn bad that I came into his house and talked with him.  I went outside and had a cigarette, then came back inside and tried again.  I asked if there was anyone that would like to talk with me.  It said that it was too dark.  I asked if this was the same person I was just talking with, and it said yes.   I said, &quot;Holy crap, I'm very sorry, go back to what you were doing.&quot;  HELLA FAST, it spelled out &quot;thank you.&quot;  I said goodbye, and it said &quot;c ya.&quot;  What I'm thinking is that this person got connected to or was waiting on something, or just didn't feel like going to heaven or hell.  If you have any ideas, hit me up with an e-mail.
<br><br>
I am now a firm believer in the ouija board.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for C'dell, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a>, and I will forward it on.
