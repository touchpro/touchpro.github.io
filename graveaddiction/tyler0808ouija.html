On August 5, 2008 I received an e-mail from Tyler K. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Me and a couple of my buds made an ouija board and had NO problem with it working because his house is loaded with spirits...five in every room we were in. It was good for a while, then things turned bad. Here's our story, and if anyone knows how to get rid of this please let me know!
<br><br>
We said a prayer and lit four white candles and burned some incense...we also layed down silver.
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits present in this room?<br>
Board: slowly goes to yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do you want to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Bruce<br>
<br>
Us: Are you from the sun or moon?<br>
Board: goes to sun<br>
<br>
Us: Do you mind us asking how you died?<br>
Board: Fire<br>
<br>
Us: You were burned in a fire?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Where was the fire?<br>
Board: Wisconsin<br>
<br>
Us: So you lived in Wisconsin?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Us: What year did you die?<br>
Board: 1856<br>
<br>
Us: Thank you for talking to us, Bruce. Is Nick's spirit guide here with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Hello, is this Nick's spirit guide?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: L.T.<br>
<br>
Us: Are you from the sun or moon?<br>
Board: goes to sun<br>
<br>
Us: Are those initials?<br>
Board: Ya<br>
<br>
Us: Thank you L.T. Is Dustin's spirit guide here with us too?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Hello, is this Dustin's spirit guide?<br>
Board: Yup<br>
<br>
Us: Are you from the sun or moon?<br>
Board: goes to moon<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: David<br>
<br>
Us: Where are you from, David?<br>
Board: South<br>
<br>
Us: Where in the south?<br>
Board: Somewhere ha<br>
<br>
Us: What year did you die, David?<br>
Board: 1903<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die, David?<br>
Board: Kittens<br>
<br>
Us(laughing): What color were they?<br>
Board: Purple<br>
<br>
Us: David, do you like to be funny?<br>
David: Indeed<br>
<br>
Us: Thank you, David. Is Tyler's spirit guide here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is this now Tyler's spirit guide?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Wang<br>
<br>
Us: Your name is Wang??<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Where are you from?<br>
Board: Korea<br>
<br>
Us: Will you tell us when you died?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Okay, we are sorry.<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die?<br>
Board: Grudge<br>
<br>
Us: You had a grudge with someone?<br>
Board: Wife<br>
<br>
Us: What happened with your wife?<br>
Board: Nothing<br>
<br>
Us: Do you like our board?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do you like the letters?<br>
Board: No, stupid<br>
<br>
Us: You think the letters are stupid?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is the person who made them stupid?<br>
Board: Gay<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anyone else who wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: Vance<br>
<br>
Us: Has Vance ever contacted Katie Conrad?<br>
Board: Bitch<br>
<br>
Us: Is this still Wang?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is my house number?<br>
Board: 173 (correct)<br>
<br>
Us: Good job, Wang.<br>
<br>
Us: Is there anyone else who wants to talk to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Is this the new spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you from the sun or moon?<br>
Board: moves quickly to moon<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Bad<br>
<br>
Us: We do not want to talk to you. Goodbye.<br>
Board: Never<br>
<br>
We then said goodbye and moved the planchette to goodbye. We also flipped the board and planchette.
<br><br>
About twenty minutes later we went into a different room and used the board again.
<br><br>
Us: Are there any spirits from the sun who wish to talk to us?<br>
Board: No, Goodbye<br>
<br>
We tried again in about ten minutes.<br>
<br>
Us: Do the animals in this room bother you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Are you from the sun or moon?<br>
Board: goes quickly to moon<br>
<br>
Us: We don't want to talk to you, goodbye.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name then?<br>
Board: Bad<br>
<br>
Us: Do you like Jesus and God?<br>
Board: No savior<br>
<br>
Us: You do not like God?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: What year did you die?<br>
Board: 0<br>
<br>
Us: Do you not want to tell us?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Okay, we respect that.<br>
Planchette begins to make a figure 8, we immediately say goodbye and flip the board and planchette and turn on the lights.<br>
<br>
Two of my friends go in to try to get this bad spirit to go away.<br>
<br>
Them: Is this the spirit we were just taking to?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Them: Are you mad?<br>
Board: Very<br>
<br>
Them: Please tell us your name.<br>
Board: Vance<br>
<br>
Them: Vance, you are from the moon?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Them: Vance, may we please speak to David?<br>
Board: For a bit<br>
<br>
Them: Is this David?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Them: How are you, David?<br>
Board: Splendid<br>
<br>
Them: That's good.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Them: So tell us about the kittens.<br>
Board: Claws<br>
<br>
Them: They clawed you?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Darin, being stupid: Do you fight demons?<br>
Board: Yes, Kill<br>
<br>
Darin: Oh, so you fight demons?<br>
Dustin: Wait, this isn't right...it's not supposed to spell kill. Is this still David?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Them : Goodbye (as they flipped it over)<br>
<br>
We then tried again and got Vance again first.<br>
<br>
Us: Is this Vance?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Why do you keep talking to us?<br>
Board: Fun<br>
<br>
Us: It's fun talking to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Why are you a bad spirit?<br>
Board: Sorrow<br>
<br>
Us: We're sorry...can we please talk to Darin's spirit guide?<br>
Board: Just a bit<br>
<br>
Us: Is this Darin's spirit guide?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: Baron<br>
<br>
Us: How did you die, Baron?<br>
Board: Water<br>
<br>
Us: You drowned?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Was it an accident?<br>
Board: Beer<br>
<br>
Us: You were drunk?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Do the other spirits in here like Vance?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
We decided to then just close the board for the night, and we all went to sleep.  I forgot to mention that Vance said the silver on the board bothered him. Nick, just to be safe, wore a silver necklace. He woke up and said he was sweating all night and felt things he's never felt before that was making his back arch and his body twitch.  We're thinking that it was Vance trying to take advantage of him, but the silver protected him. We're thinking that Vance has taken over the board...How can we get rid of him?

If you have any advice or comments for Tyler, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to him.
