On July 3, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kaitlyn about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Kaitlyn, and I'm 15 years old right now. I never really believed in the ouija board, but I had always been interested in trying it. Maybe to see if I could prove it wrong. Anyways, my friend brought her's over one day when she came to spend the night.
<br><br>
It was before dinner, and we had gone downstairs to my basement. It was dark, and we thought it would be the best place to use it. We talked to some guy named Fred and started asking questions. I thought my friend was pushing it, so I asked what year my grandfather died. It got it correct, but my friend didn't know the answer. Then my mom called my friend and I for dinner, but I ignored her because I was having fun. I asked the board, if I had a son what would I name it? And the board said go and eat and then it said bye...
<br><br>
I started believing a bit in it until one day my brother and I were playing it. We were sitting in my room, in the dark and silent. We asked if anyone was there and no one responded. So I remembered my friend telling me to push it in a figure eight movement because they hate that, so I did. All of a sudden, it got really cold in the room and I felt dizzy. I was just about to get up when I fell back from what felt like a push. It literally felt like someone had pushed me, but my brother had not and there was no one else in the room.
<br><br>
Thanks to those two experiences, I have to say that now I DO believe in the ouija board...
