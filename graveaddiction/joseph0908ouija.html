On September 25, 2008 I received an e-mail from Joseph Horan about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I had always had strange experiences in my parents house growing up, and also experienced weird things in my Godparent's house.  Their house had been a hotel in the early 1900's in Centralia, Pennsylvania. You would think that seeing and hearing things would make you able to use a Ouija board, right?  When I was about eleven, my Godparent's son, Chris, and I decided to try a Ouija board in their house to contact a ghost that seemed to walk the halls.
<br><br>
We tried the board in their front sitting room, and nothing happened. My first experience was a bust, but we didn't take it seriously so maybe that was a problem.
<br><br>
Fast forward to mid October 1995 when some friends and I had gone to Saint Steven's Cemetery in Shamokin, PA to walk around and see who had the guts to be in a reportedly haunted cemetery at night.
<br><br>
We pulled into the cemetery with two vehicles and parked in the center of the cemetery. Two girls, myself, and my friend Dan got out of one car and friends (twin brothers) Chris and Pat, along with their friend Dave, got out of the other vehicle.
<br><br>
All of us stood around and joked for a while.  Then Dan suggested that we get his Ouija board out and try it. Pat and I used the board first, and we had Pat's twin ask questions that his brother would be able to answer and make it look like we were in contact with something. We did this for a while, and the other guys in the group caught on and pretended to be amazed that the board was &quot;talking to us.&quot; The girls started getting scared, and that's when Pat asked, &quot;Who's there?&quot; and I pretended to be struck by something and fell over.
<br><br>
The girls screamed, and after sitting up and rolling my eyes back in my head to scare the girls more, we all had a good laugh.
<br><br>
Pat and I tried the board in a serious effort and nothing happened. Some others tried with the same result. Somebody suggested that the twin brothers try it, so they sat down, concentrated, and started a session.
<br><br>
Chris asked &quot;Is anyone there?&quot; Y-E-S was spelled out. All answers were spelled out, yes or no was never selected.
<br><br>
Can you answer our questions? - YES.
<br><br>
Someone asked who was the first girl I kissed? - JEN  - This answer was unknown to the rest of us, but we were told it was true.
<br><br>
I asked who was my first girlfriend? - BRANDY - This was the answer that I was thinking of, my 1st grade sweetheart. My friends knew that Kelly was my first real girlfriend, so I told them that the answer was actually true.
<br><br>
Each of us asked a personal question that the twins would not be able to answer. Answers such as the date that my grandmother died, etc were correct.
<br><br>
Pat asked &quot;Spirit, do you have a name?&quot; - YES
<br><br>
What is your name? - ********  The name made no sense, and one of the twins said, &quot;Something isn't right.&quot;  I won't type the answer out, and will tell why at the end.
<br><br>
Are you a good spirit or an evil spirit? - GOOD
<br><br>
Is there a Hell? - YES
<br><br>
Is there Satan? - YES
<br><br>
Is there God? - F*CK YOU - This was spelled out unbelievably fast and the twins went &quot;Ughhhh!!&quot; and let the plastic piece fly off of the board and stood up. They were visibly shaken and said, &quot;We're done, let's get out of here.&quot;
<br><br>
On the way to the cars we tried to figure out who we were talking to, but the name made no sense. Someone suggested that it might be backwards, so we spelled it out.  It was pronounceable, but not a name anyone recognized.
<br><br>
All of us left the cemetery, cruised the town of Shamokin for a while, then went home. My car was at the twin's house, so we hung out for a while and talked about what happened. Both Chris and Pat reassured me that they were not playing around when they did the Ouija board session. They also said that they had a feeling of dread when the spirit gave its name. They were pretty big guys, but were still a bit shaken and didn't feel well. We talked for a while and I went home.
<br><br>
A week went by and I stopped by the twin's house to visit Pat and cruise Shamokin again. We got to talking about the cemetery and the Ouija board. Pat said the spirit that we contacted was definitely not good, and the name had been given backwards. I don't remember who found the book with information in it, but someone had found a leather-bound book in the public library that listed Demons by name and told you how to call them and who they were. It explained that they were all different and occupied different areas of hell. I'm not sure that is exactly how the book presented the information, but that's how I remember it. The book was very old and weathered, and had a print date in the 1800's.
<br><br>
The name of the entity that we contacted was in the book. The name had been given to us backwards, and it was definitely an entity that should have been left alone.
<br><br>
I know that my friend Dan wrote a thesis paper on Witchcraft in PA when he was in college and he used that book as reference material.
<br><br>
After the cemetery incident none of us touched a Ouija board again, but the twins, Dan, and myself had some strange, frightening, and unexplainable things happen to us after this incident. Dan's dad became an ordained minister (I can't say that it was because of strange circumstances), and upon his father's passing his mother took over the ministry and continues to this day. The twins haven't had anything weird happen in a while. And as for myself, since then I have made it a point to have my newborn daughter baptized and believe that there is something out there that we should leave alone. If there is evil there is also good, and I will seek out the good. Take this for what it's worth.
