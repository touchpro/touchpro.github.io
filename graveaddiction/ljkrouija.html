On February 1, 2005 I received an e-mail from Jessica about the time a spirit they contacted stuck around after they were finished using the board! Here's the story:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I just moved a couple months ago to a street where my mom's best friend Karen lives with her two kids, Scooter and Chelsie alone. She has a ouija board and they hadn't used it for a while. I have used it once and a while with my friend Britney.
<br><br> 
One night, my next door neighbor Joey talked Karen into playing the Ouija board when my friend Angel was over. We went to her house and set it up with for different candles.
<br><br> 
Well, we have had some encounters with the Ouija boards for the past couple weeks and had some weird stuff happen. This time was not exception...We started talking to Angel's spirit guide, Matthew. It was doing fine when suddenly it stopped. 
<br><br> 
Angel: Matthew, are you still here?<br> 
Board: (doesn't move)<br> 
<br> 
Angel: Matthew are you still here?<br> 
Board: (very slowly) See me<br> 
<br> 
Angel: See you? Do you mean we're gonna see you?<br> 
Board: Yes<br> 
<br> 
Me: When?<br> 
Board: Tonight<br> 
<br> 
Me: Is this still Matthew?<br> 
Board: Jacob<br> 
<br> 
Angel: Jacob what?<br> 
Board: Koones<br> 
<br> 
Me: Who will see you?<br> 
Board: 2<br> 
<br> 
Scooter: Two of us will see you?<br> 
Board: Yes<br> 
<br> 
Me: Who?<br> 
Board: (silent)<br> 
<br> 
Angel: Who will see you tonight?<br> 
Board: (silent)<br> 
<br> 
 
We decided that the board wasn't going to tell us. We were wondering what to ask the board when Joey suddenly cries out, &quot;What's that?&quot; It was supposes to freak Angel out. It worked!  Ten seconds later, he goes, &quot;Whose shadow is that?&quot. On the wall, there was a shadow of a small boy sitting there. Every one was moving but it wasn't moving with us. 
<br><br>I DO believe in spirits!&quot;
