On July 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from April about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hi again, I remember writing a story in to you about an ouija experience I previously had that didn't really work too well. At the time, I believed in it, but now that I think about it, that ouija experience was pretty much fake.
<br><br>
---<br>
I played the ouija again a few months afterwards, at my friend's house. Her house is unbelivably old, and her room is suspected to be a built-in, as a window separates her room and her brother's.
<br><br>
She admitted to me that she had seen &quot;spirits&quot; in her house twice, along with being sweaty and scared. I believe her. She also said her mother has witnessed spirits too, saying that they're &quot;like a cloud - see through.&quot; I didn't know about her experiences until after we had played the ouija.<br>
<br>
We started out with looking up all the instructions on how to do it. We lit 11 candles, as the website had instructed us to. It told us to not ask for any physical proof that the spirit was there. We all agreed not to, though.<br>
<br>
We made our own board using the same method that my friend had used to make the one I played as my first experience. I used a plastic bronzer lid as the plachette, and just a normal piece of art book paper.<br>
<br>
Although we we wrote it down, I only remember an epitome of the session.<br>
<br>
The people who were playing were myself (April), Sabrina, and Lauren. Lauren was the host of the sleepover, and we were doing it in her room.<br>
<br>
We started off with just Sabrina and I, as Lauren didn't want to play it. We sat there for what seemed like half an hour with the planchette doing absolutly nothing. We got sick of it and begged Lauren to come join us. After much pestering, she gave up and came down. We sat there in a circle waiting for it to move for a few minutes, and kept on asking the same question: &quot;is anybody there?&quot;
<br><br>
Finally we got a response: the plastic lid moved slowly to &quot;yes.&quot; We looked at each other, doubtingly, and continued to ask.
<br><br>
Me (for some reason I was automatically made the medium of the session): What is your name?<br>
Spirit: Why?<br>
<br>
Me (I wanted to impress the spirit): Humans are curious creatures.<br>
Spirit: Why do you care<br>
<br>
Sabrina (cutting in): When did you die?<br>
Spirit: 1975 (roughly, I hardly remember.)<br>
<br>
Me: Were you murdered?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die naturally?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Spirit: I murdered me<br>
<br>
This was, of course, the final straw. None of us could move away from the board, and we all knew nobody was faking it.
<br><br>
Me: Are you female?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where did you die?<br>
Spirit: No response.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die at Wentworth Falls? (this is where we were playing)<br>
Spirit: I think<br>
<br>
Me: Who was your killer?<br>
Spirit: I don't know<br>
<br>
Me: Can you remember anything?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Was it the last thing you remember?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
I asked the question everybody wanted to hear the answer to.<br>
<br>
Me: Does God exist?<br>
Spirit: You will die (we began panicking) and you will find out (we were relieved).<br>
<br>
Pehaps there were other questions, I forget, but I remember hearing somebody come up the hallway.  We qucikly ended the session and hid the board.<br>
<br>
After we had eaten dinner, we came back, not knowing what to expect.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you still there?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
(unknowingly, the last spirit had long gone and we were talking to somebody completely different.)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you attatched to this house?<br>
Spirit: sort of<br>
<br>
Me: Are you here for anyone?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you here for?<br>
<br>
This was when things began to get a little weird. The spirit spelled out &quot;someone missing, 7-3.&quot; We sat there, a bit confused, until Lauren burst into tears. We asked her and she said, &quot;someone missing is my father, and that's my birthday.&quot;
<br>
We pulled our hands off the plachette and talked about it for a while. Again, we put our fingers on the board, after asking Lauren if she still wanted to do it. She agreed to.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you Lauren's father?<br>
Spirit: no response<br>
<br>
Me: Were you ever a human?<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
This gave us other ideas.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you watching over Lauren?<br>
Spirit: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a ghost?<br>
<br>
Lauren said, &quot;no, no, don't ask it that, it's too scary!&quot;<br>
<br>
Spirit: No<br>
<br>
Me: What are you then?<br>
Spirit: Angel<br>
<br>
Of course, we didn't know what it was saying. We thought it was going to say &quot;an ghost&quot;, but for some reason we were stuck on &quot;an gel&quot; for like, ten minutes. Suddenly we realized what it was.<br>
<br>
Sabrina: You're an angel?!<br>
Angel: Yes<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Are you Lauren's guardian angel?<br>
Angel: Kind of<br>
<br>
Of course, before this, another spirit was talking to us, telling us how it loved friendship and was our friend. We were happy and enjoyed it's presence.<br>
<br>
Me: Were you the same spirit we were talking to before?<br>
Angel: No<br>
<br>
Me: Aait...you mean we were talking to more than one spirit?!<br>
Angel: Yes<br>
<br>
I wanted answers.<br>
<br>
Me: Can you appear to Lauren?<br>
Sabrina got frightened at this concept.<br>
<br>
Angel: In some ways, and I'm not scary<br>
<br>
We laughed at that.<br>
<br>
Me: Do Angels know about other angels?<br>
Angel: (this confused us) some are popular<br>
<br>
Me: You mean, you have angel communities?<br>
Angel: Ha<br>
<br>
We looked at each other.<br>
<br>
Me; Are you...laughing at us?<br>
Angel: Yes<br>
<br>
We all had to laugh a bit. We liked this guy.<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a male?<br>
Angel: No<br>
<br>
Me: Female?<br>
Angel: No<br>
Angel: Like you see God as a male<br>
<br>
We all agreed that everyone thought God to be male. Me, being the femenist, was a bit miffed by this, but I ignored it.<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Do you protect Lauren?<br>
Angel: Yes<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Do you see through her eyes?<br>
Angel: When I need to<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Can we talk to our guardians?<br>
Angel: Do you need one?<br>
<br>
Me: Are you offering them to us?<br>
Angel: No<br>
<br>
Sabrina: Can we talk to our guardians please?<br>
Angel: You can't<br>
<br>
We sighed in dissapointment, but continued to speak to the Angel until 12 at night.<br>
<br>
Me: (bored) Do you know her name? (gesturing towards Sabrina)<br>
Angel: I know Sabriner<br>
<br>
Me: You spelled it wrong.<br>
Angel: No response<br>
<br>
Me: How many candles in the room are lit?<br>
Angel: (it was usually fast to respond, although it was taking a while to, what we presumed was counting.) 11<br>
<br>
On one occasion, I asked one of the spirits we had talked to if it knew one of my friends. It responded as, &quot;No sorry.&quot;
<br><br>
My friend Sabrina had drawn the board. While talking to Angel, it tended to confuse &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; because Sabrina had drawn them awkwardly. We said on various occasions, &quot;Aww, cute!&quot; It replied, &quot;I'm cute?&quot; We said, '&quot;yes,&quot; and it replied &quot;you're cute.&quot;
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I couldn't keep my big mouth shut and asked a stupid question.
<br><br>
Me: Can you tell us about our future?<br>
Angel: You know too much. Goodbye<br>
<br>
And so, our sesion had ended, period. We decided to go to sleep, and we were so scared we slept in the same bed. We tried again in the morning, but no success.
<br><br>
Thank you for reading my story, and I hope you put it on the site!
