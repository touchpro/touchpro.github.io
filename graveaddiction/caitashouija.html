On October 4, 2005 I received an e-mail from Caitlin and Ashley about their interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Our names are Caitlin and Ashley. I had just bought an ouija board because I had seen your site, and my friend and I were intereted.  So I had owned the board for a couple of days when I brought it over her house to play with it.
<br><br>
No one was home at her house but me and her (may I mention that we are only 13), and we played with the board but there was no movement. So we decided to put it up and go upstairs because we had played it in her basement. We were on the phone and we went downstairs because there is only one phone upstairs. I got on the phone downstairs. Her dog was down there with us and I had heard a noise.  But we always hear noises there, so I didn't mention it to her. Well, her dog had heard it too. A few minutes after that, we both heard a baby crying. We looked over towards where the sound came from at the same time.  We were really freaked out!  I had my cell phone, and I'm not sure why I had it because I usually don't get service down there anyways. I called her dad and he had asked if we had been playing with my ouija board and we said no. He told us he was still on the freeway, so he would be home in about 20 minutes.  I then called my sister who only lives about 5 minutes away.  She asked if we had been playing with it too. We had left the back door unlocked so we weren't sure what had happened, but whatever it was...it was in her house and it was a baby crying!  My mom put my board up and I can't play it for awhile!&quot;
