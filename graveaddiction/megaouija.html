On February 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Megan about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;One of my best friends has an Ouija board, and we use it a lot. The first couple of times we used it, we never ended the session properly, and her house and room is now officially haunted. We did research on the internet (we are really serouis about this), found out what we are supposed to do, and we have been doing it. Anyway, on to the stories.
<br><br>
My friend Nyoka and I love the Ouija board. We never ask the spirits their names, in fear that they would get mad at us. Once we got the courage to ask the spirit it's name. His name was Al, and we asked if we knew him somehow. He said yes, and we were confused since he said he had a message for Nyoka and she didn't know an Al. He said he knew her by her mom. It was something about her aunt, or somebody close to her. We contacted her grandpa and asked him questions, just to make sure it was him. We asked him what his aunt called him when he was little, and it was right! We asked if he had any messages for anybody, and it turned out it was a dog, Cricket, which was his dog before he passed away. We asked some more questions, and told him we would try again later. Then we contacted my grandpa, and I asked him some questions to make sure that it was really him. Questions that only he would know since I never talk about him, because I was young when he died. We talked to him a little bit. Nothing out of the ordinary since we were talking to our grandpas, and I don't think they wanted to hurt us. Another time we were using the Ouija board and her closet started opening and closing, so, naturally, we ran out screaming.  We did the same thing when her computer was making funny sounds after we had used the Ouija board, and it was doing funny things. That time, our friend Michelle was with us.
<br><br>
Funny things had happened to me before I knew about the Ouija board. Once, at my garage sale, I was sitting in the garage, and out of the corner of my eye I saw something that was huge and furry, like a cat's tail. Another time one of the lights went out in my room, and all the light bulbs were fairly new. I waited for a few seconds, then ran out of the room. When I stepped under the light (it was a ceiling fan) it came back on. Other things have happened, so I think I may have a sixth sense or something. I have visions sometimes, and they come true.&quot;
