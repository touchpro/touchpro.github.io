On October 11, 2008 I received an e-mail from Ankiara Franco about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

One day in class we were all talking about creepy, supernatural things that have happened.  My teacher told us this story about her friend's brother.
<br><br>
The brother had just bought this old house, and he was in the attic doing some repairs where he found this realllly old ouija board - it wasn't like the ones you buy at the store, it was hand carved. The guy is absolutely fascinated with this thing, and he's showing it off to everybody. Well, he started acting all weird. He started carrying the board with him everywhere - work, shopping, you name it. And he'd freak out if anyone tried to touch it. His family and friends tried getting it away from him, but he'd completely freak out on them. So the family did some research, and they found out about this psychic or something that lived pretty close by. They went to the lady and talked to her, and she said that it sounded like he was possessed.  She told them that she would have to go to their house to get rid of it, and anybody else who had touched it had to be there. So my teacher's friend had touched it, and was really scared for her brother and didn't want to go to this thing by herself.  So she asked my teacher to go with her.
<br><br>
My teacher said it was one of the scariest things she has ever witnessed. She said it took them forever to get the board away from the guy, and to get rid of it, the woman had to burn it. So, when the lady's making the fire, the guy is going nuts, he's screaming, and it took a couple guys who were there to hold him down.  Eventually the guy just started pacing, mumbling to himself. When the lady started burning the board, the guy starts screaming again and crying. He didn't calm down until the board was ashes. The lady then had to put the ashes in a bag and throw them into a nearby river so that the pieces would never be together. My teacher says that when all this was done, the guy was completely normal again. He didn't remember anything! When they told him what happened, he was completely shocked. My teacher won't go near ouija boards anymore.
