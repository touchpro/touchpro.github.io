On April 18, 2009 I received an e-mail from Natasha M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Okay, so my friends and I (there were four of us) were having a sleepover and decided to play with the Ouija board. Jodan, who had done it before, said no because she truly thought that it was a horrible idea, so only my two friends and I played. First we talked to a nice girl from the sun whose name was Liany.  She didn't really talk much, and we were getting bored with her, so we ended the session. After that we contacted another spirit, this one...was different.
<br><br>
Me: Hello, are you from the sun or the moon?<br>
Board: (goes to moon)<br>
<br>
{we get a little freaked out, but decided to just see how things get}<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a boy, or a girl?<br>
Board: B<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a boy?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Dick<br>
<br>
{at this point, my friends and I burst out laughing... like come on, all the lights are off, and we have an evil spirit named Dick. So obviously they started making fun of it and joking around. But I was getting pretty scared, and I started to feel a bit nauseous.}<br>
<br>
Me: Are you an evil spirit?<br>
Dick: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are we annoying you by making fun of your name?<br>
Dick: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want us to leave?<br>
Dick: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do we entertain you?<br>
Dick: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you intend to do us any harm?<br>
Dick: yes<br>
<br>
{at this point we all go silent, and my friend Jordan is partially yelling at us, asking why we asked that question}<br>
<br>
Me: What do you intend to do with us? (Stupid question...but to tell you the truth, it felt like I had to ask it)<br>
Dick: Kill<br>
<br>
We immediately closed the session, and I was super creeped out.  My friends didn't really believe in the board. We went to bed like 15 minutes later, and the second I closed my eyes, I saw people tied up, crouching, with their throats slit. I was so creeped out!!
USE THE BOARD WITH CAUTION!
