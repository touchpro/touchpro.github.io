On February 28, 2007 I received an e-mail from Justin about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My friends and I bought an Ouija Board over the weekend because we heard so much about them and decided to give it a try. I'm Justin and I was doing the board with my Brother (Brandon), and my friend Steve was scribe. We let Steve be scribe because he didn't really believe anything about Ouija Boards at first.
<br><br>
<b>Conversation 1</b>
<br><br>
Justin: Are there any spirits present?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know what year this house was built?<br>
Board: 1645<br>
<br>
Justin: It was built in 1645?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Was it the original part of the house that was built in 1645?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Can you tell us your last name?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Can you spell it for us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: Bradley<br>
<br>
Justin: Did you live in this house?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Can you tell us what year you lived here?<br>
Board: 1757<br>
<br>
Justin: Is there anything important you want to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: Park is Maze (the park is across the street from my house)<br>
<br>
Justin: Why is the park a maze?<br>
Board: Creation<br>
<br>
Justin: Creation?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: What is the park creating?<br>
Board: Bad person<br>
<br>
Justin: Is the park creating a bad person?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Can you tell us this person's name?<br>
Board: Drake<br>
<br>
Justin: Is Drake at the park now?<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
Us: Goodbye<br>
<br>
That was the end of our first conversation then we came in contact with another spirit, we wanted to find out more about this Drake guy.<br>
<br>
Justin: Is there a spirit present?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Are you a good spirit?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know about Drake at the park?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: What is Drake doing?<br>
Board: mfrieftphd<br>
<br>
Justin: Are you having trouble spelling?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Is Drake alive like us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know how old Drake is?<br>
Board: 23<br>
<br>
Justin: Is he at the park now?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: What is Drake doing now?<br>
Board: Mischief<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know Drake's last name?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know where Drake lives?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Justin: Will what Drake's doing affect us?<br>
Board: Frankly<br>
<br>
Justin: Is what Drake doing really bad?<br>
Board: no answer<br>
<br>
Justin: Will Drake get in trouble for what he's doing?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Justin: Are you saying he wont get caught?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Justin: Is he using anything to do this mischief?<br>
Board: Mind<br>
<br>
Justin: Does Drake have special power?<br>
Board: Very<br>
<br>
Justin: Were you going to say something after very?<br>
Board: Very weird<br>
<br>
Justin: His power is very weird?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: What does Drake do with his power?<br>
Board: Harms<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know how Drake can be stopped?<br>
Board: Tree<br>
<br>
Justin: Drake can be stopped with a tree?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Justin: Is Drake human?<br>
Board: Half<br>
<br>
Justin: What is his other half?<br>
Board: I don't know<br>
<br>
Justin: Do you know if he will do anything to us?<br>
Board: Save from trouble<br>
<br>
Justin: Is he going to save us from trouble?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Justin: Then why did you say that?<br>
Board: He will change you<br>
<br>
Justin: How will he change us?<br>
Board: Take all trouble away<br>
<br>
Justin: How will he do that?<br>
Board: Perfection<br>
<br>
Justin: Are we perfection to Drake?<br>
Board: No<br>
Board: He wants perfection<br>
<br>
Justin: What should we do<br>
Board: Stop<br>
<br>
Justin: Stop what?<br>
Board: Stop being the same<br>
<br>
The conversation went on and the board was explaining to us that this Drake guy loves perfection and he can affect the world.  The board was also explaining how Drake's love for perfection is not good because there will be no diversity, the board said people will be perfect but not happy, and he said people will have fake lives.  He gave us his first name but he didn't give us his last because he said if he gave us his last he wouldn't be able to speak to us again which he wants to.  We will know its him because he will say something to greet us next time.  We haven't done the board since but are hoping to this weekend.
