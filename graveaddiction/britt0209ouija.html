On February 14, 2009 I received an e-mail from Britt, Ash, and Mike about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Tonight was the first time the three of us had used a ouija board. We looked on your page and followed all the advice we could: we lit white candles, burnt sage, and had incense burning the entire time. During our first seance, we talked with a 17 year old girl named Lex, who was extremely friendly and was talking with us for awhile. However, when we asked her a question, she got interference from another spirit who was trying to talk to us. This spirit's name was Xavier. He was extremely powerful, but we could sense that he was not evil, but in fact very good. He kept spelling something out that seemed to make absolutely no sense to us whatsoever. We asked if it was a place, and several other things, he replied no to each. Finally we asked if it was a name, and sure enough it was. We asked many other questions following that, the last question we asked was whether or not he was warning us about this person. And he replied yes. Then we asked if we could close the board and he said yes, and the plachette went to goodbye. Previously he would not let us go. He found it imperative to warn us about this person. We had audio recorded the session. After this we took a break.
<br><br>
A short while later, we re-lit the candles and incense, and started another seance. We got in contact with a 10 year old girl who had died in 2001. She had some trouble with spelling, and as a result, we never found out where exactly she lived. However she did say no one went to jail for her murder, and that her mother was the one who had killed her. She didn't seem to have a problem spelling &quot;murder.&quot; She then informed us that her father had found out, spelling &quot;daddy.&quot; However, nothing had happened as a result. She was very friendly, and a bit playful, as she moved the plachette to several letters.  We asked if she was spelling anything. She said no, and we asked if she was playing, to which she said yes.
<br><br>
During our first and second seances, several spirits asked about my friend's baby (she's pregnant). The first one was Lex - she asked about the baby. When we asked if she wanted to know when it was due, the planchette spelled out &quot;May.&quot; Which is, in fact, my friend Ash's due date...well, month. Then the ten year old asked us about the baby, and she said &quot;May 17.&quot; But then we thought further and wondered if perhaps she was referring to what her age would have been had she not been murdered. Although she did clearly state that the baby was due in May. She said goodbye to us, and we closed the board and took another break to hydrate ourselves and recover from the shock of meeting a poor little girl whom was killed by her mother.
<br><br>
Again we started another seance, it was around 1 AM. We got what seemed like a friendly spirit, but didn't speak English. We closed the board and started again. We got a spirit, who again said that he didn't speak English. We asked the spirit what year it was, to which it replied 2009. After that, we asked if that was the year it died in.  It said &quot;No.&quot; Feeling a bit odd about this, the planchette moved again and was going to say &quot;born,&quot; but when Ash said a letter, it went to &quot;no,&quot; and then started spinning in circles. Then it spelled out &quot;born&quot; and then spun in circles again. We remebered that circles could indicate a demon, so we asked to close the board, to which it replied, &quot;no.&quot; Then the planchette started to spell out &quot;demon.&quot; It stopped right before reaching the &quot;n.&quot; But I had said to my friend to call out to the Arch Angel Gabriel to cast out the demon and all other negative energies and to protect us, and she did. Then we moved the planchette to &quot;goodbye,&quot; flipped over the board and planchette, and blew out the candles and turned the lights back on. We didn't get the demon's name. But we think it was Zadn, the one Xavier had warned us about. I recited the Lord's Prayer, or most of it from memory, and we burned sage around the board.
<br><br>
Our advice to you: IF A SPIRIT GIVES A WARNING, TAKE HEED!! Do not work into the late hours of the night. After awhile, negative energies come your way. This was also the only session not audio recorded, so  we cannot submit it as evidence, but you can be sure we will always record from now on! Thank you for your time, hope you enjoyed our story and our warning!
