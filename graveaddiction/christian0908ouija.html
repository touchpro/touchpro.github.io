On September 3, 2008 I received an e-mail from Christian B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I just got my ouija board last month, and it is already starting to scare me.
<br><br>
When I finally managed to summon a ghost, he said his name was Stu.  I asked him if he was a good spirit.  Nope.  But I didn't care.  I was just happy to talk to him, to finally have a spirit to converse with.  Apparently, he lived in the 1400's, died at 25 during a fight (he lost), and had 4 children.  I asked to speak to one, but I was denied access.  So much for that.  It was hard to get rid of him, but I promised to talk to him later.
<br><br>
I did talk with him later, but I avoided all questions that I figured would make him mad.  I later stopped talking to him completely.  Every time I got him on the board, I'd kindly ask him to leave.  After a few times, he must have deemed this rude, because he wouldn't let anyone else talk to me.  So I started talking to him again.  Stupidly, I asked if I could take a picture of him.  He agreed, but nothing I could detect showed up in the picture.  However, a few days later I began seeing figures late at night.  I thought maybe I was just tired, but Stu insisted it was him.  I stopped using my board, but he kept showing up.
<br><br>
I recently used it again, but instead of the planchette moving, I heard a grown man's voice.  I was the only one in the house, all TVs off.  Like a moron, I was too scared to understand what he said.  A day after, I was typing some stuff up on my computer, midafternoon.  I looked at my hand and saw a red dot from something like a laser pointer.  I freaked out, thinking I was going to get shot.  I have not spoken to Stu since, because I have a hunch he did it.  Hey, he had every reason to.
<br><br>
I owe him a an apology, I guess. Hehehe...Sorry, Stu!
