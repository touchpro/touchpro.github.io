On November 28, 2009 I received an e-mail from Riley about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It started when my two cousins, Laura* and Anna*, came to visit from Ohio*. I had just started messing around with Ouija boards at my friend's houses, and I decided to Google if and how you could make your own board. I was eleven years old at the time.  It turned out that you could, and we made one out of paper and a glass turned upside down.  We started using it in my room, and it worked a little bit.  We met a spirit named Zoe, but we didn't really come across anything too weird or scary.  Then, I learned that me, Anna*, Laura* and my other cousin, Izzy* were going to spend the next night at our grandmother's house, which we believed to be haunted.  So, we went to the local Target and purchased a real Ouija board.
<br><br>
When we got to Grandmother's house, we started using the Ouija board right away. We spent the rest of the day talking to spirits, nothing too important...until the next day.  The next day it started out the same.  At the time we were talking to &quot;Zoe,&quot; the spirit we met back at my house.  I asked a question related to, &quot;What am I thinking of?&quot; Zoe started to spell out what she thought I was thinking.  All of a sudden, the lights went out then came back on, but they were flickering.  The televison we were next to started changing channels. And the planchette was going in circles.  All of a sudden, the planchette spelled out, H-E-L-L, we then asked if we were still speaking with Zoe, and it went to NO.  We then asked who we were speaking with, and it then spelled out S-A-T-A-N.  We then said GOODBYE and flipped the planchette upside down.
<br><br>
A little while later we tried the board again.  We started out the same (&quot;Are there any spirits present?&quot; etc.) and we asked if this was Satan again.  It responded with a MAYBE.  We kept asking, and then all of a sudden the lights turned off again and the planchette went to YES. We said GOODBYE again and threw the board outside.  That was our scare with Satan.
<br><br>
(All of the names and/or places that end with a * have been changed for safety reasons.)
