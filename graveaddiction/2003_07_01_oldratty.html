		<div class="content">I'M BACK!<br /><br />Well, the ear torture has ended.  Monday night was the last night of abuse..well, ear abuse that is.  Hope these idiot people know not to EVER subject me to such indignities again.  But never fear, I pooped in a hidden location and mommy will not find it for months.  She best take care, I am not above pooping in her closet among the millions of clothing items she tosses there.  I know if I ever have the opportunity to maim and kill again (probably when the humans harvest this fall and the mice try to move in) that I will probably put my kill in mommy's closet.  Although, I don't know if that would be as much fun as placing it where mommy's daddy is sure to step on it in his bare feet.  That man can swear with the best of them......<br /><br />The air has been turning blue around the house this week.  Seems Mommy's mommy is not happy with "work" right now.  She has been rude and mean and yelling and swearing all week.  She throws out some names but I do not know these people so could care less.  Just know it is kinda fun, when she is on the warpath the rest of the humans and those sub-human mutants (the "boys", the dachsies) suffer and just try to stay away.  She was telling mommy about one of her situations and was yelling and swearing and throwing her arms around so I jumped on the bed, got right in her face and yowled too.  That made her laugh, guess she did not understand that she was getting on my nerves and I was calling her a few choice names.  Ever notice how lots of stuff goes on in Mommy's mommy's bedroom.  Seems to be quite the gathering place for crying, swearing, talking and bonding with the mutants.  Mommy's mommy says just about everything goes on there but her getting a good nights sleep.  Something about her age and something called hormones keeps her from sleeping and makes her hot all the time.  Another thing she is always bitching about.  She just needs to shut up and cook a meal, a good meal, with chicken, and give me some of the chicken.  I love chicken but that cow never shares, says I have cat food to eat.  Bullshit, that stuff tastes like old fish and besides those damned deformed dogs are always sticking their noses in for a mouthfull and drooling all over it.  Assholes!  All of them.<br />Mommy decided the weather was beautiful and I needed a trip outside.  She picks me up and then dumps me on the deck.  Not on a comfortable deck chair, on the hard floor with the peasant cats and the stunted clowns, like I am a common being.  Oh no way that was going to fly, I was over at the door, yowling like crazy wanting back in.  Next time she needs to think before depositing me on the floor.<br />Hmmm, we haven't hosted a party for a while.  I love parties, lots of people, lots of careless, food-dropping people, lots of people suckers for a gentle pat on the arm and big yellow pleading eyes.  I think someone needs to plan a party and soon.  I have heard a few discussions but nothing concrete.  Will keep you up to date on the upcoming events.  Need to go into my spycat mode.<br />Speaking of spycat, I just love popping open the bathroom door and startling people.  Better still, manage to get in while someone is in the shower and peek behind the curtain.  I can really scare mommy doing that!  I have got to say however, seeing people naked is enough to make me bring up a hairball.  I am surprised they ever breed, they are not pretty creatures.  The Creator made me in His image, not sure where he got the idea for humans.<br />Well, better go now.  Time for my next nap.  A quick turn around the house to aggravate the smelly hounds and then to a new place for a nap.  I figure I will take about 20 naps before the humans get home.  Talk later!  RattyCatt</div><br>

		<div class="content">The cruelity is unbelievable.  I was good cat all weekend.  I tormented the stunted dogs, I begged for POUNCE, I used the litter box not the floor, I was a model puss.  What I did to deserve the torture I received is beyond all understanding.  It started innocently, mommy picked me up and petted me, told me how pretty I was and carried me back to her mommy's bedroom.  Beth the Brutal was there with Psychotic Sam, they were bonding or some such thing.  Mommy put me on the bed with them, unusual since I hate being that close to a combo of Beth the Brutal and Psycho Sam, the fluffy dog.  Worse, mommy yelled at Beth to move her lard ass over and then mommy grabbed me and held me as if I were in a vice.  Mommy's mommy came in and stuck a tube in my ear!  My ear has a tube stuck in it and then she puts 3 drops of gunk in my ear.  It was horrific!  It ran down my throat and tasted terrible and tickled!  Not enough torture, they flopped me over even though I was hissing and spitting and trying to gouge their veins open, and stuck that dreaded tube in my other ear and repeated the process.  Needless to say I ran from the dungeon after flashing them "the pissed off pussy" glare.  I hid for a long time in the basement.  Not even POUNCE helped my feelings later.  I hated them all, especially that bitch that shoved that crap in my ear.  Enough torture, no way, the same thing happened Sunday night.  Perhaps I like ear mites, no one asked my opinion.  They are my ears, permission needs to be asked and given prior to shoving unwanted tubes in my ears.  Oh yes, revenge will be enacted at the time of my choice.  It will be painful and possibly smellie!!!<br /><br />On a high note one of the abnormal dogs had an adventure that I feel must be karma for the mean things he has done to me.  Max the Mangler was visiting the park next door.  Seems there was a drainage ditch.  The dumbass fell in, I mean how stupid can you be, duh, it is a ditch, jump over it!!!  Anyway, he fell in and Pyscho Sam was beside him self and paced but neither one barked for help.  The people finally noticed a nose and head bobbing above ground level and rescued the idiot.  I rolled over laughing when I heard that one...total Dumbass.<br /><br />Mommy and her boyfriend were dumb this weekend too.  Their hearts were in the right place but they heads weren't.  The brought me home cat treats...taste temptations or some such thing.  What ever made them think I would eat through a hard crunchy outside to get to something tasty and soft especially when the treats are so teeny tiny.  I let the dogs that would be cats eat the treats while I gave mommy and Mike distainful looks, the fools.  POUNCE, food of the gods, the only treat for me....except mousers (the treats not the real thing).  I used to love mousers, wonder whatever happened to mousers?  Think I will sit on the windowsill the rest of the day and ponder the mystery of the mousers...........<br /><br />Pray for me.  I can only hope the Marquis Mommy's Mommy will not torture me today the sadistic cow.  Until later, Ratty</div><br>

		<div class="content">I AM A BELIEVER!!!  ALIENS ARE HERE ON EARTH!!!  I HAVE WITNESSED ALIEN ABDUCTION!!!<br /><br />Well, it must be.  Those creatures are not of this earth.  They have ensnared the humans and made them their slaves.  They are dachshunds, with those black liquid eyes, stubby legs, long bodies and floppy ears....they must come from another galaxy.  All one of the strange beings has to do is roll over on its back and expose its soft, tender belly and the people in this house, mommy included say, how cute, he wants his belly rubbed.  Whatever!  I roll over, fold my beautifully marked little paws over my chest and look cute and all I get is Dammit, Ratty, get out of the way before you get stepped on.  I am the beautiful one, what do they find so appealing about those creatures from the depths of hell?  Those elongated rodents are so simpering, always trying to please and be cute, how can anyone love them.  I am a cat, sure of who she is, dominant and unwavering, independent and strong, ready to kick and scratch and growl with little or no provacation...why do these people like the poop-eating monsters so much.  The worse part of living with the three stooges is that they eat all my food.  Sure, when I raise a fuss I get more food in my bowl but geez, wash the bowl, I hate slobber, I mean those things drool and it gets in my bowl!  GROSS.  Oh better still, the water I have must be better because the asshole lickers drink that too.  I mean really, do you want to drink after something that licks itself the way they do.  Stop, I know I must clean myself but I am perfect and not dirty so that just isn't the same.  All of this would be tolerable but the distribution of treats is equally unfair.  They go outside, take a dump in the yard, come back in and because they are "good boys" get treats.  This happens several times a day.  I poop in a box, cover it to eliminate the smell, travel all the way into the dark basement to take care of this and do I get anything?  Hell no, I never here good girl or here Splotch, have a POUNCE, greatest taste in the whole world.  No I am ignored until I cry and scream and stomp all over the house.  All I want is that juicy, tender morsel of true bliss, chicken flavored bit of heaven.  By the way, if anyone reads this from the home front just know that more than one morsel is allowed....duh, I am queen size and need a little extra to keep my bountiful figure.<br /><br />You can probably tell that I am feeling ignored.  I think I will go from bed to bed, laying on pillows and shedding.  Nothing like cat hair up the nose at night to make them remember who rules!  Until another day, I remain, Ruler of All, the Mighty, the One, the RATTYCATT!</div><br>

		<div class="content">I HATE HER, SHE IS THOUGHTLESS AND CRUEL!!!!  That witch mommy forgot to feed ME!!  Her little baby, her Rattykins, her Rattus Cattus, the Supreme Ruler who permits mommy to sleep on her bed (dumbass says it is her bed but I, the Purring Princess knows the truth, the bed is MINE!) was starving.  I started early in the evening when mommy decided she was tired and needed a nap after working all day (ha, she has no idea what work is, try ruling over the three mutant dogs).  She was napping in the bed and I purred in her ear, laid on top of her, put my paws on her face and yowled (so unbecoming but what choice did I have) and still the lazy creature napped.  I changed tatics and went into the other bedroom and there was mommy's mommy changing clothes.  The phone rang so she answered and chatted with Beth the Brutal (that bitch even had the nerve to ask mommy's mommy if that was the Blobbus Americanus squawling in the background, I will get her).  She chatted quite a while even though I jumped on and off the bed, yowled, purred, and got right in her face.  Then mommy's mommy left and did laundry and started supper.  I followed on her heels since I knew there was no use attempting to wake sleeping beauty from her slumber back on the bed, the cow.  Mommy's mommy ignored me...ME, I could not believe it.  Finally supper was ready and everyone came to eat, even the stunted, elongated mutants got a bite from the table from Mommy's Daddy but I was once again ignored.  The hunger was driving me to madness so I stomped around the house, jumped from window to window, picked fights with the deformed denizons of darkness aka as the "boys" and all that happened was mommy's mom yelled at the "boys" to stop chasing the cat.  HELLO!!!  The CAT IS STARVING.  These people must all be blind, deaf and I know they are dumb as in STUPID!!!  This went on the whole evening, it was cruelity to the max.  Finally, at long last, as she was taking her vitamins mommy's mom asked me what was wrong, why I was being such a pest....me a pest, hell woman, I am starving don't you listen?!?!  Some divine hand must have reached down and turned her head because she looked and noticed, finally, after an eternity that my bowl was empty.  Can you believe she looked at me and said, Ratty, you have got to let me know when you are out of food....DUH!!!!  Next time I will take an ad in the paper, idiot.  To add insult to injury, as she was filling my bowl with food she had the nerve to say...Ratty right now you get only food, no POUNCE (nectar of the gods) because you are getting way to fat.  I almost had heart failure, I cannot believe that insenitive human said that to me, me, God's perfect creature, Ruler of All, Generous and Kind, I was devasted.  I looked in my bowl but my appetite was gone....REVENGE took away my hunger.  As she sleeps tonight I will shred something, a shoe, some paper or better still, since she values sleep above all I will find a plastic bag and rattle all night, dragging it up and down the hall.  Ahhhh yes, I am truly the greatest.   Until next time, the Ratty.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Been a busy cat lately.  Last week mommy did not totally clean my litterbox!  I mean does she really think I want to put my perfect little pussy feet in shit?  Get real, only perverts with strange fetishes would do something sick like that...yuck!  So I have spent much of my time pooping in the basement behind chairs and the exercise equipment that mommy never uses.  I am very good at hiding the criminal activity, but it always happens, mommy's mommy finds it.  She is such a nib-shit, always picking up and cleaning.  Thankfully only one member of the household has that fault, the rest are pretty much pigs and let her do all the picking up and cleaning....which aids me when hiding a crime.  But wait, who is the criminal, me or mommy.  I use my litter box when it is clean, mommy would have a fit if she had to crap in an unflushed toilet.  Anyway, mommy finally got around to cleaning my litter box and she was really quick about it.  See, when she has neglected her duties I have the perfect punishment.  I watch and wait until she gets the bag of crap out of my box and quickly before she can put a new bag in I run over and take a big old smellie dump in the box and if I am really good and have drank plenty of water I can add a few gallons of piss.  Mommy gets mad and screams and calls me nasty names, oh if she only knew the things I call her.  But woe is me, mommy was on guard last night and was able to get the bag over the litter box and full of nice clean litter before I could punish her.  Never fear, I can still fart in her face tonight in bed.  She will regret neglecting me.<br /><br />Mommy's mommy, has had it tough lately.  Lots of her aunts and uncles and her mommy (my mommy's mommy's mommy) all died the last couple of years.  That was really hard on everyone but then last December mommy's mommy made the decision to take "Cherokee" our big outside dog out to the vet one last time.  She cried lots and Cherokee never came home.  But that was then and I thought everything was fine until this past Friday.  Mommy's mommy cried again, this time over one of the inferior ones outside.  Mommy's mommy's mommy had Cuddles, a gray and white short hair kitty who was a little off in the head but a pretty nice old gal even though I always had to let her know who was boss when I visited outside.  Anyway, Cuddles came to live at our house when mommy's mommy's mommy got sick about 10 years ago.  Cuddles was middle-aged even then so you can only imagine how old Cuddles was now.  I think she roamed the earth with the dinosaurs.  Well, Friday Cuddles went to the vet one last time.  She has not come back and I do not think she will.  I worry, what if they take me to the vet one last time, I know that Mommy's mommy has threatened that when she catches me on the table or gouging her leather shoes.  I just know that one last trip to the vet is not a good thing.  But better than the fate of one of the other inferior ones.  Little black kitten did not come running for food Saturday morning.  Mommy and her friend Mike went walking the road Saturday night and found him.  Squashed like a bug, mommy cried and she and Mike buried him.  Wow, this is not a good thing.  The cat population is starting to thin.  I thought it was temporary because usually Newt, one of the other inferior ones has kittens but she took a trip to the vet and was "fixed".  Did not know she was broken, seems to me the vet did break something, because now Newt can no longer have kittens.  And humans call that fixed!  Right, they fixed me as a youngster, I have never had babies or even sex plus my front claws disappeared.  They worked, it all worked, before I got fixed.  Humans confuse me.  Think I need to relieve some stress, now where are those shoes...............<br />talk later, Rattykins.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Okay, get real, I have a life, I do not live to blog only.  A girl like me is always busy.  So much to tell.  I will start with Friday and my evening out.  Beth the Brutal stopped to visit (and get a free meal, like I don't know the truth!) and wanted to take pictures of the 3 devil dogs and the new barn that is currently under construction.  Mommy decided it was a nice night to stay home and sit on the deck and she invited me.  I was sitting on the swing under the tree looking down on the inferior ones, in general just enjoying my outing when Beth the Brutual and MM decided I needed to see the new barn.  Those two bitches kept at Mommy until she gave in and carried me up the hill (WHAT!?  You thought I would WALK!?).  Without any warning or ceremony whatsoever Mommy dumped me on the ground, the ground, complete with dirt and grass, and left me there.  Dirt, grass, the Terrible Threesome of Buttlicking Dogdom and the inferior ones!  The inferior ones thought I should climb, me climb!, the mountain of gravel.  Idiots!!!!  I gingerly walked over to the building, checked out the concrete floor and then bolted, running full speed, down the hill, past the trees, toward my house!  Mommy of course ran after me, wrongfully assuming I was headed for greener pastures, such as the herb garden, but no, I only wanted to be back in the house with air conditioning and POUNCE.  I survived this ordeal but it was stressful.  Mommy's mommy's shoes were abused in retaliation.<br />Saturday and Sunday were days of rest and pampering.  Mommy's friend Mike, visited and gave me a wonderful body massage and face scratch, the hounds of hell were put outside for a big part of both days in their kennel where they did holes, bark and get dirty and smellier (dreadful creatures), and in general the weekend was nice.  Then came Monday!<br />I rid the house of mice and keep the mice from even entering.  I sit and look pretty making our home a better place.  I permit people to touch me, when the mood is right.  I am the perfect creature, so why in the hell can one of the hounds get so much attention by not pooping.  Everyone was worried, Max the Mangler did not poop Monday morning.  So what!  The stupid thing probably ate a rock, he eats everything.  They all think my litter box is the candy store, filled with tootsie rolls and crunch bars...idiots, it is shit, my shit, my waste...but they all eat it.  They eat worms they dig up, Max especially will chew on sticks and rocks...really, the fool will chew on a rock...duh, dental bills!!!!  So everyone was shocked that Max could not poop?  I know they all went to work to make money to support me in the fashion I deserve, but while there they worried that perhaps Max needed to see the "VET", needle wielding torturer...hmmmmm, there is some merit in having Max visit her...but Praise the Powers that Be (ME) Max pooped.  In his kennel during the day but MAX POOPED.  There was much rejoicing.  UNBELIVABLE!!!  Surprised they did not mount it on the wall.  One happy note, the inferior one outside, the bearer of kittens, did go to the "VET" Monday.  She will no longer bear kittens when she comes home.  Mommy's mommy was mad, says these thoughtless people who dump cats (and dogs) don't realize that now she must take care of Newt (the inferior one's name, was new kitty when she arrived in our yard and has been shortened to Newt) and pay so Newt doesn't keep blessing us (she said that sarcastically) with kittens.  She gets really angry sometimes, says other people do not reallize that cats and dogs don't easily revert to catching their own food and that people that live in the country really do not want their cast off pets.  Mommy's mommy really gets angry and yells when this subject comes up so I yowl right along...I think she is right for a change.  Know this, Ratty Catt, Supreme Ruler says be responsible when you decide to get a pet.  For if you do not, when you least expect it, I will visit, gouge huge lines in your leather shoes or shred your canvas shoes and possibly poop on your bed.  REVENGE is FUN!!!<br />Well, everyone went to work today so I must nap in the sun shining through the windows, watch birds (which means I must run from window to window, taunt the dogs since they are kenneled, eat from their bowl and drink their water just because I can and get on the kitchen table (because that is FUN!)</div><br>

		<div class="content">Good Morning adoring fans!  Okay that is it for being positive today.  Geez, I mean where does mommy get some of her ideas.  Last night she went grocery shopping with her mommy.  They come home with treats for the butt licking freaks and mommy brings me two bags of cat litter...woohoo.  I shit in cat litter, I drag it all over the house, but I do not eat cat litter.  I eat cat food, begged treats from the table (so humilating to beg but a girl has to do what a girl has to do), and POUNCE.  Mommy kept saying, look baby cat litter...who cares.  Take it downstairs dumbass and clean out the crapper, make yourself useful and then give me POUNCE!!!  I love mommy but sometimes I wonder if she was dropped on her head as a baby.<br />The "boys" as their Daddy loves to call them, the braindead, eternally grateful for anything, elongated mutants, aka dachshunds, got treats!  Breathbusters (toilet bowl tablets with scrubbing bubbles is what they should eat for their breath!), snausages, pupperoni, dogwiches, and chicken legs, all for them, all because they bark like idiots whenever the outside cats look in the door, they bark like idiots when the doorbell rings, they bark like idiots when Beth the Brutal visits, they bark like idiots if someone leaves the room and comes back in, face it, they bark like idiots, roll over on their back exposing their privates so they can get a belly rub, they chew toys and play fetch and hide under the blanket, and they get treats.  They serve no useful purpose.  I have killed 3 times in my life, I alone have protected the house from the invasion of dreaded mice and they get the treats, I get cat litter.  Think I may have to use someone's shoe as a litter box as revenge.  Of course, my favorite revenge is to seek out mommy's mommy's shoes and scratch big gouges in the leather.  See, when mommy's mommy...or MM as I like to call her (among other names) gets pissed she yells at the whole family.  So one act of vandalism and I get revenge on all.  I AM THE RULER, ALL SHOULD BOW BEFORE ME!!!  Sorry, just felt a little God-like there for a moment.  <br />Rain, dammit, more rain, I am so sick and damned tired of rain.  I cannot go outside on the deck to bathe my beautiful coat in rays of sun, I cannot sit ina lounge chair looking down on the "outside" cats, the inferior ones, I cannot swat at the fat, treat-filled beasts as they run around chasing the inferior ones, and most of all I miss the opportunity to take off and hide in the wonderful herb garden when mommy is distracted.  I love munching on the various herbs but mostly I love blending in and then watching mommy panic because she cannot find me.  She is not really that smart, I always hide in the same general area, but before all is said and done she practically has called in search and rescue teams to find me.  Of course, I am the best part of her life so I guess her panic is understandable.  This monsoon must pass soon or I will have to find more shoes to destroy.<br />Poor Beth the Brutal or perhaps it is Beth the Batty....things are not going well for her at work.  She called to talk to her mommy and I heard terrible words coming from the phone.  I must make a note, should she visit and want to hold me to relieve stress that I must growl and be all pissy towards her until she gives me POUNCE, then I will permit her a moment of purrs and she will feel better.  Sometimes I feel bad, not for long, but sometimes I do.  I am mean to Beth the Batty but she is the best face scratcher around, although mommy's boyfriend is a close second, his only problem is he likes to lay on the floor and play with the tail-wagging idiots.<br />Well time for me to go.  All the people have left for the day.  Max and Sam are not trusted and must be kenneled when unattended.  Play time for me, I can sit on top of the kennels and look out the window, I can walk by their kennels, tormenting them because I am out of reach and best of all, I can sit by the french doors, look outside, play through the glass with the outside cats and the barking fools cannot get to me......tormenting them gives me much pleasure.  later, ratty</div><br>

		<div class="content">Oh now I have heard it all!!!  Beth the Tormenter has totally lost her mind.  See, she has lots of responsibility on her job (or at least that is what she wants me to believe, I think she just wants an excuse not to visit and give me my damned Pounce treats, she is such a pain in the ass) and has to review something called statements.  I mean how can this statement thing be more important than visiting and giving me the taste treat I crave, Pounce!  She was on call for 3 days and nights or something like that and then had to go in to work the night of the 4th and QC (whatever that is!) and she has not been right since.  Beth the Tormenter called and talked to mommy's mommy (I know that makes her my grandmother but she is so rude about that, says she is not a grandmother to a G-- D------ Cat! so I cannot call her Grandma.....I know what I would like to call her!) and was complaining about her sleep pattern being messed up and now she thinks she is nocturnal and she must be a bat!  Beth the Tormenter needs a name change...Beth the Insane Tormenter!  She is such a waste, makes me want to jump on her face and try to suffocate her like I did when she lived here.  Oh now that is such a special memory...when I was a teenager I was quite bold and loved laying and sleeping on the Tormenter's warm water bed.  She had this strange idea that the bed was hers, I had no business sleeping in the middle of it and she would even throw me off.  So one night, right when her sleep was the deepest (and I know because I sat and stared unblinking at her for hours) I pounced.  I put my soft furry belly over her face and wrapped my four legs around her face.  Was priceless!!!!  She sat up, tried to pry me off, yelled and I was laughing so hard I let go.  Ruined her sleep.  I loved it!!!  She complained for days.  I periodically would do that, especially when I knew she was exhausted and needed sleep.  Ahhhh, those were the days.  Stupid human, what ever made her think calling me names and throwing me off the bed was safe, Revenge is Mine sayeth the Mighty Ratty Catt, ruler of her universe.  So now the idiot thinks she is a bat...batty is more like it.<br /><br />Mommy was in quite the mood last night.  I did understand, the power company let us go 3 hours without electricity!  Okay, so a tree fell on the power line during a storm...cannot believe they did not pull all resources just to see to my comfort.  After all, I need air conditioning and so does my mommy since being without it and being without water to flush really puts my mommy in a rotten mood.  Mommy's mommy just sat and said it takes time, little does that wicked person know that my first thought was she is an idiot and forgot to pay the bill.  Glad it was just a tree.  Okay, she has never forgotten but there is always a first time.  The three freaks didn't mind the loss of electricity at all.  Heck, they had their Daddy, God of their World and their butts to lick so for them it was fine.  Can you believe they are so primative they "do their business" outside in the yard.  They are so gross!!!  The idiots even have been known to eat their own waste, they don't know shit from chocolate, stupid, stunted, elongated rodents.<br /><br />Well, suppose I should log off for now before they catch me on the PC.  Inferior beings all, I alone rule!  Until the next postings!</div><br>

		<div class="content">My life is Hell!  I live with the enemy and the enemy's protectors, I am underappreciated, starved, ignored, and mentally abused.  I should kill them all as they sleep, they deserve no better....but wait, let me introduce myself and give you some background so at least here I will get some understanding.<br /><br />My name is Splotches, aka RattyCatt, a beautiful American short-haired tortoise shell cat.  I was born in a house in Grove City OH.  I lived there iin luxury with my mother and litter mates.  Then one day I was kidnapped by a young girl that I have come to call my own and she is my mommy and I am her baby....although lately she hasn't been a good mommy, the bitch has a boyfriend.  Now I like the boyfriend, he is a great back scratcher, but he takes mommy away and mommy spends more time with him.  Never fear, one day, when I am sure I have his trust, I will get even.  I will attack and scratch his beautiful black leather boots, leaving deep grooves where once there was only smooth leather...revenge is sweet.  But enough about that, I came to live with mommy and her mommy, daddy and sister, aka as Beth the Brutal, or Beth the Tormenter.  More about her later too.  There was a small dog, his name was Curley and he was a long-hair black and tan dachshund and I liked him.  Years have passed however and my life has taken a turn for a worse the last 3 years.  It started when "mommy" decided she needed a dog to go riding with her in the car and wouldn't a long haired dachshund be perfect....NO WAY...but she comes home with the ugly red creature called Oscar.  He is young and I try to make him understand that I reign supreme but the boy doesn't have much between the ears.  Life has changed and cannot get worse until (dramatic music) it comes...a half brother to Oscar, his name is Sammie, I call him psycho Sam because he is a nervous little dog but that only makes him more defensive and worse, he even has the nerve to CHASE ME!!!, me the RattyCatt, ruler of my universe.  Life settles into a routine or so I think and then diasaster strikes, his name is Maximus, Max the Mangler I call him, a red and black brindle dachshund with a hunting instinct and the idiot thinks I am prey......so many stories to tell.  However, for now I must close.  Glad to meet all of you and hope you enjoy this brief overview of my Life in the Bowels of Hell.....me, the ruler supreme, mommy, the boyfriend, mommy's mommy and daddy, mommy's sister and of course, the demons, the hell hounds, the tormentors, Oscar, Sammie and Max.  Have to run now, really run...but will post again soon.  Stay tuned!</div><br>
