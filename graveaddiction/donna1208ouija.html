On December 20, 2008 I received an e-mail from Donna E. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I used to live by some railroad tracks, before I moved. When I lived there, they were literally only 20 feet away from my house; they ran straight through my backyard. When my cousin and I were about 14-15 years old, in about 2004-2005, we decided to try out the Ouija board my mom bought me. So we got the board and a flashlight, and lit up the board so it would glow. Then we went outside and sat on the train tracks.
<br><br>
Some background info: There was a set of twins who used to live in my old house. They were about 7-8 years old when one of them died. They were both little girls who were playing on the tracks. A train came through, and the one girl tells the other to run. She takes off and is unharmed, but the other is hit and killed. This happened in the 1880's.
<br><br>
So we are sitting on the tracks, asking if anyone is there. Then finally, after a few minutes, we get a YES. We continue to ask about age, sex, and name. Then we ask how she died, why she is here, and if she is scared. She wouldn't really say much. But then we asked her to show herself...the tracks started shaking, we heard a whistle, and then saw the train light. We jumped up and ran out of the way. But there was no train there!  Then I saw her, the little girl. She was mangled and bloody. She had chunks of skin missing off her face and arms. Her eyes looked like water. She scared me, so I told my cousin to run.
<br><br>
We ran inside and cuddled together for safety. We asked my mom if she had heard a train, and she said no. I still see the girl all the time. I have tried to talk to her, but she just points in the direction of the railroad tracks. It has been about 4 years now, and she is still with me. I have been in and out of treatment centers, and she came with me. You could see the train tracks from my window in one place, and she would point at them even though it was a different town. I still see her even now, 4 years and over 100 miles away. It's as though she has stayed with me for a reason. A few friends and I are going to be getting together in a few days to use the same Ouija board. It actually hasen't been used since this experience. But we are going to try and contact her again, and get some information on her. I still haven't told my mom that I can see her, but I will eventually.
