Old Blue wasn't the first of Mark's 
cars that I had ridden in, but my best story comes from my ride in Old Blue.  I had ridden in 
Mark's &quot;Old Gray Buick&quot;, in &quot;The Brown Beast&quot;, and in his best car, &quot;The Olds&quot;.  However, I 
wasn't the first person to ride in any of those cars, other people from our team at work had 
beat me to it.  So when Mark said that he was bringing &quot;Old Blue&quot; up to Columbus I wanted to 
be sure I was the first person on Project Focus to ride in it.

First, maybe I should tell you a bit 
more about Mark and his cars.  Mark still owns all of the cars he's ever had since high school.  
I forget how many, but it's quite a few.  All of them are pretty old, the newest is a mid-80's 
model.  And they are all GM vehicles.  He won't drive anything but GM (I can relate to that!).  
We all give him a hard time about his cars, everyone's always bugging him about buying something 
newer, maybe something from the 90's!  But he won't do it. (<i>update May, 2003 - Mark finally got a new car!!  He bought a 1999 Monte Carlo, the &quot;Maroon Monster&quot;</i>)
<br><br>
Anyway, back to Old Blue.  Mark 
finally brought Old Blue up here back in April.  And he let me ride in it first!!  Old Blue 
looked awful!!!  It had been &quot;out to pasture&quot; at his dad's house for some time before he brought 
it up here, and there were grass clumps on the sides.  The vinyl stuff at the back of the car was peeling off.  The ceiling inside had fallen down so Mark had stapled it back up to the roof in a pattern and painted the staples blue!  It was the dustiest car I had ever seen.  Very few of the gadgets inside worked, and it burned lots and lots of gasoline!  He decided to take me home one night, but since I live so close to work I would not be able to experience the raw, unleashed power of Old Blue, a 1981 Monte Carlo.  So we decided to head out I-70 towards Hilliard.  It was a rainy night, and it was around 4:00 or 4:30 PM so traffic was quite heavy.  We were driving in the middle lane and I was busy talking when Mark looked at me and said &quot;It stopped&quot;.  He said it so calmly that I kept rambling on until it hit me that he was talking about Old Blue stopping....Old Blue died in the middle lane on 70!!!!!!!!  I went crazy, and Mark remained calm the whole time.  He pushed the gas pedal and turned the key a bunch and somehow managed to get it started again.   But to be safe we pulled into the far right lane.  Well, the guy in the old white van behind us must have thought we cut him off and he passed us on the right (yep, off the road!) and cut us off.  I thought it was over, but then Mark reached under his seat and pulled out this big metal club thingy.  He shook it and said something like &quot;I should have pulled this out on him&quot;.  I pictured the guy in the van being some sort of psycho with road rage seeing the club and pulling out a gun and shooting us.  But we were lucky!  I guess I wouldn't have been so shocked by the club incident if I thought Mark was a violent person, but he is always so calm, laid back, and non-violent I couldn't believe he carried a club in his car!  He assured me that he would never use it unless it was for self defense.  Anyway, we managed to make it to Mark's place without the car dying.  We then switched to the Brown Beast and he took me back to my apartment.  It was quite an adventure, and I must say that I don't know if I'd like to take another ride in Old Blue.  I think that was 
my last!
