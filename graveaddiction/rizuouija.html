On April 19, 2007 I received an e-mail from Rizu about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Prior to today, I have only had the board work once for me. This was when I was with Chris and Bev after our theatre production last week on Friday, April 13, 2007. We were at Chris's house, and we managed to get ahold of one child named 3D who was 3, and someone named Sete, age 73, who spoke no English. We had made plans to try it today after school, before we had the call for our theatre production for the night. However, during the day, my friends, Rachel, Lauren, Gilly, and I, were bored, and decided to do it. All of us, except Gilly, had tried it at my house with no success. So I went and got a pass to go to my car, where I got the board, which was conveniently stuck in a bag.
<br><br>
The four of us were in this closet type room that is connected to the art room, leading into our dark room. Three other girls came in (this is an all girl's Catholic school), and started to watch. Gilly, Rachel, and I set it up on a stool, and placed our fingers on the planchette. Lauren took over in the writing area, in case it spelled something weird. We took turns asking if anyone was there. Eventually, it said yes. The others watching were kind of freaked out, but they had used a board themselves before, so knew what to expect. Next we asked its name, and it was Naomi. She was nineteen and graduated in 2002. We asked if she had ever had Mr. Lube (art teacher) as a teacher. She said yes. Next we were asking where she was from and she said ZNMA. She stopped talking, and we asked if there was someone she didn't like in the room. She spelled out L-A-U-R-E-N. Everyone started laughing and said, &quot;Get out Lauren, she doesn't like you.&quot;  We asked Naomi if she was glad Lauren left. She said yes. We asked why she didn't like Lauren. She said: &quot;Shez a moron.&quot;  We asked if she didn't like anyone else in the room, and Naomi spelled out M-E-G. We thought she meant Megan, who was one of the girls watching, but Naomi said no, and then we asked why, she spelled out ZOMBIE, and then started spelling that ZNMA again. Soon, Mr. Lube came in and we had to end the session quickly. We made sure to put the board on the stool again before leaving and say goodbye.
<br><br>
Some of us went to the library to look at the yearbooks from 2002. There weren't any Naomis. However, we had also asked Mr. Lube if he had known a Naomi from 2002 and he said yes. So we weren't sure whether or not to believe Naomi. We went back to the art room again, and started it again. We got in contact with Naomi again, and asked if she was mad. She said no. We
apologized for leaving so suddenly, and she said it was ok. We then just asked Naomi random questions such as what was someone's middle name. She spelled out my middle name, which is not a common one. Very few know it.  However, as we asked more questions, she would go back to the ZNMA, and whenever we touched around why she left school or didn't like Meg, or
touchy subjects, she would do the same. It was eventually time to go to English, so everyone else left and we said goodbye to Naomi. However, Lauren, Rachel, and I decided to go into the actual dark room and try to talk to someone else. We got a hold of a spirit named Paige Ramirez. She was 35 and graduated in 1951. We asked if we could talk to her later, and she
said yes. So we said goodbye and went to English.
<br><br>
Since we were watching a movie, and since our teacher had left us with one to simply check on us, we continued to try to talk with the board. Naomi came back, and she soon started making no sense and continuously going to ZNMA.  She would also start to spell something that might be correct, and then go to the ZNMA. Nothing really interesting happened until after school. Rachel, Bev, Keith, and I went up to the top of the stairwell in the dorm building.  Up there, we asked who was there and the board said MAMA. I don't remember everything we asked, but eventually we discovered it was actually Naomi
again. As we talked, we discovered she had killed someone, whom she called MOM. She went back to ZNMA, and finally, I noticed she changed the pattern to ZAMN, making a figure eight. All of us kind of freaked and asked if she was evil. She said yes. We asked if she was following us. She said yes. We asked if she could follow us away from the school, and we got a no. So there was some relief there. I asked if Naomi wanted to hurt us, she said no. We asked if she liked us and she said yes. We started to get freaked out, and said goodbye and flipped the board, when Naomi started the figure eight
pattern again. We all went downstairs and outside, to do it by where our theatre production is.
<br><br>
Naomi was there again. We discovered she pretended she was a kid. Then we asked random questions like who sings Freak on a Leash and what was Rachel's favorite band. It answered accurately with Korn and Nine Inch Nails. Rachel and Keith left cause they had work, but Chris had finally joined me and Bev. We ended up asking stuff about god. We asked if there was a god. Naomi said yes. Was she in purgatory? She said yes. Could she get to heaven? Yes. How? QA. I asked if she meant questions and answers, and she said yes. We also asked if she knew Paige from the dark room, and she said yes. We asked if she was good, and Naomi replied yes. Again, we asked if Naomi wanted to hurt us and she said no. I asked, &quot;Do you promise on god?&quot;, And she said yes. So I believed her. Eventually, we had to stop for theatre time, and so I put the board away. Then my friend Robert ended up blessing the board with his rosary or something weird like that. Me, Bev, and Chris were all pretty freaked out because Naomi had been following all afternoon, and was making that figure eight. Because when I thought about the original pattern, ZNMA, I thought: four corners, or a very wide eight. Cause she would repeat it. Anyway, I'm taking the board tomorrow again, and hopefully we can talk to someone else. We're definitely gonna try to talk to Paige. Because she's supposed to be good, even though Naomi doesn't like her.
<br><br>
I'm also bringing a form of protection as well, just to be safe. Naomi could always be lying about not wanting to hurt us. Also, has anyone else ever experienced the ZNMA thing?? Just curious.
<br><br><br>
If you've experienced the board spelling out ZNMA and would like to tell Rizu about it, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a>.  I'll be happy to forward your e-mail on!
