On January 22, 2009 I received an e-mail from Maikol A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

In June 1994 my cousins and I (ranging in ages from 14 to 25) sat down one evening in the living room and started to play the Ouija.  It was my first time ever.  One young woman from our childhood had died, and we tried to contact her.  Her name was &quot;Blanca.&quot;  Here's what happened (the session was in Spanish, but I will translate into English to the best of my memory).
<br><br>
Us: Blanca are you there?  Blanca?<br>
Board: (starts to move after a few minutes)  Yes<br>
<br>
Board: What do you want?<br>
<br>
Us: We want to talk to you.<br>
Board: Go ahead<br>
<br>
Us: How do we know you are Blanca?<br>
Board: Car accident  (she indeed had died in a car accident)<br>
<br>
Us: Alright!  So how are you there?<br>
Board: In peace<br>
<br>
Us: Nice!  Do you miss this world?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Why?<br>
Board: Because of you<br>
<br>
Us: Why us?  We liked you.<br>
Board: You have bothered me<br>
<br>
Us: Sorry<br>
Board: (silent)<br>
<br>
Us: Can we ask you things?<br>
Board: Fuck you<br>
<br>
Us: Why did you say such a bad thing, Blanca?<br>
Board: I'm not her<br>
<br>
Us: Who are you then?<br>
Board: Something big<br>
<br>
Us: Where's Blanca?<br>
Board: Right here besides me<br>
<br>
Us: Let her speak to us.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
At this point my teenage cousin, who was in the kitchen, walks toward the living room and asks outloud. &quot;What national team is going to win the World Cup?&quot;<br>
<br>
Board: Go to work you son of a bitch if you want money.<br>
<br>
Us:  Why are you rude?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Let us speak to Blanca.<br>
Board: Do it<br>
<br>
Us: Blanca, are you there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Talk to us.<br>
<br>
At this point the curtains of the apartment start to flow with no wind, and the windows open and we heard dishes being misplaced in the kitchen.  We felt terrorized, and all of us sat down on the couch and huddled together.<br>
<br>
Us: Okay Blanca, go away.  We don't want to talk to you anymore.<br>
Board: No, I will stay here (more noises in the apartment, and a 10-year-old girl starts to cry hysterically)<br>
<br>
Us: See what you did?  You are scaring Jessica, go away.<br>
Board: I will not go away until you pray to me the &quot;Rosemary&quot; (and another Catholic prayer, which I don't remember at the moment)<br>
<br>
Nobody knew how to pray or the letters of the paryers, and the noises continued in the apartment.  For 20 agonizing minutes we huddled on the couch until our aunt came back from work in Manhattan.  Since she's a devout Catholic, she prayed the rosaries and the spirit finally went away.
