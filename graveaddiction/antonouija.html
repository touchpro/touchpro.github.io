On March 1, 2006 I received an e-mail from Anton about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Here is my first ouija story.  I used a Psychic Circle board and I did it alone.  I have always been a very spiritual person and have strong psychic energy, which the spirits often mention!
<br><br>
I use a tape recorder in every seance I do so I can remember them word for word.
<br><br>
<i>I had tried once with my cousin Tash and the indicator only slightly moved, we stupidly asked for a sign and about a minute later a bottle of whiskey fell off the fridge and smashed on the floor!  The bottle was nowhere near the edge!  Her unit was haunted after that...we didn't close the board as we thought nothing had come through.</i>
<br><br>
Anyway here is my first successful try:
<br><br>
Me: Is there any spirit who would like to talk with me?<br>
<i>No movement...for five minutes, during which I asked several times.  Then all of a sudden the indicator very slowly started moving to...</i><br>
'YES'<br>
<i>I was totally scared as it felt SO weird having this thing move seemingly by itself!</i><br><br>
Me: Who am I speaking with?<br>
Board: 'YES'...<i>then a long minute later</i>...HLEN<br><br>
Me: Is that Helen?<br>
Board: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: What country did you live in when you were alive?<br>
Helen: NEWZELND<br><br>
Me: Is that New Zealand?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Helen: RAPEGNGRAPE<br><br>
Me: Oh my God, is that gang rape?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me I'm sorry to hear that Helen, that's awful.<br>
Helen: OK<br><br>
Me: Do you have any mesages for me Helen?<br>
Helen: 'YES'  WATCH<br><br>
Me: Watch what?  <i>**I got scared here as I thought it may be some sort of threat or something!**</i><br>
Helen: LOST<br><br>
Me: Oh, is this about my missing watch?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: Where is my watch?  <i>**Relief!  I had been agonizing for ages over the new watch I had which went missing**</i><br>
Helen: TASH<br><br>
Me: Does Tash have my watch?<br>
Helen: 'YES' UNDR BED<br><br>
Me: Is the watch under her bed?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: Does Tash know about the watch?<br>
Helen: 'YES' STEAL<br><br>
Me: Thank you, Helen.<br>
Helen: 'NO'<br><br>
Me: Helen, change of subject, is Heaven real?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: Will I go to Heaven?<br>
Helen: 'YES' IF GOD<br><br>
Me: Did you mean good? Go to 'Yes' if you meant good.<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: Great!  Are you in Heaven?<br>
Helen: 'NO'<br><br>
<i>I couldnt think of any more to say and I had a strong impression Helen wanted to finish up.</i><br><br>
Me: Helen, do you want to finish up now and leave?<br>
Helen: 'YES'<br><br>
Me: OK, thanks Helen for talking to me.  Goodbye<br>
Helen: 'GOODBYE'<br>
<br>
<i>The next morning I went to visit Tash and I asked her about the watch.  She claimed she didn't have a clue about it, so I told her about my seance and what the spirit had said.  We looked under her bed (it was a mess!!) and there was my watch, Helen was right!!!</i>&quot;
