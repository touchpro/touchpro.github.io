On February 16, 2006 I received an e-mail from Matt Butler about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I'm fascinated by ouija boards, and have recently purchased one off ebay.  It hasn't arrived yet. They have been used in my family for years. Practically all of my family members have used them. I was talking to my gran and she told me a story about them that was true, and what happened to her.
<br><br>
They had ordered a car from a company that sells them over the phone. They had ordered a white car.  Later that night they played with a ouija board (for the first time) and asked what colour their car will be. The reply they got was &quot;green.&quot; They thought the game was rubbish and put it away. Two weeks later the car was being delivered at the house. But it wasn't a white car...it was green! It just goes to show users of the 'game' should never underestimate its powers. And the game should be played with caution.
<br><br>
My mum is really angry with my dad for letting him buy it for me off ebay. She used one once and her experience with it was unpleasant. She says her friend ended up crying and was emotionally scarred. She won't tell me more than that. And she is still annoyed we bid for it. According to her, &quot;No good can come of them.&quot;
