On May 1, 2009 I received an e-mail from Dana about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This all happened when I was 17, and I'm 54 now. I remember it like was yesterday.
<br><br>
My friend Chuck and I had just graduated from High School and were bored, most of the time. He got the idea to borrow a neighbor's Ouija board. My dad was a minister, and very strict, and would have been mortified to know we were playing with an Ouija board. He thought there were an &quot;instrument of the devil.&quot;
<br><br>
Anyway, we started asking it all kinds of questions. The jist of it is, that after the perfunctory normal-type questions, it started telling me things about my life. For example, I worked in a factory, and knew I was getting transferrred to the &quot;Frame Shop.&quot; I asked it if I'd be transferred soon (already knowing the answer.) It slowly spelled out &quot;F...&quot; and then just an &quot;S.&quot; I said to Chuck, I was afraid it was going to spell &quot;Frame Shop.&quot; Chuck said &quot;FS&quot; IS Frame Shop. That really creeped me out.
<br><br>
Then we asked it if the trip I was going to make to Los Angeles was going to be successful. It said &quot;no.&quot; We asked why. It said &quot;Car Crash.&quot; I started getting REALLY creeped out. To cut the story short, it predicted the DAY I would die in car crash, and we quickly put the board away.
<br><br>
I ended up NOT going on the trip, and stayed home. Around that time, we started seeing faces in the fireplace, and soon after all this, as I was recording myself playing the piano, weird high piano notes showed up on the tape afterwards. Notes that I could NOT have played.
<br><br>
We never messed with the board again.
