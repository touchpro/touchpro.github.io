I know I've been bad about blogging AGAIN!  And I'm sorry to say that you're not going to get a long post from me tonight...my poor plants are out on the patio crying for water!  But before I go and water them, I wanted to let you all know that I worked hard last night and even a little tonight to get the photos from this past weekend's Cincinnati trip added to the site!  <a href="newstuff.html">Click here</a> to visit the &quot;updates&quot; page to see the list of new pages.  There are only three new cemeteries, but I think they're pretty exciting updates.  Especially the 68 photos from Spring Grove Cemetery :)  I already thanked him on each of the individual pages, but thanks again to <a href="http://straightmute.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Wes</a> for visiting these cemeteries with me...he's a great tour guide!<br><br>

So today I turned a quarter of a century old.  I really don't feel very different though :)<br /><br />I did take a half day off work today, but not because it was my birthday.  I had my six-month dental checkup down in Lancaster.  It's been many, many years since I last heard those dreaded words, so I can't complain too much...I had TWO small cavities.  This is the first time I've had to have fillings since my old dentist retired, so I was extremely nervous.  See, my old dentist was the greatest - he never had to numb me before doing the fillings.  Since I'm needle phobic that was terrific.  I knew I wasn't going to be that lucky with the new doctor.  I went out to the front desk to schedule a return visit, and the receptionist told me that they actually had a cancellation and they could do the fillings right away.  That was pretty cool actually, saved me another 1/2 day off work!  But even though that was great, the fillings weren't.  He gave me three shots of novocaine on the left side, and decided that he might not have to numb the other side for the second cavity...since I just told you I have needle phobia, you know I didn't protest :)  The shot hurt like hell, and I hated the numb feeling.  He probably should have numbed the other side too, because the drilling was extremely painful, but I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I was able to get through it without a whimper.  So tonight my whole mouth is sore and hurts.  I took some pain medicine, I hope it kicks in soon.  Definitely wasn't how I planned on spending my birthday, that's for sure!<br /><br />My parents wanted to take me out to dinner, but since I couldn't feel the left side of my mouth, my bottom lip, or my tongue I decided that might not be such a good idea!  I told them we could celebrate my birthday later.  I did stay at their house and played with my little brothers (the 3 wiener dogs) for almost an hour.<br /><br />When I got home I talked with my friend Chrissie on the phone.  She really wanted me to meet her and Jos for dinner at Mac's in the Short North.  My mouth was still numb, but since the restaurant is so close (within walking distance) I just couldn't refuse.  I hadn't seen either of them for ages so it was a lot of fun to catch up.  And they were too kind...they bought me a birthday present!  Gargoyle bookends, they're really cool :)  Chrissie also gave me a cool birthday card with the gift, she always finds the PERFECT cards!  Hopefully it won't be another two months before I get to see them again!!!<br /><br />My coworkers were really nice today too, they took me out for lunch.  I tried to buy my own, but they just wouldn't let me.  Just one more reason why I say my  coworkers are the best!<br /><br />Anyway, I really should check my e-mail since I haven't checked it since 11AM...but I'm not going too since I feel so awful.  Plus the Excedrin PM is kicking in and it's difficult to keep my eyes open!  <br><br>

I'm sitting at the computer, telling myself I really need to work on this week's site update.  But I just don't feel motivated...it'll probably be tomorrow night before I finish the update :)<br /><br />While I sit here thinking about updating the site, I'm listening to Slipknot - <i>Iowa</i>.  Just listening to the CD makes me excited about next Tuesday...Slipknot's new CD comes out then!  Slipknot is one of my top ten favorite groups. I especially like listening to them when I'm having a bad day at work, it sort of cheers me up :)  But even though I'm excited about their new CD, I'm even more excited that Nine Inch Nails is releasing a new CD later this year!!  <br /><br />Wow, I really am unmotivated tonight.  I can't even think of anything exciting to blog about.  Work has been busy, and that's really all I can say about this week.  Tomorrow I have a checkup at the dentist, so I'm taking a 1/2 day so I can make it down to Lancaster in time for the appointment.  I'm sure I've written it before, but I really need to find a dentist closer to Columbus.  I've lived up here for a little over 4 years now, I have no excuse for not finding a good one around here.  After the dentist appointment, I'm driving to my parents place so they can take me out for my birthday dinner.  It's nice, but I told them they really don't have to since I'm not big on celebrating birthdays.  But there's no way I could talk my mom out of it!<br /><br />Anyway, back to the website update!<br><br>

Who would think that an automated testing position could be so dangerous?  I always thought I had a pretty safe job...until today anyway!<br /><br />I was sitting in the lab with Pat working on some test scripts.  He was playing with a pen he was holding, and he managed to drop it.  The pen came close to hitting me, so I made some smart ass comment about him throwing things at me.  He then said something like &quot;No, if I meant to throw it at you I'd do this&quot; and he flung it at me...and the pen hit me right in the eye!  I found the situation absolutely hilarious, and even though Pat was laughing hard he did keep apologizing.  Maybe Mark was correct on Monday night when he compared Pat and I to a couple of six year olds :)<br /><br />Really, that was the most exciting thing that happened today.  Well, take that back...I did go to lunch with Ben (my old manager) today, that was fun.  He was able to get me caught up on some of the going-ons in my old area.  And it was fun to hear stories about his dog pulling his son's socks off and eating them!  His dog eats EVERYTHING!  Ben and his wife have had to call Time Warner twice to replace the cable that Hershey ate :)<br /><br />Oh, and how could I forget...a note for Kate - Mark is speaking to me again!  He was really angry yesterday, but he seemed to calm down a lot this afternoon.  Work can be so dramatic sometimes!!!<br><br>

Tonight was a lot of fun...it was the weekly dinner and a cemetery night with Kate!  But tonight was even cooler, we added the ouija board and <i>Family Plots</i> to the agenda!<br /><br />We started out with dinner at Baja Fresh...Mexican is always good :)  Then we were off to a couple cemeteries.  There were two in Grove City that neither of us had been to - Thomas Seeds Cemetery and Old Concord Cemetery.  I think I got some good photos, but it'll be a few weeks before I get them added to the site.  I have eight cemeteries to add before I get around to these two new ones!  Guess you can probably figure out what I'll be working on tomorrow night...resizing photos and creating new pages of course!<br /><br />After we finished up exploring the cemeteries it was back to my place.  We used the ouija board for about thirty minutes.  I'll be adding that to the site too, hopefully with this week's update (either Thursday or Friday).  I've been getting a lot of updates from my loyal fans asking me to hurry up and update that section of the site :)<br /><br />Around 9:00PM Mark came over to watch <i>Family Plots</i> with us...I was actually a bit surprised that he even came.  I was glad he did though!  During commercials we talked about the new site I'm going to help him get up and running (sorry, I'm not allowed to go into any details!!), and we talked about how aggravating Pat and I are at work...he even compared us to six year olds.  Too funny!  <br /><br />Overall it was an extremely fun night.  I'm totally exhausted now, I need to get everything ready for work tomorrow and get some sleep!<br><br>

Today was quite a fun and busy day...<br /><br />I woke up around 6:50AM this morning.  Usually when I wake up that early on a Saturday morning I try to go back to sleep (and never succeed, I just end up laying there for an hour or so), but today I got up and got ready for an exciting morning.  Yesterday at work my friend/coworker Mark said that he was planning to go to the big flea market at the Great Southern drive-in (which is obviously on the south side of Columbus).  He asked if I wanted to go too since he knows I love flea markets, and of course I said I would love to go!  He called around 8:15 this morning and told me he'd pick me up around 9:00.  He's always awesome about being on time and today was no exception.  He hadn't been over to my place in ages (he hates the area I live in, it's too old or something and he thinks it's dangerous...even though it really isn't) so I invited him in to show him all the new vintage/antique things I've collected in the past couple years since he had visited me.  Then we jumped in the Brown Beast and headed to the flea market.  <br /><br />Mark had told me that the flea market had all sorts of junk...he was right!  I absolutely LOVED it!!!!  I found a couple coppercraft things to add to my collection, and Mark found the 1/2 inch stubby wrench he was looking for so he can fix the transmission line on the Brown Beast.   I also got to pet the cutest German Shepherd puppies that were in the back of a vendor's truck :)  Of course Mark didn't pet them since he hates dogs now...which is a long story I'm not going to tell!<br /><br />We grabbed lunch and then Mark dropped me off at my place.  I then jumped in the truck and headed for the Ohio BMV to renew my registration and get a new license since they both expire on the 19th.  I made it to the BMV 10 minutes before they closed, that was lucky.  Since it was so close to closing time there weren't a lot of people and I ended up NOT having to wait in line.  That's a first!  My new driver's license picture is absolutely terrible, I already miss my old one (since it was actually a halfway decent picture).<br /><br />After the BMV adventure I was off to Meijer's to pick up a bag of potting soil.  I also wanted to get a new bulb for the truck, one of the daytime running lights is out.  And wouldn't ya know it, they had tons of bulbs but were totally sold out of the one I needed.  Oh well, guess I'll have to go to an auto parts store tomorrow.<br /><br />When I got home I planted some more flower pots on the patio and mulched my little flower bed.  Then I came inside and laid down on the couch.  I must be really tired, because I fell asleep for about thirty minutes.  I am never able to take naps, I have a terrible time falling asleep during the day.  <br /><br />Now I'm off to do some laundry.  And I suppose I should think about eating something for dinner since it is 8PM :)<br><br>

Getting real mail from the post office is exciting...it's even more exciting when one of the items delivered is a box stuck in the screen door...and it's even more exciting yet when you see that The Ohio Genealogical Society is the sender.  Why would getting a package from them be so exciting?<br /><br /><b>My copy of <i>Ohio Cemeteries: 1803-2003</i> arrived tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b><br /><br />Directions and info for over 15,000 cemeteries from all eighty-eight counties!  Over 920 pages!  <a href="./solstice/index.html" target="_blank">Kate</a>, we're going to have way too much fun cemetery exploring this summer :)  Most of the directions seem to be pretty detailed, and they're all arranged by county and township.  I'm just way too excited about this, aren't I?!<br><br>

My day at work was good (which is the norm these days), so I'm not going to write about the same boring details...I'll skip ahead to my evening...<br /><br />I met up with Kate tonight, it was our &quot;Dinner and a Cemetery&quot; night, which has sort of become a tradition.  We usually meet a couple times a month, but I have a feeling it will become a weekly tradition this summer.  Kate is a fun person to explore cemeteries with since she honestly enjoys them as much as I do.  So anyway, tonight we ended up going to three...the only three we could find on the Troy Township, Delaware County map.  I was super impressed because we didn't even get lost...it's nice to have a navigator in the passenger seat with me!  After we finished visiting the cemeteries we were starved.  We went to Senior Antonio's (of course - that's a tradition now too) and I got my usual, the Enchiladas Zuisas (I'm sure I spelled that wrong).  I also got a margarita tonight since Kate is always telling me how good they are.  Actually, I ended up drinking a little bit more than one margarita...but I'm not going to tell the story since I know Kate is planning to write about it in <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/solstice/" target="_blank">her blog</a>.  I really do recommend <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/solstice/" target="_blank">clicking here</a> to read about it...she usually posts her entries in the afternoon.  Even though I'm not telling the story, I am going to tell you that the little bit of her extra margarita that I chugged down extra fast was really strong...after I drank it I turned around to look at something behind me, and when I turned back around I felt that almost dizzy feeling come over me.  Luckily it had more than enough time to wear off before I drove back to her place.  I'm not one to drink and drive!<br /><br />Oh, I also wanted to mention...if you do end up going to Kate's blog to read the margarita story, be sure to check out the new photos of her cute little dog, Cordy.  I just posted them a few minutes ago, they're really adorable :)<br /><br />Now I think it's time for me to call it a night and get some sleep so my mind can function at work tomorrow!<br><br>

I must have drank just enough tonight at happy hour to make myself really tired...I feel totally exhausted right now.  I did have fun though, and it'll be nice to fall asleep easily instead of tossing and turning like I usually do.  So even though I had a couple things I wanted to write about, you're going to have to wait until tomorrow when I feel more awake :)<br><br>

I'll have to try and watch what I write this morning, I don't want to encourage more conversations in my comments like yesterday's :)  Just kidding, you all (my blog friends) make me laugh!<br /><br />Yesterday was a pretty good day at work.  I love being able to write that, I still can't believe I've been in this new area for over three months now!<br /><br />Last night Dave called and asked if I was up for some cemetery exploring.  As if I'd ever turn that down! :)  We ended up going to three: one near Sunbury/Galena (Red Bank Cemetery), one outside Westerville (St. Paul Lutheran Cemetery - the haunted Cubbage Road cemetery), and one in Gahanna (Mifflin Cemetery).  They were all great, although I'd have to say Red Bank Cemetery was my favorite since it was the oldest.  We did have a little adventure in Mifflin Cemetery though.  No, we didn't see the lion that is supposedly running loose in Gahanna (I really doubt there really is one, I bet it was that coyote they caught).  We were walking through the cemetery when we both heard a rustling sound coming from the wooded ravine that borders the cemetery.  We looked over and saw this cute, medium sized black and white dog.  It had a collar with tags, but it looked like it had been roaming around outside for a long time, it was a little beat up.  I tried calling it over, but it was too afraid.  Finally it ended up running back over to the ravine.  I heard it rustling through the weeds, and all of a sudden we saw it run back over to us with a gigantic tree branch in it's mouth.  It started jumping around in front of us, I could tell it wanted to play.  I grabbed the branch and almost fell over when it started to pull...it was one tough dog!  I finally got the stick away from it and then the dog got really excited.  It wanted to play fetch!  It was too cute, we ended up playing with it for a long time!  Dave and I both tried to grab it's collar so we could see the tags, but it jumped back anytime we got too close to it.  Poor little dog, it was terrified.  I hope it was just lost, I'd be sick to think that someone dumped it!<br /><br />After we finished cemetery exploring, we were both starved so we got Chinese.  Then we went back to my place and watched the National Geographic channel!  A show called <i>Scorpions and Lizards</i> was on, I love shows like that.  Yeah, I'm a nerd :)<br /><br />Tonight I think my team at work is going to happy hour to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  Should be fun!  <br><br>

Can you believe I'm actually keeping my promise to update the blog?!  I admit I've been terrible about posting lately, it just seems like I always have a million things going on anymore.  Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing since I'm the type who gets bored easily!<br /><br />Nothing too exciting happened last week, with the exception of Thursday night.  Thursday night I went over to Mark's house (the Brown Beast's owner...the LGB's owner would sound so much cooler!  See the post from 4/21 if you don't know what I'm talking about).  I didn't just go over there to enjoy his company though...the main reason for going over to his house was to help him weed.  He had been bitching about how bad the weeds in his flower beds were for several weeks.  He even asked me if it'd be OK to mix gas in with the mulch to kill them...yeah, I explained that would be pretty scary since not only would the gas kill all of the flowers, but it'd also be a fire hazard!!!  Anyway, I was expecting the flower beds to look absolutely terrible.  But Mark was really exaggerating, there were just a few weeds growing in the mulch from the lawn.  They were super easy to pull out.  Here's a couple pics of the <i>terrible</i> weeds:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/weeding4.jpg"><br><br><img src="./miscpic/weeding3.jpg"></center><br /><br />Even though I actually did have fun weeding (yeah, I know there must be something wrong with me if I enjoy weeding), the best part of the night were all the conversations I had with Mark and our coworker Pat.  Pat had never been to Mark's house before, so Mark invited him to join us.  That meant I finally got to see Pat's Ford Escort that I had heard such terrible things about.  The exterior wasn't too bad, but the interior was a different story...Jen had told me that it was a mess and she definitely wasn't lying:<br /><br /><center><img src="./miscpic/weeding2.jpg"></center><br /><br />I can't think of anything else interesting that happened last week.  Well, I did take my mom flower shopping for mother's day on Saturday.  After we were done at the greenhouses, she talked me into going to the Hocking Hills Farmer's flea market with her and my dad.  I usually love that flea market, but I was totally disappointed on Saturday...I didn't find a single thing!  Hopefully the big flea market in Springfield that I'm going to with Kate and Amanda on May 15th will be much better!<br /><br />I did start this week off good though.  I was playing around on the internet yesterday evening when I noticed my online friend Dave from Sunbury was logged into YIM.  He found my website several months ago, and we had talked via YIM and e-mail a few times.  I'm always bugging him about Delaware County cemeteries.  Well, we chatted for awhile, then he suggested meeting up for dinner.  And since he let me pick, we had Mexican food of course! :)  We went to this place in Gahanna, I totally can't remember the name of it.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't Senior Antonio's!  Anyway, we had fun talking about all sorts of stuff.  After we were done eating, he suggested going to a movie since there was a theatre within walking distance.  Since I never seem to make time to see movies in theatres there was no way I was passing that up!  We ended up seeing <i>The Punisher</i>, it was awesome!  We both agreed that we'll have to meet up again to explore some cemeteries...we were going to do that last night, but since we didn't end up meeting for dinner until 8:30 that was pretty much ruled out.  Dave was only the 7th or 8th person I've met as a result of the site that I've actually met in person, so I was pretty nervous about meeting him...I was relieved that it went well!  <br /><br />Anyway, that's about all I can think of to write about.  I'm going to try really hard to write again tomorrow too!<br><br>
