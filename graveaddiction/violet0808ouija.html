On August 11, 2008 I received an e-mail from Violet about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This incident happened a while ago. I was in my freshman year of high school. My friends and I were ditching school one day, and we decided to get the ouija board out and mess around a little.  Anyways this girl's house that we were at, it was her board and her parents weren't home at the time. We were asking it basic questions and stuff, like are you a good spirit or bad and really stupid things.  For example, we asked it when my friend lost her virginity, and it gave a date on that and started calling her a bitch and stuff which was really weird because none of us knew when she did. She started freaking out a little, so she stopped playing.
<br><br>
Now it was just myself and the other two girls.  One of the other girls decided to put her crucifix on the planchette, and the cross turned fiery hot like a hot coal on a fire.  It flew across the room and hit the wall...you never saw four girls run out of a room so fast in your life! The one girl who lived there cried and begged us not to leave until her parents got home. We were so scared...I remember before that happened we were all asking it all kinds of questions and stuff.  We were probably getting it all confused and pissed off at the same time.
