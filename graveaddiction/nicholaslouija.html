On May 3, 2007 I received an e-mail from Nicholas about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

At three in the morning we went to an empty squadbay where many claims have been made that people seen and heard &quot;stuff.&quot;  As soon as we entered, we got a bad feeling but still continued to walk.  We kept gettting chills, but we proceeded anyway.  We sat up the board and asked...

Us:  Does anyone wanna talk to us?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  How many people are here?<br>
Board:  6<br>
<br>
Us:  What is your name?<br>
Board:  Qc<br>
<br>
Us:  Is Qc your initials?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  How old were you when you died?<br>
Board:  21<br>
<br>
Us:  How did you die?<br>
Board:  D<br>
<br>
Us:  Did you drown?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Where did you drown?<br>
Board:  S<br>
<br>
Us:  In the swimming pool?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Us:  In the Swamp?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  What part of the swamp?<br>
Board:  Water<br>
<br>
Us:  Where is the swamp?<br>
Board:  Rr<br>
<br>
Us:  Behind the rifle range?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Which one?<br>
Board:  C<br>
<br>
Us:  Chosen?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Us:  Do you only hang out in the squadbay?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Us:  Where else do you?<br>
Board:  S<br>
<br>
Us:  At the swamp?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
We heard a few drops of water like right behind us, so my friend asked me, &quot;Did you hear water drops?&quot;
<br><br>
The board moved to yes.
<br><br>
Then we could hear slight moaning of what sounded like 3 voices, but it was real faint.
<br><br>
We sat there, thinking of another question and it started spelling out my last name but did not finish.
<br><br>
I told my buddy we should go to the swamp and see if anything would happen.
<br><br>
After I said this, the room seemed to get warmer and we could not get any response from the board anymore, so we left.
<br><br>
So we went to the swamp.  I had my digital camera with me, so I figured I would take some pics.
<br><br>
We got out of the car and walked next to the swamp, which is called &quot;Ribbon Creek.&quot; I took a picture - it was dark outside and I used my flash, but when I looked at the screen of my camera to see if it took the pic I saw five white orbs floating about 10 feet from me.  This was enough for me...I got back in the car, but my buddy said we should try to get more, so I got back out. This time I took pics and I saw a few more orbs in different places each time I took the pic, but in the same general area.  When I got back in the car I took a picture right outside my window and saw a large orb with three smaller ones behind it...this was freaky.  Then I took the camera and took a pic over my shoulder into the back seat, and when I looked at it I could see a face in the plexiglass (it's a police car, so it has a plexiglass separator). I showed this to my buddy and everyone else on shift and they all saw it too...that was enough for us to call it a night.
<br><br>
Well, I got on the internet and did a little research...in the 1950's a drill instructor marched his platoon into Ribbon Creek.  Six recruits died, and they were staying in the barracks that we happened to be doing the board in. I don't think we will go back there anytime soon...all the info on the &quot;Ribbon Creek Incident&quot; is available on the net to verify my story. Prior to going to the barracks, my buddy and I had no knowledge of this incident until I researched it.
<br><br>
I don't know if this was real or just my mind, but I heard what I heard and saw what I saw.
