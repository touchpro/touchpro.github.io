On July 19, 2005 I received an e-mail from Besh Marliona about an interesting ouija board experience (but I still don't agree that ouija boards are dangerous!):
<br><br><br>
&quot;We never used an Ouija board before, just did outright readings.  This particular evening a friend of mine wanted to contact a dead uncle. We used his board, and it called relatives out by name, so she knew he was there.  Anyway he (spirit) told her to put the board away we did not need it, and did an old parlor trick he taught her.  We taped a skeleton key to Ruth in the bible, key side down, then taped the bible shut, we put the head of the key or top of it between our fingers, one fingertip under part and the other persons fingertip under part, we started out by saying the alphabet, and when we got to the true loves initials the bible would turn. Thats how it was suppose to work. This was 1986.
<br><br> 
How does an old fragile 110 year old bible that has been taped shut, stay steady, not turn but the key was turning in our fingers, not the bible the key no pages ripped, no bible turn, just that key . I got a cold chill up my spine, something hit the curtain we had put up, the bible flew across the room. I felt something in my stomach and nausea. Like eating a gallon of cold ice cream, but keeping it down.
<br><br>  
Two days later a gun appeared in my hand, I was staying at a relative's house because mine was making noise and scaring me and my kids.  When at this relative's house they had a gun I did not know about, it was in a cupboard, it was in my hand and something was telling me to shoot myself, with my kids in the house. Never had any mental health problems, never had depression, and until that incident never wanted to ever think of hurting myself and this feeling was not from me.  I called some  friends to come and take the gun.  They did and was very surprised at my torment, the next day I told my friend what happened.  She called some pentecostal christian people to come and pray over my home, they put the kids in my car, went inside the house with annointing oil, praying and casting out this thing we had conjured up.  Pictures flew off the walls, statues hit the floor, and the people acted like it was perfectly normal.  When they tried to talk to me my ears were ringing, confounding their speech.  They bopped my ears and got the demon off me. My legs cemented to the floor, something was taken out of me, and I was no longer sick in my stomach, the heavy feeling was pulled out of my body. Then the last part of cleaning the house was the basement, as the lady came up from the basement something cut her, she yelled, quot;You demon get out and you can't hurt me&quot;.  I looked at her legs, and she had cuts on her legs, I mean a lot of them and she had not been out of my sight over 2 or 3 minutes. My house was clean from the evil I had let in that night, but you see it was not my inheritance to be receiving that entity.  It was not for me to invite it in, not a relative, not her relative, but a lying spirit. I learned that you have spirits that are your friends, relatives, guides, and others that are yours to meet and learn from, just like people in your life...how many people walk around your town you will never meet face to face, because you're not meant to. You don't meet them for a good reason. Same with some spirits you're not meant to call them all to you.
<br><br>
I used to do readings and was very good, for about 20 years before that night, after that night I got saved and I did not do any cold readings anymore. I am still a medium and teller, my gifts that were given me, I use for family and friends only.
<br><br> 
My communication is good, but I still feel uneasy using any power of communications that I'm not trained in any longer.  I am now studying with strict guides for missing persons and to solve crime.  That is my calling and my energy can be guided in that direction without difficulty.  I know most people think they can ward off evil by mere free-will.  But when you really get into trouble you need an experienced person to get you out of harm's way. Just like a person with a disease, you go to doctor and then x-ray, hospital you use everyone who is trained in that area to help you find out how to heal your body, and with the spirit it is the same.   Spiritual gifts I can tell you are the same as worldly talents, either God gives you a talent like singing, writing, art, many other gifts and you can use them as he would like or you can use them for your own selfish gains.  If you're a writer and can't sing then why try to Karaoke.  Do you understand, if you can't read or do a spiritual talent don't try it more then once.  If you have talent, and a communication to your spirtual self that you get through meditation and guidance, you don't need a ouija board...the board, cards, beads, stones are just props for you to feel comfortable in what has been given to you as a spiritual gift. When you use props you can be taken in by lies and if anyone communicates and disrespects you its not right.  You would not let anyone disrespect you in this world, if you have any sense, you get away from them. I let something in because I was so desperate to communicate.  Believe me I have plenty of communication everyday now without props, because through prayer and meditation, and love of my spiritual family and kindred spirits I learn to open up to them directly. A ouija board will only hold you back, and keep you from learning the real way to spiritual communication, your own self, your own being as a sourse of communication and if you're doing it right, the call will go through without a hitch, the connection will be strong and you will hear it loud and clear.&quot;
