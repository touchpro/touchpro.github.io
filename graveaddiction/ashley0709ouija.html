On July 7, 2009 I received an e-mail from Ashley about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This happened Thursday of last week. My three friends, Darien, Lauren, Shelby, and I were at a horse show. We were all done showing for the day, and my friend Lauren decided that it would be fun to use the Ouija board she just bought.
<br><br>
Lauren: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Ellen<br>
<br>
Me: Are you evil?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Shelby: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 109<br>
<br>
Me: What did you die of?<br>
Board: Age<br>
<br>
Lauren: Can you tell me what place I will get tomorrow?<br>
Board: yes 3rd<br>
<br>
Me: What place will I get tomorrow?<br>
Board: 2nd<br>
<br>
Shelby: How about me?<br>
Board: 5th<br>
<br>
Darian: Me?<br>
Board: 8th<br>
<br>
(All of those placings ended up being true, except Lauren.  You will read why later on.)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know any evil spirits?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Shelby: What are their names?<br>
Board: Zeb<br>
<br>
Me: Is Zeb here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: This is zeb<br>
<br>
(the planchette was moving very, very fast now)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Ellen told us you were evil.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to hurt any of us?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(Shelby's brother decided to come play, and thought that we were pushing it.  And that it was stupid and retarded.)<br>
<br>
Shelby: Are you mad at my brother?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: What are you going to do to him?<br>
Board: Board hit on head.<br>
<br>
Lauren:  You are going to hit him on the head with a board?<br>
Board: no lauren is<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you going to possess me?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Please don't.<br>
Board: okay<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to someone else?<br>
Board: yes Goodbye<br>
<br>
Shelby: Who is this?<br>
Board: Zane<br>
<br>
Me: Are you evil?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to hurt any of us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who?<br>
Board: you<br>
<br>
Me: You as in me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(I screamed and ran away)<br>
<br>
Shelby: Zane, where are you?<br>
Board: on Ashley (which is my name)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Where is she?<br>
Board: By the food stands<br>
Board: tell her not to run I chase her<br>
<br>
(right then I came back)<br>
<br>
Me: Zane, why are you mad at me?<br>
Board: you are scared<br>
<br>
Me: I'm sorry. I will try not to be scared anymore.<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
(The board was glow in the dark, and Lauren thought it was cool when she scratched her name into it. After she wrote her name with her fingernail on the board a few times, the planchette started to chase her finger when placed in on the board to write her name.)<br>
<br>
Shelby: Are you mad at Lauren?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to hurt her?<br>
Board: I don't want to talk to you<br>
<br>
Me: Okay, I will stop talking.<br>
Board: please<br>
<br>
Shelby: Are you going to hurt Lauren?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Shelby: How?<br>
Board: Fall off horse<br>
<br>
Darien: Is she going to break anything?<br>
Board: leg rib and arm<br>
<br>
Me: Goodbye, Zane.<br>
Lauren- Yes, goodbye.<br>
Board- Goodbye<br>
<br>
(Lauren never fell off her horse because she refused to ride the next day)<br>
<br>
The next day we talked to Zane, Zeb, a spirit named Evil, an alex (who we looked up on Google and was real), and Ellen again.
