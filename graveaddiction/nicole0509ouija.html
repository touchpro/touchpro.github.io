On May 17, 2009 I received an e-mail from Nicole L. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend asked how old her spirit is, and it said 666. It said she was Daivid's daughter (her father's name).  We asked who was Daived Ice (the spirit's name), and it said that it is the devil.  We asked who the devil's wife was, and it spelled my friend's mom's name. Ice said she and her mom are always with me to try to protect me. I feel ice on my arm all the time. I feel her mom on my spine when danger is around me. Ice said she was four when she died, and she has green eyes. She said she loves me, and when we die she's going to be my love. She also said my soul is evil.  My friend who was also playing has a good soul and has four angels with her. I have seen Ice's mom before when I played.  I asked why, and she said it was because my dad's soul was trying to hurt me and she was protecting me. I asked it to touch my palm, and it said that it can't...it is against the rules. Then I felt something on my arm, and I asked if it was her.  She said yes, and I turned my head in the direction and asked if I was looking at her.  She said yes.
<br><br>
So is it bad to have ice and her mom with me? Before this, I saw her in my dreams as the girl I was in love with. They have been with me for a while, so is it bad? If so, what can I do?
<br><br><br>

If anyone has any suggestions for Nicole, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on to her.
