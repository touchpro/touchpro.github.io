On July 11, 2009 I received an e-mail from JimBob about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Hello, My name is James (JimBob), and I am 15. I've spent a lot of time looking up ouija tips and rules, so I know how powerful this tool is. Anyway, about 3 or 4 weeks ago my friends and I (Cozzie, Sean, Luke, Mitch) got together to use the board. There were also about 3-4 other people watching.  We were using Cozzie's ouija (real, not homemade).  I didn't record this, so I am trying to remember this encounter to the best of my abilities. Cozzie was host, so he asked most of the questions...
<br><br>
Cozzie: Is there anybody here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Are you male?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: What is your name?<br>
Board: Acbqrsey<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Could you please repeat that?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: Dyjsyfmgo<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Okay... how old were you when you passed?<br>
Board: 27<br>
<br>
Cozzie: What year did you pass?<br>
Board: 4027<br>
<br>
(We were thinking oh great, we got ourselves a jokester)<br>
<br>
Board: BC<br>
<br>
(All of us stopped in amazement for a second...we were talking to someone from 6000 years ago!)<br>
<br>
Myself: Wait, so does that mean you can't spell in English?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Mitch: But you can answer yes or no questions?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Luke: Do you have a message for any of us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Okay who?<br>
Board:  (pointed to Luke)<br>
<br>
Myself: Luke?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Okay, this is gonna be hard.  Okay, we got to try...TRY to figure out this message with yes or no questions.  Do you mind if we take a while?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Myself: Does it have something to do with Luke's lifestyle?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Myself: Is it a warning?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Myself: Does it involve technology?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Luke's technology?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sean: Is it new? Has Luke received or bought it recently?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Luke: Do I have it with me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Daniel (Watching, not participating): Luke, didn't you just get a drum set for your birthday?<br>
Luke: Yes, is it my drum set?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Myself (a question which I was laughed at for): Do you like the drum set?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sean: Do you want Luke to learn the drums?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Was that the message?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(We decided to ask some questions about him)<br>
<br>
Myself: Were you a slave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sean: Did you hate being a slave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cozzie: Thank you for visiting us, goodbye.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
That was an amazing experience, too bad he couldn't speak/write English.
