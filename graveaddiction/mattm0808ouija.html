On August 29, 2008 I received an e-mail from Matt M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friends and I recently bought a ouija board and play it frequently.  Nothing bad ever happened - we would always say prayers and take all necessary precautions.  Until one day...
<br><br>
We played with the board in our living room for the first time, and we came across an evil spirit who claimed to be called &quot;narax,&quot; which I'm guessing is a type of demon due to his age, and because he kept saying the numbers 616 and 916.  He went by a nickname, &quot;zay.&quot; We came across him once before, but he was nice and friendly.  Once we started playing, it started writing the same three initials that had no meaning.  Then when we asked if we could leave, and it said no really fast.  Then we asked what we could do in order to leave, and it said &quot;kill.&quot;  We immediately stopped playing.
<br><br>
The next day we played in another room and talked to someone who claimed to be someone else.  It was really Zay again.  We asked him why he kept coming back, and he said he was stuck in purgatory and for him to pass Krylste (one of the players) has to die.  We stopped playing.  Now every time we play, he will always come and we aren't allowed to talk to anyone else.  He would pretend to be someone's relative and would gain our trust.  Then we figure out it's him.  We will talk with him for awhile, until he starts talking about death and killing.  Then we will leave.  We tried playing with a cross and a Bible, and we asked why it had no effect.  He said, &quot;bcuz I'm too evil.&quot;  I'm writing to you because we need some advice on how to release him from the board so we can talk to other spirits.  He usually scares us, and it bothers us all day long. What can we do??  We will really appreciate the help.

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Matt, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to him.
