On July 8, 2008 I received an e-mail from May about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

After mine and George's last experience with the Ouija board, we swore we would never try it again. We were wrong. We first played the ouija when were were ten (I know, young age). We decided to try it again when were both twelve. Here is the full conversation (I wrote it down for this exact reason).
<br><br>
May: Are you ready to answer some questions?<br>
Ouija: YES<br>
<br>
George: What's your name?<br>
Ouija: Tabula<br>
<br>
May: Oh? When were you born?<br>
Ouija: Tabula<br>
<br>
George: We get it.<br>
Ouija: Tabula<br>
<br>
-End of session-
<br><br>
We didn't get why it kept saying Tabula.  We looked it up on Google, and it came up as another Ouija board.  George and I were still a little afraid of the ouija board, so we decided to get my big sister, Krista, Kara, Reanne, and Adam to come over and play with us so we didnt feel alone.
<br><br>
George: Hello, are you ready to answer some questions?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Krista: OK, what is your name?<br>
Board: Matt Janzen<br>
<br>
Me: Janzen? That's my last name.<br>
Board: I know<br>
<br>
Kara: Are you lying?<br>
Board: No no<br>
<br>
Reanne and Adam weren't playing at the time because there were already three people playing.<br>
<br>
George: Are you realated to May and Krista?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Krista: How?<br>
Board: Brother<br>
<br>
May: We never had a brother.<br>
Ouija: Yes yes you did<br>
<br>
George: I have known them all my life, it was only those two.<br>
Ouija: Assk ur mom<br>
<br>
May: Why?<br>
<br>
After that it stopped answering. We said goodbye, and it replied goodbye.  It didn't spell very well, but we translated it.
<br><br>
I told my mom about the board and what it said.  She said yes, it was true. She then explained that she was pregnant before me. And that she miscarried during her 8th month. It was a boy, and she was planning on naming him MATTHEW. We were like, whoa...how does a baby who was never born talk? We wanted to ask it more questions.  So we invited everyone over and got the board out.
<br><br>
Us:  Is Matt Janzen there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
May: How old are you?<br>
Board: 14<br>
<br>
George: Who taught you to talk?<br>
Board: Gawd (God, in translation)<br>
<br>
Krista: I thought you weren't allowed to use a board if you're an angel?<br>
Board: Gawd let me talk to you to tell you something<br>
<br>
May: And what is that?<br>
Board: I love you and will see you in a while<br>
<br>
Krista: Who?<br>
Board: Mom<br>
<br>
George: When?<br>
Board: 96<br>
<br>
May: When mom is 96?<br>
Board: Yess<br>
<br>
Krista: You know, you're breaking all the laws of the Ouija board.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
George: By the way, 60 years is not a while.<br>
Board: Yess<br>
<br>
Krista: What do you look like?<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
May: Wait!<br>
<br>
The board stopped answering, and we said goodbye.  It said goodbye back. We haven't played the ouija since. We're planning a session for August 1, during the eclipse. We were really creeped. I was hoping that it was really him, and not a liar. I met a brother I never knew.  I was a little depressed that he died.  My mom doesn't really want to talk about it, it made her sad. We asked her who the dad was, but she told us enough with the questions :/  He would have been 2 years older then me, and 1 year younger than my sister. He was supposed to be born March 3rd. Which is ironic because my sister's birthday is in April, and mine is in May. But that was my last Ouija session.
