On July 19, 2006 I received an e-mail from Ryan Keller about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was born October 28th, 1977. Now 28 going on 29 years old, you would think that a grown man wouldn't get scared over a ouija board--but I can't be in the same room with one.
<br><br>
It was October 30th, just 2 days after my 13th birthday. My parents planned a suprise birthday party for me. It was great: a large fire outside, kids from my class, friends that my brothers invited over, family...the works...plenty of food and fun.....
<br><br>
I had an aunt stop by the house late that night. She brought over my older cousins...2 girls about 20-21 years old at the time--and with them one of their boyfriends. I never knew this about my aunt, but she told me that she was really into hauntings and such. In the past, she had even gone to cemeteries and left voice recorders over night to see if she could pick up the voices of spirits (at 13 you can imagine how freaked I was by this).  Then from behind her back she brought out an ouija board and explained to me what it was. Ok, so why is this thing in my house? Why did she bring it here?
<br><br>
She told me that I had just had a big step forward in life, becoming a teenager. She told me that with the high presence of good fortune, good intentions, and being &quot;Halloween&quot;....that this would be an excellent time to try to see if we could talk to a spirit.  Say what????
<br><br>
We began. About 6 of us gathered around. I think I remember candles being lit, but that's about it. Before long, we were talking to a spirit that my aunt had invited into a conversation. It was that of a young boy, around the age of 10 or so. I don't recall his name, but he was polite, wished me a Happy Birthday, and talked just like a normal 10 year old would.
<br><br>
The conversation was mostly chit-chat, but then my aunt wanted to know more about the boy. She asked him how he had &quot;crossed over&quot; into the spirits' world. The boy said that he wasn't totally sure, but he thought that he had been killed in a house fire. He didn't specify that it was our house, nor did he mention the year he had been killed. However, our house at that time was an old farm style home--and my parents were talking about adding an upstairs to the house to make more room for the family. With that said, let me continue.
<br><br>
Things were ok, until my older brother wanted to participate. He, at the time, was 16. He didn't believe anything that was going on, and it made the boy angry. My aunt asked the boy what was wrong and the board spelled out my brother's name. Of course I figured it was my aunt pulling a trick on him. My brother naturally acted like an ass and said something mean to the young boy. The board jumped from their grasps, and everyone yelled.
<br><br>
My brother got up and just walked away. He said it was all bullshit, and started heading toward his bedroom--you had to walk through my parents' room to get to his.  He went to turn on his light, and the lightbulb shattered!!!  It didn't just burn out, IT SHATTERED!!!
<br><br>
You could hear the light go into what seemed like a thousand pieces. My brother ran into my parent's room, and tried to turn on another light. That lightbulb SHATTERED also....pieces of glass all over both floors...
<br><br>
My aunt looked at me and said, &quot;Ryan, get on the board with me. He likes you, you're about the same age as him. We have to get him back and talk to him.&quot;  My older brother at this time---16  years old-----now crying, horrfied...
<br><br>
We were able to get the young boy back on, but then the board got all crazy.....figure eights and such----but in a mad way...with fight, anger---you could feel it.....then it just stopped....
<br><br>
It tried to also spell DEVIL, but my aunt stopped it. She blessed the board and everyone around. We tried again, and got the boy again. He apologized and then spelled out &quot;beleeve me now&quot;...
<br><br>
YOU BET YOUR ASS I DO!!!
<br><br>
My mom wanted to talk to the boy, and he said that he would be happy to talk to her. Mom just asked him silly questions. You could almost sense a feeling of joy and laughter in the air. She asked him if she would get a check in the mail and he said, &quot;for you, yes.&quot; And she asked if she would ever get new kitchen cabinets--he said, &quot;for you, yes.&quot; My mom was content and decided that she didn't want to talk any more, but she felt like she just couldn't get up and walk away....
<br><br>
It was like the boy was wanting her to stay.....to never leave him. I guess because of the motherly vibe she was giving off.  The board became angry again, and my aunt had to put an end to it all. She did the blessings, and ended the sessions...total time of about 15-20 minutes.
<br><br>
That night my aunt gave me the board, told me to never burn it, and always treat it with respect and so on.  By 1:00 am I'm wide awake and the board is underneath my bed. Im freaking out. I ran to my parents, and dad told me to just put it out in our garage, which was separate from the house. I did that, went back inside....but still felt very strange. I wasn't happy, I didn't like that thing near me. I called my aunt, woke her up, and told her how I felt. She got one of her daughter's boyfriends to come and get it at 2:00 AM or so....poor guy.
<br><br>
The next day...I woke up...refreshed, but still uncertain of what went on that night. Then I heard my mom come into the house from going to the mailbox outside. She was the most pale color I had ever seen. I asked her what was wrong and she said nothing. She just looked at me-dropped the mail on the kitchen table...and left the room. I looked at the mail, and one envelope that she opened had a rebate check in it......
<br><br>
One week later, my dad came home from work with  kitchen cabinets he had bought off of someone he knew.  They weren't store new, but they were new to mom....and new to the house.
<br><br>
About 2 years later we were adding an addition to the house like I mentioned earlier. This was an ongoing struggle that lasted for about 9 months, but in the process we found an old deed to a house that use to sit on our property. The deed was within the walls when we trying to remodel. It was burnt around the edegs like it had been in a fire.....and the date was from 1921.....
<br><br>
Mom and I just stared at each other...we never spoke about it- not then, and not ever since.
