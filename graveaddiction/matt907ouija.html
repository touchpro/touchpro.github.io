On September 19, 2007 I received an e-mail from Matt R. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
About 11 years ago, when I was in high school; my friends and I used to schedule some time of our own in the gym rooms during our breaks to play some soccer or any other kind of game. One day however, we decided to make a ouija board to see what would happen. We made it out of paper and used a small glass cup to &quot;hover&quot; over the board. At first it didn't work at all - we all (there were 7 of us) touched the glass and nothing happened. After a while we decided that Kim and I would be the ones to participate and the others would watch us.
<br><br>
This is where it started working. We asked if someone willing to talk to us was there, and the board responded with yes. His name was Jean Paul. We pretty much asked some basic questions, but after a while Kim told me to release the glass immediately. Her face was shocked and pale, so I released it, as did she. At that very moment the entire gym room started to smell like something that would be best described as burning plastic. Kim told me she saw a man standing behind me that was holding a knife. The others that were watching us said they saw a form of energy, pretty much in the form of a carpet floating above the two of us while we were touching the glass. We were all spooked and tore up the board that we made. We left the gym room, but the door refused to close. Every time we tried to close the door a gust of wind with that burned plastic smell prevented us from doing so. We decided to call some teachers to try and close the door, but even they didn't manage to do so.  We were forced to fess up to what we had done. It turns out that local newspapers reported about this incident later on.
<br><br>
Anyhow, during the class after this I saw a man standing outside through the windows. He didn't do anything aside from standing there for the full 45 minutes that the class lasted. Kim saw him too, as did three out of the five others who were watching us at the time.
<br><br>
After that day I've had several encounters that were not pleasant at all. Prior to this I knew nothing about the ouija, and I've only learned later on that you're supposed to close a session, which we never did because of our abrupt ending.
<br><br>
Often, when I'm sleeping with the lights off, I feel that someone touches me: a hand on my shoulder, a poke in my stomach. When I walk across a mirror in the dark I can see something standing next to me. Each time this happens, that smell of burning plastic returns. Sometimes I feel peaceful when I feel/see this presence, but more often it sends shivers down my spine.
<br><br>
It's been 11 years, I'm 24 now and still clueless. I've lost contact with all the others that were there at the time and there's no way that I'd be able to track them, but I'd like to end this. I'd just like to feel safe again in front of mirrors or attempting to sleep, but how? I don't really have the courage to take up the ouija board again and close this session; I'd rather just forget about this, yet the memory never faded.
<br><br>
What do you think I should do?  An answer would be greatly appreciated.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Matt, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward your advice on to him.
