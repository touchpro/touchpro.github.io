On April 11, 2009 I received an e-mail from Dana about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Dana. Me and my friends (Cassy, Faran, and Ashley) were using my ouija board in my basement. Some of the boys where I live were watching (Lealand, Chris, and Tristain)...they were not touching the ouija board at all, so they are not included when it says &quot;everyone.&quot; I don't know if some one was moving the planchette, and I don't remember everything that happened.
<br><br>
Me: Is there any one here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cassy: What is your name?<br>
Board: It<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name it?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Faran: Are those your initials?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell us your full name?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Faran: Are you not allowed to tell us your full name?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you a girl?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you good?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 16<br>
<br>
Ashley: That's pretty young.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cassy: What year did you die?<br>
Board: *moves in circles*<br>
<br>
Me: What year did you die?<br>
Board: (I don't remember the year she died, sorry)<br>
<br>
I asked someone to ask a question.<br>
<br>
Cassy: Do you know anyone in this room?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Now we were gettig a little creeped out.<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Faran: Do you know me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Faran: How do you know me?<br>
Board: Hospital<br>
<br>
I don't remember the full conversation about &quot;it&quot; knowing Faran, but what I do remember is that &quot;it&quot; died while Faran was being born, and &quot;it&quot; saw her as a baby before she died. Now we were completely freaked out.
<br><br>
Cassy: How did you die?<br>
Board: Car<br>
<br>
Me: Did you die in a car crash?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: I'm sorry to hear that.<br>
Board: Thank you<br>
<br>
Me: What did your parents do when you died?<br>
Board: Eat<br>
<br>
Faran: Eat what?<br>
Board: Me<br>
<br>
That really freaked us out.<br>
<br>
Cassy: Do you like us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Everyone: We like you too.<br>
Board: *circles*<br>
<br>
Cassy: Do you think I'm hot?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Cassy: Yay!<br>
Board: lol<br>
<br>
Me: What do you think of me?<br>
Board: Nice<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you, I think you're nice too.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
The boys who were watching were laughing like idiots.<br>
<br>
Ashley: Do you know Lealand?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Ashley: Is he a retard?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We all started laughing (Lealand is not really a retard).<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have any questions for us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Ask away!<br>
Board: What do you taste like<br>
<br>
I'm not lying, &quot;it&quot; actually said that. Now we were scared out of our minds.<br>
<br>
Everyone: Bad. You don't want to taste us.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can we stop talking now?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Faran: Please?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Will you hurt us if we leave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Everyone was so scared that we were shaking, and I almost started crying.<br>
<br>
Everyone: Please, can we leave?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Everyone: Thank you.<br>
Board: Friends<br>
<br>
Everyone: Umm...(not really meaning it, and very reluctantly) Yes, we can be friends. Bye.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
We turned the board and planchette over, and ran out of my basement and outside. That was in July 2008.  I have never used my oujia board since.
