<br><br><br>
Grave Addiction was mentioned in an article about Wolfe Cemetery in the September 2005 issue of <i>Ohio Magazine</i>.  Although the author of the article didn't say any positive things about the site, it was a GREAT article about family cemeteries.  So how was the site portrayed unfavorably?  The author and his relatives feel that the &quot;lunatics&quot; who read about the supposed haunting at the cemetery on my site are responsible for a lot of the vandalism that has happened there.  Nevermind that the legend has been around longer than the Internet, and that it's mentioned on several other sites.<br><br>A big thank you to all the visitors who have written to say they appreciate the site for helping preserve history...that's its main purpose, and hopefully none of you vandalize any cemeteries you visit.  I personally don't think you're lunatics :)
