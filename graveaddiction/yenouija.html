On December 2, 2006 I received an e-mail from Yen about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Yen, and I'm from Australia. I have read the stories on this site and my experience is just for laughs.
<br><br>
It was Wednesday, the 29th of November. That night we wanted to play the Ouija Board. We were also at camp!! I think we thought of it as a game, and didn't really take it seriously. I knew that inside we were really shitting ourselves, LOL. Weirdly, a storm was brewing and we thought it was a good night to play. Tran, Thanh, Crystal, Tina, and myself went into our cabin and started reading the book. Tina (Owner of board) felt something bad was going to happen that night so she left. The rest of us continued to read the book, and we also decided that we should play the day after because we were starting to take it more seriously. So we read the guide book as a group to have a better understanding of the Ouija process.
<br><br>
As the rest of our cabin girls came back, a blackout occurred and we all started screaming at the top of our lungs!!! We quickly ran out of the room, into the hallway. Looking back into the cabin was so scary because it seemed cold and it was pitch black. The whole campsite was blacked out, and we were forced back into the dark cabin to sleep...which we couldn't!!! I think the girls in the other cabins were fast asleep whilst our cabin was wide awake by the rumbling of the storm and the whaling of the winds, which sounded like angry ghosts!! It was so aggressive that two of my friends began to cry....one of them said that when she closed the window, she saw a white figure, which added to the anxiety of everyone! The other girl swore she saw a figure in the mirror in our room. I felt really bad because I thought the Ouija was to blame for the mysterious weird events, so I suggested that we pray to God.
<br><br>
Teachers kept on checking on us and didn't understand why some of us were crying. They didn't know the whole story, and that it wasn't just the storm to blame!! Something was there outside our window or in our cabin...not sure, but whatever it was it scared all of us to death and i won't play the Ouija ever again! It's funny because the next night we were sound asleep.
