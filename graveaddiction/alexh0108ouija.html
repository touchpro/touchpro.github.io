On January 5, 2008 I received an e-mail from Alex H. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This was the first time I used a Ouija Board. We used it several times that night. These are all of the conversations I can remember us having with the spirits. It was very early morning on January 1st, 2008. It was probably around 3 AM. We were in an old church. We were in the basement, next to the staircase. There are many conversations here.
<br><br>
<b>Conversation #1</b>
<br>
Alex, Sarah G., Markeesha, Brianna, Blaine, Makayla, Sarah S., Dean (my dad)
<br><br>
Sarah S: Is anyone here?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Brianna: Are you a boy or a girl?<br>
Board: Animal<br>
<br>
Brianna: You're an animal?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Alex: What kind of animal?<br>
Board. Rhino.<br>
<br>
Alex: You're a rhino?<br>
