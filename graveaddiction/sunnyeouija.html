On July 27, 2006 I received an e-mail from Sunny Eckerle about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Matt was telling me his friend got an ouija board, so out of curiosity I bought one too. He and I played with it all afternoon, but nothing really that amazing happened until later...
<br><br>
After he had gone home, my friend Meganne and my boyfriend Mitchell came over to play. Again, nothing too amazing happened until a girl came on.  She said her name was Naomi, a girl who recntly died in a car accident near where we live. She spelled out MITCH. And then, very slowly, said &quot;Be careful of band.&quot; He and his friends have a band, but their singer recently quit. Then Naomi spelled out MARK, and then SING. And then she was gone. He said he actually knew a guy named Mark who played guitar, but he didn't know that he sang. Apparently they may get in touch soon.
<br><br>
My friend, Meganne, stayed over last night at my house because we were so creeped out. So this morning we decided to play real quick before I had to leave for work. At first, nothing much happened. Then it spelled out WORK. We asked what about work and it said CALL. I thought Meganne was messing with me, trying to get me to call in sick so we could hang out. But then it spelled RAPE. By now I was really freaked out and thoroughly late for work. We asked when and it kept sliding between the 2 and the 7. We asked if it meant 2:07, but it slid to NO and then went back to the 2 and the 7 more insistantly this time. Meganne suddenly realized that today is July 27th. So, we asked who, even though I didn't know if I
really wanted to know. It spelled out NAUTIA PRIN and trailed off. I asked if it meant &quot;nautical princess&quot; because that is my nicknmae that my boyfriend calls me, but the board said NO. And then it spelled out a name of a girl I work with, very close to Nautia. I asked what I could do and it said NOW A LIE. I asked if I was to lie to her and it said YES. Then it went to 3:50 and then NAP. We asked if nap meant break and it said yes. We asked if there was anything else and it spelled out VAN. And then it left. I'm at work now and its 1:20. So we'll see what happens. And I'm definately going to suggest a break at 3:50.
<br><br>
It's very creepy, but I believe it.
