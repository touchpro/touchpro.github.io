On October 10, 2007 I received an e-mail from Abbey Buchalter about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
One night my friends Sydney, Whitley, and Yolanda were having a slumber party at my house.  My friend Sydney brought over a ouija board, so we wanted to try it at 12:00 at night.  We went into my bedroom, and my brother brought candles.  We lit two candles and then sat on the bed.  We all had pillows in case we got scared.  We first asked it if I would ever get a boyfriend.  It didn't answer, but then we asked if Sydney would ever go out with the guy she has a crush on and it started to move.  We thought someone was moving it for a joke, but no one was.  It moved and said yes.  Then we asked if it knew who I liked, and it started to move towards the A, which is the first letter in the guy's name.  We were so excited, but super scared.  Then it moved towards the goodbye signal.  All of a sudden we looked at my mirror and saw glowing fugures around my room, so we turned on the lights and they were gone.  So we went and played wii to calm us down. A couple weeks later, the figures started coming more.  But then Sydney called me and told me that she asked the spirits more questions, then told them to leave forever and they did.  I haven't seen them since.  It seems like Sydney was protecting me the whole time from harm!  TRUE STORY!
