On January 9, 2006 I received an e-mail from Catherine about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
It all started at my birthday party, when a friend, Lauren, and I saw a ghost in my hallway. We can still remember exactly what it looked like. I ended up moving to a new house, and during the holidays she came down to stay with another couple of friends.
<br><br>
After hearing stories about Lauren being woken up every night at 11:11 PM,  and other strange things, we decided to use an ouija board. When we used it, a ghost named JJ came up. Lauren knew this spirit, and as we started talking we discovered it was the one I had seen at my party.
<br><br>
The thing is, he kept saying that Lauren's dad was a murderer. This seemed strange considering every time Lauren brought up why they moved when she was one year old, Lauren's dad would change the subject. We asked many other spirits, and they still told us that JJ was good.
<br><br>
All of a sudden I felt a hand on mine. Then after letting my other friend take over the board, I laid down...only to feel someone laying on top of me! And just at that very moment, Lauren's cell phone rang. It was her dad, and he seemed very worried.  He constantly asked &quot;What are you doing? Where are you?&quot; JJ told us her dad has the ability to talk to ghosts.
<br><br>
He still visits me, and Lauren's dad will not talk about it. There are many things he said that only I know, and things that only Lauren knows. The other thing is that Lauren's dad's best friend, Craig, died of cancer earlier that year...and Craig tells us not to talk to JJ.  But then again, when we tried to ask Craig about the murder, he would avoid the question and say &quot;go away.&quot;
<br><br>
From this day on, I still get haunted by him.  Lauren and I both believe we have the ability together to feel things...weird!!
