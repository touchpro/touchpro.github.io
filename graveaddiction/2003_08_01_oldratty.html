		<div class="content">Hello out there world!<br /><br />Tis good to be called "mommy's cute little girl" and "mommy's little baby".  I have really enjoyed this week.  Mommy will probably need to wear wrist braces from petting me so much to make up for leaving me last week, the heifer.  However, I think the good times are coming to an end and I have pushed the extra affection button as much I as I can.  I was cramming myself into the "box" she brought me from vacation when she shouted, YES SHOUTED, at me, the Princess, that my "FAT ASS" was crushing the box.  My ass is not fat, I am just a well padded kitty which makes me softer and more cuddly, and the box is breaking because she was stupid and got a too small box.  If she would have gotten the "princess" size box it would have been fine.  Hateful witch, trying to make me feel guilty for indulging in a few extra "guilt Pounces" while she was out globe-trotting.<br />I cannot be too hard on mommy this week, she has had a tough week.  Once again, it amazes me how many people in this world can walk around with their head up their ass.  First of all that has just got to be uncomfortable not to mention smelling bad, and then how can anyone that has their head up their ass make competent decisions?  Mommy must work in for a circus since it seems many of the heirarchy there seem to be clowns or contortionists that are always putting their heads up their asses.  Mommy's mommy must work for a circus too, she has a lot of the same complaints.  I will just never understand the human world.  Mommy keeps telling me not to worry, duh.....I know I will always be fed and cared for,  I am the most important creature in the world.  Still, something bad must have happened.  Wish I knew who upset mommy, I would fart in their face and Iams cat food for adult, full figured kitties makes for some really potent farts!  By the way, what is a voodoo doll and why does mommy's mommy keep saying she needs to get some  :- )<br />Ahhhh, cannot forget to mention the evil trio.  The "boys" have been having a good time this week, running up to the barn, playing with the lesser "outside cats", and running in the park next door.  They were so excited, they mowed the field at the park and there were so many new smells that I thought the assholes were going to go into convulsions tying to "snoovel" everything.  By the way, weiner dogs have snoovels, other dogs have snouts with a nose but weiner dogs have snoovels and they snoovel.  So snoovel is both a noun and a verb, just depends on how you use it.  I never saw so much snooveling as I did last night.  Of course mommy's daddy thought that was soooo cute.  He is brain dead.  His life is those dogs.  Example, if I happen to poop on the floor (okay you and I know it is revenge but my people don't) he yells at me and calls me "damned cat" and he accuses me of purposely doing it.  Now if one of the boys shit on the floor, it is just an accident and is probably daddy's fault because he should have been watching them/or they tried to tell me/or they didn't mean it....yeah right, like the time Max the Mangler ate mommy's mommy's curtain.  That night will live in infamy but will relate the whole story another time.<br />Mommy's mommy is boarding the dogs next week because everyone but mommy is going on vacation.  Hmmmm, I am not sure but I think that means I will have mommy and the house to myself.  Oh the places I can go, the things I can do, without any interference.  Life is good.  Hmmmm, the boys have never spent a night away from home...this could be interesting.  Well, keep you updated.<br /><br />Bye for now, Ratty the Ruler of the World!</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello out there loyal and devoted fans.  The world is good, the birds are singing, my mommy is home at long last.<br /><br />About damned time, the little run-around tramp.  It was a long hard week without her.  Mommy's mommy is just not as understanding and generous as mommy, nor does she put up with my temper tantrums and my stomping around the house.  Mommy's mommy will smack my butt or tell me to shut the hell up before she beats me.  She is an evil,vile person but with mommy gone she was the best available.  Sure, Beth the Brutal would visit and stuff me full of POUNCE, my all time favorite cat treat but then that bitch would pick me up and pet me, messing my fur and treating me like...well, like a cat.  I am a princess, I am the princess, Ruler of MY World and Beth the Brutal treats me like a cat.  Of course Mommy's daddy totally ignores me since he has the butt-sniffing mutuants and he only acknowledges me if he steps on me when I am under his feet (hoping to trip him so he notices me instead of those other creatures) or when the deformed creatures aka dachshunds chase me.  So sad to say, I missed mommy.<br />Mommy brought presents for everyone, she visited two friends' homes, Jack Daniels and Jim Beam and they provided her with unique gifts for the family.  Mommy's mommy is especially impressed with bourbon scented candle...does smell good, wonder what bourbon is?  Mommy even gave me a box of my very own, mommy's mommy says it is a good things I don't understand the box was a freebie...whatever in the hell a freebie is.  Doesn't matter, I love my box, I cram my butt in (and no matter what Beth the Brutal says I am not a fat ass!) and I am hidden from the world, I just know that is true.  I probably should warn mommy I took a nice healthy dump on the floor by my litter box because she left me but heck, she will find it tonight since it is the night to clean the litter box.  I feel a little bad, not very bad, that I did that, after all mommy did bring me a box.<br />Mommy lost her mind while she was on vacation.  She came home Saturday and caught me and told me I am her pretty baby (of course I am) and she was happy to see me (of course she would be) and then the idiot carries me outside...like hello there dumbass what are you thinking?!?!?  Get real, it is hot outside, there are nasty biting bugs and dragging me clear up to the barn which is unknown territory is frightening!!!  I immediately got away and ran back to the house.  Well really, mommy did not carry me up, her friend Mike carried me but I am sure she was the one that thought of it...Mike is just too nice.<br />Mommy is home, I can go back to being my normal self.  I was glad she came home, I hate sleeping alone in bed, so much more fun to make her sleep in positions like a pretzel.<br />Today things are back to normal, I will do my very best to get back to being my normal, ruling self.  Being me is great!!!!</div><br>

		<div class="content">It happened, that two timing bitch left me.  She left me and went on vacation!  Oh sure, she is away, having a great time in hot tubs and going places and eating out, I am left here alone.  I was so distraught that I actually moped on the bed all day.  Even when mommy's mommy brought Little Fluff (what kind of a name is that!?) in to visit and she got all uppity and hissed at me on MY BED, I just laid there.  I am depressed, I feel discarded, I feel like I just do not matter anymore.  She is a hateful mommy, I bet she doesn't even bring me a present!<br />Saturday night I went out to find food....sure, all that was in my bowl was dry diet cat food (I eat 2X as much, what makes them think I want to be anything more than a full-figured lady) not a POUNCE in site.  I yowled at mommy's mommy and she told me to SHUT UP, can you believe that, told me to SHUT UP.  That cow, she ought to think for a minute about who it is she said that to, she will pay.  I am not sure when or how but she will pay.  I survived until Sunday.  Finally she gave in and gave me POUNCE so I feel at little less vengeful.<br />I have been really doing a good job of looking like "miserable kitty waif" because even mommy's daddy yelled at "his boys", those creatures made of leftover road kill parts that call themselves dogs, those creatures whom he adores, to stop chasing "The Cat" (that's me).  Usually he just laughs but I think even he feels bad that I was left behind.  Granted his reasoning may be somewhat different (he thinks if mommy wants me she should take me everywhere so I do not get "his boys" in trouble" heeheheeeee) but still the fact that he took my side makes me feel pretty darned good.  Ahhhh, if I heard correctly I have a whole week to milk this abandonment for all it is worth.  Wonder how many POUNCE I can mooch.  I can only pray that Beth the Brutal aka Beth the Softie, visits.  She will probably give me a whole can of POUNCE!!!<br />more to come, stay tuned, The Ratty</div><br>

		<div class="content">Mommy read my blog.  She was hurt, she says I never say good things about her.  What a crybaby.  But, honestly, she is a pretty darn good mommy.  She does make sure (at least some of the time) that I have food and water and sometimes she even washes the dog spit out of my bowls (if those food scarfing mongrels would stay out of my food my bowl would not get dog spit in it!).  She tries to keep the litter box clean (except when she is too busy with her life) but I must admit, I am quite the little shitter and it is a full time job for her.  She doesn't even complain when she has to clean up my turdlings left all over the basement (my revenge for dirty litter box).  She does get mad when cleaning the litter box and when it is totally empty I run over and take a piss in it....she hates dumping cat piss and washing out the litter box...I love doing that to her, speeds her up.  Besides, a little amonia smell opens up her sinuses.  She knows her place, curled around me on the bed since it is my bed and I permit her to sleep there.  She never complains about cat hair all through her bed and she is nice and lets me under the blankies when I am cold.  She does give me kisses and lets me kiss her and she even lets me flirt with her friend Mike (he really likes me more than her but I let her think he likes her most) so all in all she is a pretty good mommy.  EXCEPT, it has been confirmed, she is leaving me for a week long vacation!!!!  No one to cuddle with, no one to call me pretty kitty or baby girl, no one to give me kisses for a whole week!!!  So I will lay on our bed and shed, I will rumple the blankets, I will stomp over the house, torment the dogs and yowl loudly the whole time she is gone and yes, turdlings in the basement, just for spite!  Before she leaves I will be sure to sit on her luggage and give her sad eyes and mope around, she deserves extra guilt for leaving me stranded for a week.  Hopefully mommy's mommy will have sympathy and clean my bowls and see that I have food and water.  She might even pet me.  The mutts will chase me and bark at me more because mommy will not be there to scream at them like she is possessed and scare them into submission.  Mommy is a pretty wild woman when it comes to yelling at people and mutts.  She could scare Satan himself.  I will miss her but I do not want her to know that.  Then she will think she is more than she is.<br />Well, not much else to say now.  I am sure with the weekend approaching I will have a few adventures.  Come back for the exciting details...maybe Monday.<br /><br />later, the Rattster</div><br>

		<div class="content">Mommy's mommy came home last night and said something that really shocked me.  You must understand, I have always been quite proud of myself, since people will not give me soap and wash cloths, I find it necessary to clean my nether regions with my tongue.  I have heard of people supposedly having ribs removed to get to get to certain body parts with their mouths (sickos and perverts only) but those are few and far between which is why I was so shocked when I heard mommy's mommy say that lots of people where she works have their heads up there butts!  I can lick my butt but even as limber and supple as I am I cannot get my head up there!!!  Someday I hope to see those people, they must be double-jointed or deformed.<br />I have been naughty, heheeee.  Mommy has been okay with the litter box duties but the other day I just felt like digging a big hole.  I dug and dug and threw litter and before you know it I had a pile of dried turds and litter outside the crapper...kinda resembles the Great Pyramid.  Mommy will have to clean that.  Mommy is going on vacation for a whole week, abandoning me, leaving me alone to fight battles with the dreaded stunted troll dogs, therefore she deserved a pyramid.  I have scattered litter and turds before around the box but this is my first pyramid.<br />With Mommy gone for a week I will have to yowl more than usual.  Mommy's mommy is very skilled at ignoring me so I will have to be especially irritating.  I may even consider waking her in the middle of the night with a request for POUNCE.  Once awakened it is difficult for her to go back to sleep and she swears better than most sailors when provoked.  Next week should be lots of fun.  Should Beth the Brutal visit I can give her poor neglected kitty looks, she really has a big heart and she will give me POUNCES.  My biggest fear is that my litter box will be neglected and I will have to either dirty my paws stepping on turdlings, manage to encourage the shit-eating dogs to come downstairs and clean my litter box by eating the tootsies I produce (they are so stupid won't be difficult), or just resort to pooping all over the basement.  I will also be sure to shed lots on the bed I let mommy sleep in, that way she will have to change the bedding when she comes home before she can rest her weary head.  I do so hope she brings me a present!!!!  Witch, she could take me with her, I have never been to Tennessee, I have never been much of anywhere, heck a trip to the new barn would be a vacation holiday for me.<br />Well, think I have talked enough.  later, RattyCatt, the supreme.</div><br>

		<div class="content">I had a birthday on August 7th, which was last Thursday.  I am now 9 years old.  Yes, in cat years you dumbasses, after all, I am a cat.  Instead of trying to convert my age to people years try doing it right and convert your ages to cat years.  The world would be a better place if people just accepted the fact that cats are superior.  The world would also be a better place had anyone in the family remembered my birthday!  At the very least I expected a cake and fresh POUNCE but I did not even get a happy birthday from anyone.  Oh sure, finally last night mommy's mommy remembered (while she was in the bathroom, why does all her great thinking take place in the bathroom?) and she told mommy.  Sure mommy felt bad and called me her baby and pretty girl and let me sleep in the middle of the bed under the warm blankets but it is not enough!  I wanted presents and POUNCE, manna from heaven.  I will have to plot revenge or perhaps, better still, will walk around looking like "lost kitty that no one loves" avoiding eye contact and hiding when anyone tries to touch me.  People are so stupid, they think I am really depressed when it is an act put on by me to get more POUNCE.  I am sure mommy is already feeling guilty and will give me lots tonight when she gets home from work.<br />Beth the Brutal just had to bring up that she gave me 10 POUNCE over the weekend.  I am not ungrateful.  She comes once a week, breezes in the house greeting the rodent dogs, holding them and giving them treats then later she sees me (after she is covered in dog slobber and hair) and tries to pick me up and pet me.  She is gross, I should be first.  She owes me those POUNCES for the neglect, for passing me by for the barking fools, for holding them first!!!  Now I am angry, she owes me more POUNCE for her dereliction of duty to me.  COW!!!!<br />Let's talk about mommy.  Of course she did not come home after work last night to care for me...no she goes out with HIM, the boyfriend, Mike.  Whatever, I am the one that keeps her warm at night.  I snuggle and purr in her ear.  I am the one sleeping in the middle of the bed, growling if she tries to move me, permitting her to share the bed with me and allowing her to curl around me in the most uncomfortable sleeping position ever and I do all of this because I love her.  Then she spends her supper and evening with HIM.  I just do not understand the attraction, oh sure, he is a good face scratcher and sure he does hold me the way I like but why does she spend so much time with him.  She is too big for him to hold and she doesn't even like her face scratched.  Hello, the world revolves around me, yes it is all about me, I should come first in everyone's daily life.  Perhaps I will snort and yowl next time HE comes to visit, to put him in his place.  Mommy belongs to me!!!!  HE needs to remember.  I was hungry last night (the stinking,, long-haired, short-legged freaks ate my food!) and she was with him.  She thinks that when she comes home around 9:30 and fills my bowl and gives me a POUNCE or two that she should be forgiven for the neglect...my ass, she needs to get her act together and put me first.  I have to keep my figure and it is hard to be a big and beautiful kitty without lots of food.  By the way, what does weight control mean on the package??<br />Well, duty calls, time to go torment the caged creatures.  Max and Sam cannot be trusted alone...mommy's mommy says that the carpet is not for them to pee on....so they are caged.  I can tiptoe call over the couch, sit right outside their cages and stare, all to drive them crazy over the course of the day.  All too soon the family will return from work so I must torment while there is time....but first a nap.<br /><br />Until next time, Ratty.</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello World!  Life has been pretty boring lately.  I was attacked Saturday night by mommy and her friend Mike.  She held me down and he put liquid in my ears...damned perverts.  I hissed and growled but they molested me anyway.  I should call cat welfare services and report them.  A few ear mites never hurt anyone.  Probably got them from the mutants.<br />Mommy's mommy and daddy have been home a lot lately.  Seems they are getting wired..well, getting the barn wired.  They are all excited because now they have lights up at the new barn....big deal...seems to me with all that excitment my POUNCE have been few and far between.  Hard to pester people for treats when they are always outside.  Of course, as usual, I have been neglected, no one takes me to see the new barn or the lights.  Stuck in the air conditioned house, lounging on soft furniture...life is so unfair...............<br />The best part, the "boys" always get to go up to the barn which means the monstorous creatures are out of my sight and not chasing or barking at me.  They are so stupid, running out the door, barking like mad dogs, running up to the barn just to snoovle around and get dirty.  They think that is wonderful, IDIOTS!!!  Then again, I must remind myself, these dumbasses think my shit is tootsie rolls made just for them to munch on.  Shit-eating dumbasses...why do the people here shower them with affection.  Must be a form of mind control, "Look into my dark brown doggie eyes and I will enslave you.  Clean up after me, brush me, pet me, buy me costly toys and treats....".  I must find a way to break this control, perhaps a claw in the butt of the people will do it....if only I still had claws.<br />The weather is awful, rain, rain and more rain.  The heat and humidity is making my fur shed.  Mommy is so evil sometimes, she actually caught me and brushed me!!!  I hate the brush, it is just the idea that someone can tear my fur out.  I will shed when I want and where I want.  Mommy's mommy has been really pissed lately, seems wherever I sit I leave fur.  She told mommy to do something or she would shave me...try it bitch and all your shoes will be gouged!!!  She better not be thinking about a bath either...I clean myself with my tongue, I do not need to be held in a tub of water and soaped!!!  Mommy's mom can be the cruelest person sometimes.  Hmmmm, think I will go make tootsies all over the basement floor....I do have methods of retaliation.<br />That's all for now.  Perhaps this week will be more exciting...........</div><br>

		<div class="content">Hello, my name is RattyCatt and I am an addict.  It is true and I love my dealer who just happens to be mommy's mommy.  Seems she was out working with the flowers and herbs and she brought me a fix.  I was busy eating POUNCE, heavenly Pounces, but I knew as soon as she brought it in the house.  She was busy so just left it on my favorite stool.  I attacked it and chewed, munched, rolled on it and got stoned.  I am a CATNIP addict and not ashamed.  I have no plans to join a program or enter rehab.  I will use whenever I have a chance.  It makes living with the brain-dead, groveling, stunted ones tolerable.  It makes me feel like a kitten again.  Sometimes I even think I have my claws back.  Ahhhh, catnip, glorious, glorious, herb of enlightenment, herb of joy, glorious glorious catnip.  Pray she feels generous again tonight!<br />Other than that not too much exciting.  Heard that Beth the Brutal is visiting...she must need a free meal.  That means I should get extra POUNCES, she is a sucker for heart-rending, poor kitty, looks.  Of course that also means the stinking dogs will get extra treats as well, like the fat as pig things need anything more.<br />Oh yes, last night was brush the weiner dogs night.  Poor old Psycho Sam, mommy's daddy has to catch him since he thinks brushing and feet trimming is torture and once mommy's daddy has him he turns him over to her, Bearer of the brush and scissors.  Psycho Sam got yelled at a couple times for moving or trying to get away until he just finally surrendered.  I loved it.  Then next was Oscar, roly, poly, moody, dog who would be king, he loves brushed and jumped right up.  However, who knows what crosses his mind, last night he decided to try to get away a couple times, probably just for extra attention, and actually wagged when he got scolded.  I really hate him, he tries to protect the other two when I pick a fight.  One day I will show him, only because he outweighs me does he win.  The supper was ready so the family ate giving Max the Mangler time to forget it was brushing night.  Max came to us older and we think he must have had some really horrible experiences with grooming or something because he always runs and hides.  Whatever, no hiding here, once again the traitor, mommy's daddy catches him and gives him to the torturer weilding the brush.  One there he submits so he really did not get yelled at, dammit!  He deserves it just for being a dog, a lesser creature.  Once all were done they got treats...duh, cat over here who washes herself...where is her POUNCE????  Assholes, I am always being forgotten.  There are never too many POUNCES in an evening.<br />Mommy's mommy and Beth the Brutal are going to something called OZZFEST Sunday.  Mommy's Daddy thinks Mommy's mommy is insane.  He's right but then takes one to know one is what I say.<br />Mommy was sad earlier this week....makes me glad I am spayed and have no interest in the males of my species.  I think they must be a pain to deal with.  <br />Well, gonna go nap before the evening begins.  Until later, Ratty </div><br>
