On October 15, 2009 I received an e-mail from Big Chief about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This story was given to me from another friend of mines sometime ago. This is his ouija story to me in his own words:
<br><br>
My Ouija board story begins not with the Ouija board but after.  Me and my friends had been using the ouija board several times in a span, a little over a week.  We had supposedly talked to a few ghosts and asked questions about our future etc.  Later, we started to realize a few inconsistencies in our ghosts or demons or whatever we were talking to.  We caught it lying to us a few times; for example, I would ask its name and it would say &quot;Dave.&quot;  Then later on in the conversation it would tell me its name was Phil.  When we confronted it, it would admit it was lying and would tell us we were morons. It insulted us all the time, which is what got my girlfriend worried. She told me about a mutual friend that had told her that demons were always trying to trick and lie to humans, which makes me realize now that it was a demon, not a ghost. My girlfriend was very worried about the board and had me throw it out, which I did.  I threw away the board. This is when things actually started happening. It started very small at first. I would come home and my pet cat would be on top of the refrigerator hiding.  It wouldn't leave its spot no matter what.  At night, I felt as if I was being watched. My girlfriend had a hard time sleeping as well, as she would constantly wake me up when we were taking naps together.  She would tell me that she felt something touching her and I would say, &quot;Well, I'm touching you,&quot; and she said &quot;No it wasn't you, it felt like an old woman's hand.&quot;
<br><br>
I started having very restless nights.  I'd dream about my room being completely covered in red, like blood, and I would be drowning in it. One day when I came back from work, I was walking to my room and I realized that the wallpaper in the dining room had been cut, shredded actually.  It looked as if my cat had shredded the wallpaper, but here's the interesting part: frozen droplets of water were coming out from inside the wall. I tasted it, and it was water, it was frozen water.  This was kind of weird to see inside your house in the middle of a blazing summer. A few weeks later, while I was sleeping, I felt something scratch me.  I quickly turned on the lights to find out that nothing was there.  When I went to the bathroom, my entire back had been cut like a million little cuts. Two weeks later, I started hearing things.  My back door would slam even though there was no wind. My floor would creak as if a massive weight was walking on top of it. I would see images in the dark. I would walk to my window and see images in the reflection. I decided to use a ouija board one more time to get some answers.  I asked my friend to bring his over since I had thrown mine away.
<br><br>
We tried to contact the entity in my house, and we achieved a response immediately. It had told us it's name was Nathan at first, then a few hours later I asked it's name again and it told us Danial. I asked it to stop lying to us and tell us it's real name, and it spelled out &quot;legio.&quot;  I looked up the word on the internet later on, and figured out it was probably trying to spell &quot;Legion.&quot;  A few days later, I was walking down the steps to my basement one evening when I felt pushed.  I felt as if a massive invisible force pushed my legs out from under me. As I fell, I prayed to God.  I asked God to listen to me and to help me, the first time I had prayed since I was a boy. I didn't even knew if I believed in God, but I felt like I needed assistance. That instance as I tried to talk to my God I felt better.  I felt like I had control over whatever was in my house.  My house felt better; it felt warmer as I wasn't afraid to walk in the rooms anymore as I was before.  I used to be constantly afraid of what might happen should I leave the room I was in.
<br><br>
Even my girlfriend, who during this entire fiasco refused to come over to my house, felt like she could now.  She felt better in my house as she said it was roomy and airy. When we were messing around rough housing one night, she tackled me into one of the beds in the other room.  After a small tickling fight, we were laughing and laying on the floor when she said in an alarmed voice, &quot;What is this!?&quot;  I looked and she had pulled our original ouija board from it's usual spot under the bed.  I panicked as I had never felt more fear in my life.  I began to swear on everything that is good in life that I threw the board away. She even recalled the joke I had made about it.  Remember what I said about Demons being tricky?  I had told a friend who was a demonologist the entire story and she told me that some demons may become affixed to certain objects, in this case the board. Even though I thought I had thrown it away, I was only tricked into thinking I had done so. Under her advice I was supposed to burn the board which I did.
<br><br>
I know this all sounds like something that happens regularly; &floors creaking, cat clawing the wallpaper, falling down the steps, typical boyfriend laziness, throwing stuff away.  It sounds like normal accidents but it wasn't. It's something you'd have to experience to understand what I'm talking about.
