On May 5, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jake Zink about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
For a few weeks before this experience, I had been reading as much as I could about ouija boards.  I also used online ones and such. I finally got around to making a pathetic excuse for one (cardboard with sticker letters :D), and I had my buddies come over the night I was done with it (Friday night weekend).
<br><br>
Well, we whipped it out at about 11 o'clock at night. I was pretty much the only one who knew how to use it, so I started off anouncing our purpose: to talk to knowledgeable and good-intentioned entities. We circled the board for a few minutes, and just when we were about to quit, it moved to hello. &quot;Are you pushing that?&quot;, we all asked each other. Nope. So we asked for the spirit's name, and the entity said its name was &quot;Havc.&quot;   We thought about it for a second, and came to the conclusion it was pronounced Havoc. We then realized...Its name is havoc! Hmmmm. We asked it if it was ever born on earth, and it responded with a yes. We asked what year, and it said &quot;10077&quot; or something of the like. I'm pretty sure that's what it was. Anyway, after we asked that, the planchette started darting around the board randomly. So we decided our chat with this guy was over.
<br><br>
The next one we talked to was named Amy. Amy was great in the beginning, we talked to her for several hours (by the time we were done talking to her it was 3 in the morning!).  We asked tons of questions about psychic stuff. We asked how it works, but got no certain answers. We asked about the universe, aliens, and so on. Our last question, however, it didn't answer. We asked &quot;Who's going to be George's next girlfriend?&quot;, as we were getting out of a serious mood because of boredom. It then answered, &quot;Want to send messages?&quot;  We asked what it meant, and it said &quot;wicca.&quot; We're not into witchcraft/spiritualism/satanism, so we started getting creeped out and said goodbye. It refused to move to goodbye, so we moved it ourselves and flipped the board over.  Then we talked about the events that took place.
<br><br>
As a last stupid thing before we went to bed, we turned on my Slayer CD pretty loud, and muted my TV when it was on a static channel.  We then started doing something extremely stupid: Drawing pentagrams on the board with the planchette instead of circling it or asking it anything to start. After we did like 5 pentagrams and 3 upside-down crosses, it started pulling towards hello. Instantly, the channels on my TV started cycling. Once it reached channel 40 it shut off (it was on channel 4 to start). We said goodbye and it wrote &quot;hahaha listen.&quot; We were pretty much about ready to shit ourselves, and then my stereo turned up all the way, waking my parents and sister to Slayer's &quot;Raining Blood.&quot; We didn't even say goodbye, we just flipped the board and shoved it under my couch...where it still is.
This happened about a month ago, and to tell you the truth, I'm pretty creeped out. I mean, I'm still reading a ton about Ouija boards and stuff, but I don't understand why I'm so interested in them. My room always has a creepy feeling in it now, but not the rest of my house. I don't know if it's psychological or what, but I don't reccomend doing anything stupid like drawing upside-down crosses and pentagrams and blasting Slayer while using an Ouija board. That's pretty much asking for trouble.
<br><br>
Overall, it was an experience I will never forget. To tell the complete and honest truth, I wish I had never come in contact with the world of talking boards, because now I'm hooked. And I don't like it. I'm even making them and selling them for a couple bucks to my friends now!
