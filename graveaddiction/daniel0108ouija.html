On January 24, 2008 I received an e-mail from Daniel about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Daniel.  I'm 25 and I live in Colorado.
<br><br>
This is a very long story, but you should find it very interesting.  I hope someone reads it since I need some help.
<br><br>
About 3 years ago my stepmother bought a Ouija board.
<br><br>
We played for weeks, and we got addicted to it since we were making contact successfully every day.  We made contact daily with a spirit named &quot;MET.&quot;  According to the board, it was a woman.  She said that she had died somewhere around 1950.
<br><br>
Well, the thing is that she seemed like a good spirit and would always give useful and accurate information.  She never got mad or anything like that, and we could ask her anything we wanted to.
<br><br>
We asked questions about where she was, about God, about the Devil, about Heaven and Hell, and about the dead.
<br><br>
A stupid thing to do, of course.  However we didn't have any knowledge whatsoever at the time.  Now I wouldn't ask those kind of questions.
<br><br>
The thing is that we even had a word.  Like a code.  The reason for that was that she would always tell us that we had to be careful, that there were some malevolent spirits where she was and she wouldn't want them into our conversations or trying to interfere.  So she recommended for us to do that with her.  I started to make suggestions, stupid ones actually, like my dog's name or some girl's name that I liked at the time.  Well, she said that they were too simple and that we should use something different and hard to guess by anyone.  So she said &quot;VULNAX&quot;,  which according to her means &quot;Eternal Friendship.&quot;
<br><br>
So we kept talking to her everyday, until one day.  We were talking, but I noticed some weird attitude from her...like hostility, and she was being very rude.  So I asked if it was really Met. And it said yes, of course.
<br><br>
I said, ok, what's the secret word??  And it said oh it's me, don't doubt me, what do you need that stupid word for?  Well, I was like MET ARE YOU THERE?  Please come back.  And the that's when the freaky stuff actually happened.  It said shut up you fuck.  Getron is here now.  Well, we started talking to it but it was rude and very tricky.  So we started asking questions about our family and it would insult everyone and had negative answers towards anything we asked.  So I got tired of it and asked him to stop.  I asked him why he was so rude, and why he was trying to scare us so much.  It said I have to it's my job.And I said your job?  What do you mean your job?  It said it's my job as a Demon and it laug
