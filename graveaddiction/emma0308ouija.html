On March 12, 2008 I received an e-mail from Emma about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My name is Emma, and very reccently I've had another experience with a Ouija Board. I used to be a skeptic until last year when my friends and I contacted a spirit through a ouija board who warned me about an ex-boyfriend who had been stalking me for about two months. Anyway here's my story:
<br><br>
Just last week was my first ever time being a camp counselor at the local camp, Camp Auburn. This was the very same camp I had gone to as a fifth grader (I'm now a junior in high school). I remebered that at fifth grade camp there had been this ghost story that had been twisted through the years about Oscar, the original caretaker of the camp. At the time I'd been so scared that I hadn't been able to sleep. Though as a junior in high school, I figured that the story was fake...but I was also thinking wouldn't I be the coolest counselor if I brought a ouija board so we could contact Oscar!
<br><br>
Well, I did some research on Oscar and Camp Auburn because I had wanted to move the marker around myself to scare the pants off my kids. During my research I found out that the camp had opened in the 1950's, that Oscar often took a latern out in a canoe to find any canoes that had blown into the marsh by the wind, and that Oscar had drowned, but he had also been shot with an arrow. Further research told me that there had also been a small archery range by the lake. This I found very intriguing.
<br><br>
So finally the first night of camp came and me and my kids (five girls) sat in the middle of the room with the ouija board. I really wanted them to believe what the board said, so I took out some candles and said invocations for protection and sacred space. The first night we used the ouija board I had planned on not moving the marker to make the second night when I would move it seem even creepier. I soon found out that the spirit of Oscar didn't agree with me on that.
<br><br>
A short red-headed girl named Sarah asked the first question, &quot;Is anyone here with us?&quot; We waited only two or three minutes until the marker began moving.
<br><br>
The marker began moving very slowly and seemed to glide across the board until it came to &quot;yes.&q
