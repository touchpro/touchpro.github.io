On October 16, 2008 I received an e-mail from Cody M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

It all started when we took an ouija board to this private school in our neighborhood. There one of our friends asked if we could speak to a really, really, really, really evil spirit. Right away the planchette moved, and pretty quickly. We were talking to it, and it said it was a 12 year old who died on a street near the school when he got hit by a car. But at the we were talking to him, the girl with us was like, &quot;If you are really powerful, show us a sign that you're here.&quot;  Right away, something fell in the school and made a loud clash noise.  No one was around to make that sound.
<br><br>
Then a man who worked at the school came out, and we told him about it, but he was skeptical. So to show him, we asked the spirit what the man's name was, and it told us his name was Rob.  Sure enough, it was. So Rob went to walk back into the building, but the lock wouldn't unlock. So we continued to talk to the spirit, and asked him his name.  It told us that he couldn't say. Then without asking it anything, it said &quot;I am the one who dwells within the devil.&quot; Then it went to 666. After that, we said that we were leaving, and he was like, &quot;No, if you leave I'm going to kill you.&quot;  Then it went to 666 again. So we asked it who it was closest to, and it said me.  He said that he was trying to take me over, and that phones give him power and so do our feelings. But we had to leave, so we told him we were going.  It was like, &quot;No, I'll kill you 666 this is not a joke.&quot;  Then it said, &quot;Take me with you, and go up this street hazard.&quot;
<br><br>
So we were walking up to the park because that's were we had to go, and our friend Burkley was ahead of us.  The board said to come back or Burkley's first, so we made him come back. We asked him why he wanted to go up hazard, and it said you will see.  After we walked by this house, the board went crazy and that's where he used to live. So we were on the street, and all of a sudden this car comes flying by and didn't stop.  It almost hit our friend. Earlier, the board said that how we would die was by a car crash.
<br><br>
At the end of the street, it told us to turn down this street named Dodge. As soon as we found out, my friend screamed and was like, &quot;It's hazards and the dodge cars.&quot; So we were all creeped out. When we got to the park, it told us to let this girl Courtney go home, so she ran home. At the park it told us that it had to hold Cody (me) so that I would live longer. My friend held me on his lap. Then it said that if Burkley leaves then he will die, but if he stays then Michelle will die. It kept saying over and over, &quot;666 and I am the one who dwells with the devil.&quot; Then the board said for Makayla to go play on the jungle gym, so she went.  Then we asked the board why, and it said to die. The board told her she can leave and she left, but started to cry and Michelle's parents asked why.  She told them, so they called Michelle over, and Michelle let the thing go. While she was gone, a couple of the people tried to burn the board...they put perfume all over it to burn faster, but the board wouldn't burn. Then they put the board in the trash can and lit the trash can on fire. It turned into a huge fire, and the fire department had to come.
<br><br>
When the police came, they told our friends Andrew and Burkley that they were not able to come back to that park ever again. Earlier in the day, Michelle said to the board, &quot;If you are all powerful, make something bad happen to Andrew and Burkley.&quot; The thing is, Andrew and Burkley did not light the fire...our friend Eric did. So after that, we all left and went to this other park, Gordon, where it all started. There we find cops and a smashed car, right we were standing. The car was meant to hit us like the board said.
<br><br>
Later that night we walked back up Hazard to go home. In the house where the kid said he lived, we saw a figure in the window and the door started to open. The thing is, no one lives there. So we all run. Then, when my friend was walking is girlfriend home, they were walking down a dark road. They said they heard a loud noise, like chains hitting the ground. The next day we go back to the trash can that we burned the ouija board in, and we find everything in it burnt, but the board and the planchette. The planchette was made out of plastic so it would have at least melted, but it didn't and the board was barely burnt. Since that day a couple of us had some near experiences with car accidents. The worst was the other day when we were at the mall, and we all were crossing the street. We were about to cross, but our friend said we better wait for our other friend. Then right in front of us, a girl gets hit by a car right where we would have been. That car was meant to us if we hadn't waited. Recently, our friend who was a part of this got hit by a car. He just got out of the hospital and is OK, but we're not sure that was coincidental.
<br><br>
We were stupid, but I would just like to know someone else's opinion on this. If you have any advice or comments, please let us know.  I thank you for reading this, and would love to hear back from you.
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Cody, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will pass the comments on to him.
