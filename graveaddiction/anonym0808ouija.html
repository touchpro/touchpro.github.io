On August 16, 2008 I received an e-mail from an anonymous website visitor about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I wish not to disclose my identity. A long time back, while I was doing my university education, we tried out this Ouija thing. We tried it at our hostel along with five or six roommates. To this day everything remains unexplained, though at times I feel it did affect me later.
<br><br>
Sometime after lunch, we all decided to try this out. We didn't have a professional ouija board, so we made one temporarily with all letters, numbers, yes, and no. We left out Goodbye. I had worn a chain around my neck which had a crucifix. I remember my friend asking me to remove it, which I possibly didn't do. We sat around a table, and two of us placed our fingers on the coin. A dog in a nearby house let out a howl. They say animals do so upon seeing something of a supernatural nature. We discussed this, and had a good laugh over it. Slowly spirits started coming in.  We asked a lot of questions, simple ones related to our education, career, marriage, etc. We didn't bother to say goodbye to any of them. After sometime, one of our roommates who claimed not to believe in all this placed her finger on the coin. Nothing moved, and our Ouija experience came to an end.  Years later I came across a newspaper article on this topic. It stated that your belief in this practice, in turn motivated by your mind power, moves the thing and not a spirit. It sounded convincing to me. But there is another reality to it. I am Christian, and an Ouija practice amounts to disobeying the first or second commandment. Hence, this had been a grave sin. During a later part of my life, I had to go through many negative experiences. I got into mild drugs, attempted suicide, a relationship which I knew did not have a future but still unable to get out of it, depression, sleeplessness...practically speaking, death seemed better than life. I wasn't happy anywhere, whether office or home. I literally hated my family. I wanted to run away and escape. At this point I sought spiritual assistance. The priest, during an adoration session, prayed for deliverance from evil powers. I felt as though a power which had been clinging on to me, or rather had me clutched tightly, had finally left me. I felt fresh and light. It felt really good. For those of you who are still addicted or interested in Ouija, I tell you it is high time you turn to God. You are commiting a grave sin. My own curiosity in occult got me into a mess. I sincerely hope this doesn't happen to anybody.
