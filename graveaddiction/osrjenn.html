Jenn Schmidt, a VERY helpful website visitor, sent me the above photos and the following list of observations she made while analyzing my OSR photos:
<br><br>
<center><u>OHIO STATE REFORMATORY 4/16/05 GHOST HUNT</u></center>
<br>
<ul> 
<li>2nd pic down- &quot;Moving orb&quot;: look by far door in back (right of the moving orb). faint orb in doorway<br><br>
<li>3rd pic down- &quot;Outside door&quot;: surely you saw white orb to left of door. Check the barred window to left of pic. Go very bottom right- see tiny yet bright orb? Windows above door. Orb in center of right window (tell me it was not raining this night.)<br><br>
<li>9th pic down- &quot;Stairs in Jesus room.&quot;: First off, I'm noticing an actual person standing in the middle of the room. In front of them (or to the left of them, whichever) 1) an orb is present 2) faint orb near top left of picture & 3) orb on staircase into room<br><br>
<li>11th pic down- &quot;Dusty cabinet&quot;: look at cabinet. Look to its immediate left- small orb. Look at top of pic- bigger orb. Look at small window- small orb at bottom right (or could just be dust?)<br><br>
<li>12 pic down- &quot;Showerroom&quot;: See metal beam (pipe) across center of pic? See something metal coming from center of beam? There is another metal beam/pipe at very top of pic near ceiling. The &quot;something metal&quot; coming from the center pipe is attached to the ceiling pipe. Focus on that area- just below the ceiling pipe could be a faint orb.<br><br>
<li>14th pic down- &quot;Dark hallway.&quot;: faint orb on floor in center of pic<br><br>
<li>3rd pic from end- &quot;Rows of cell.&quot;: 2nd window from left (or just beyond 1st cell door.) Look above window OR follow brown piping above bars. See faint orb?<br>
</ul>
<br> 
<center><u>Miscellanous Photos</u></center>
<br>
<ul> 
<li>3rd pic down- &quot;Roped off tower stairs&quot;: orb sighting on stairs. 1st I ask why were the stairs roped off? I ask this because there is a visitor on those stairs. Stair at top of pic- white orb. What else could it be?<br><br>
<li>4th pic down- &quot;Stairs to tower&quot;: Between 2nd & 3rd stair above the head. I see something small & white. Though it may be a flash, what would be reflective? Why that stair & none of the others?<br><br>
<li>5th pic down- &quot;Guard station&quot;: orb sighting above top left corner of white station<br><br>
<li>12th pic down- &quot;Wires hanging from ceiling&quot;: 'Orbs all over the fucking room' was my 1st response. How can you miss them? (If you can, let me know. I'll give a hint: top center & right.) Tell me- is the big red orb from the film?<br><br>
<li>14th pic down- &quot;Shower room&quot;: Full of orbs! Or dust, but they're too sporadic light & dark to be dust. Plus, centered in one area in the shower room- centered and slight left.<br><br>
<li>17th pic down- &quot;Closed door at end of hall&quot;: Orb on panel above door- centered & orb on pipe, neat bottom right of trashcan.<br><br>
<li>20th pic down- &quot;Urinals&quot;: bright orb in center of pic, right below brown spot where paint is peeling (left of left urinal)<br><br>
<li>23rd pic down &quot;Circuit box&quot;: orbs located in circuit box & on white wall to right of circuit box (was someone electrocuted or wanted to electrocute someone?) If you doubt the orbs in this pic, why are they nowhere else in the pic but around that box?<br>
</ul>
<br> 
<center><u>Jesus Room Photos</u></center>
<br><br>
All photos of Jesus room had orbs in them, w/exception of &quot;Old paper on wall&quot;, &quot;Another barred window&quot; & &quot;Two very close toilets.&quot; This does not surprise me for a room called the Jesus room.
<br><br> 
<center><u>Chapel Photos</u></center>
<br><br>
&quot;Door in chapel&quot;: Orb sightings mainly in top left of pic, though range from left of door from floor to ceiling
<br><br> 
<center><u>Admin Building Photos</u></center>
<br>
<ul>
<li>4th pic down- &quot;The 'moving' chair&quot;: Go from left arm of chair to right of pic. Orb!<br><br>
<li>8th pic down- &quot;Room w/ the moving chair&quot;: 1) possible orb top center near ceiling 2) angry &quot;face on wall&quot; in a darker shade 3) possible &quot;eye&quot; right of sprinkler<br><br>
<li>Note: Linda was brave for sitting in the moving chair. I don't see anyone w/her. I know I'd of sat in it. Damn straight. Kudos to her.<br><br>
<li>10th pic down- &quot;Torn up fireplace&quot;: Look at left window. Look just above the reflected flash & sliding part of window. Someone's watching... I see an eye.<br><br>
<li>18th pic down- &quot;Platform on 2nd floor&quot;: orb located in close to top right corner of room. (Also, note a shadow in the right window. Runs the length of the window. What was out there?)<br><br>
<li>19th pic down- &quot;Locked door.&quot;: locked for a reason? Orb spotted on right side of door, on vertical carving (at top.)<br><br>
<li>21st pic down (last pic)- &quot;Stairs to 3rd floor.&quot;: orbs at top of stairs near ceiling & one faint at top of stairs on left<br>
</ul>
<br>
<center><u>Solitary Confinement Pics</u></center>
<br>
<ul> 
<li>5th pic down- &quot;Dark hallway to solitary cells&quot;: You weren't alone. 2 orb sightings (one bottom right of pic & on right wall, about 1/2 way up) & a white blurry thing at the very end of the hall.<br><br>
<li>Last pic- &quot;Bed in solitary cell&quot;: 1) sheets look crumpled 2) orb sightings- left wall, near top left & left wall & up slightly from left pillow corner. 3) possible eye under top orb {Also, look at sheets closely. It really seems like someone's still sitting on them. Also, possible pair of eyes on bottom half of blue cover on bed.}<br> 
</ul>
<br>
<center><u>Cell Block Photos</u></center>
<br>
<ul> 
<li>9th pic down- &quot;Dark row of cells.&quot;: not alone. At end of row on right- orb. On left wall, nearer ceiling, faint orb.<br><br>
<li>12th pic down- &quot;Inside another dirty cell.&quot;: Tell me you see something orange to the left on the bed. Orb at top near ceiling, orb at bottom near leg of bed/bunk. Seems to be a figure in orange or red. What were the jail clothes back then?<br><br>
<li>14th pic down- &quot;Looking downstairs&quot;: 2 orbs located on top level<br><br>
<li>15th pic down- &quot;Room filled w/ dirt & paint chips&quot;: What is that on the right side of the window? The camera flash is off the wall, not the window. Too big to be dust.<br><br>
<li>19th pic down- &quot;Looking up cell block from bottom&quot;: top of pic, left of center, orb sighting<br><br>
<li>22nd pic down- &quot;Keep out!&quot;: Wonder why to keep out? Orb sightings- left staircase at very top (faint, may not be an orb.) Same staircase, about 1/2 way down, another possible. However, top center of pic is 3/4 of an orb but no doubt an orb.<br><br>
<li>26th pic down- &quot;Dark cell block.&quot;: maybe dark, but not alone. Look on floor near left wall. About center of pic, volia! Hello. Faint, but there.<br><br>
<li>33rd pic (or 2nd from last)- &quot;Looking down from 3rd tier.&quot;: 1) little right from center, orb on brick wall & 2) little left from center & a little lower, orb on brick wall by pipe <br>
</ul>
