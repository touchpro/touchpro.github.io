On August 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Cyn about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I remember when I was 13. I had asked my aunt for an Ouija Board for Christmas (to this day I don't know why she would actually buy one for me, knowing that almost all the females in our family are &quot;sensitives&quot;). She sat down with me to use it after dinner, and I remember I was wearing a Nirvana shirt at the time. So it was no suprise when the spirit told me its name was Kurt Cobain. I was like okay, cool, whatever. Like it was just trying to make me feel comfortable by associating himself with something I liked. My aunt only stayed with me talking to the board for maybe 10 minutes or so, then she said she was done with it, but I wanted to contiune talking to &quot;Kurt.&quot; I knew better than to use the board alone, but I did it anyway. At first Kurt seemed really nice, always talking sweet to me about this and that, so I got to where all I wanted to do was just sit alone talking with my board. I would rush home everyday from school to play with it alone. Then something weird started to happen. I had already had the board for about a month. I remember talking with Kurt and almost being able to &quot;hear&quot; what he was saying in my head. Like instead of just seeing the words being spelled out, I would feel and hear the feeling and expression behind it. It got to where I could &quot;hear&quot; him so much that I would hold converstions with him while I was at school and the board was at my house. It got to the point that no matter where I went, I was never without Kurt. I was holding full, all day long converstaions in my head with him without touching the board in almost a month by this time (all in all, I had the board for maybe 5-6 months).
<br><br>
One day after school, out of the blue, I went to the board again, and someone else by the name of Mary showed up. Mary was never as nice as Kurt had been. Mary would always want to argue with me, or say mean things to me. She would always say how ugly and fat I was. Mary was so much stronger than Kurt, and would chase him away. I would be sitting in class and I could hear arguments between the two of them. I felt like I was starting to go crazy. I finally just became depressed from it all. I had so many friends and was always really into school, but I found I just didn't care anymore. I dropped out of school for 3 months, and just locked myself in my room. I didn't want to see anyone. This was after Mary was trying to tell me Kurt was going to rape me, and I was pregnant. I couldn't understand this because I was still a virgin. So shortly after this, my grandma sent me to counseling for my depression. I remember when I was asked what was wrong, both Mary and Kurt would get angry at me, telling me not to say anything about them (like anyone would believe me anyway?). I didn't, and was put on Prozac. Finally one day I had enough. I took my board to a friend's house where her dad tried to help me out. He talked to the spirits, and he forbid me to ever use it again. He said they were very evil and I need to get away from it asap. I remember the whole time I was there, Mary and Kurt where cussing at me, and calling me nasty names.
<br><br>
After that trip I didn't really hear from Kurt too much anymore, it was all Mary. She was now trying to get me to kill myself, telling me how horrible of a person I was, how f-up I was, and that God could never love something as pathetic as me. I finally told my aunt what had been going on, and she helped me dispose of the board. I also prayed and prayed to God to help me get rid of them. I'm happy to say that the board as well as Kurt and Mary are gone now. Even though this happened 13 years ago, I haven't touched another board since then. And to be honest, I'm still afraid in the back of my mind that it might show back up one day. I really wish I had never asked my aunt for one, but I learned a very important leason. It is not a game.
