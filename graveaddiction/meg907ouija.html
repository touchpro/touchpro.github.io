On September 18, 2007 I received an e-mail from Meg M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I grew up in a small, historical town in Upstate NY called Goshen.  The town has a lot of history in it.  Take a gander on wiki some time if you're interested in reading up on Goshen.  Anyway, back to my story.
<br><br>
When I was maybe 12-13 years old, I had a good friend named Alex.  He and I were interested in a lot of the same things.  Wicca, magick, tarot, runes, etc.  We formed a close friendship quickly and we were close to inseparable.  One day we were at the nearby mall in the bookstore and he noticed a box that said The Psychic Circle on it.  This is a variation of the Ouija board.  It was a bit more colorful, and round instead of square, and the planchette was a round glass piece.  He really wanted it but didn't have the money.  His birthday was coming up, so I asked my parents if they would help me get it for him for his birthday.  They agreed and I bought it.
<br><br>
On his birthday, I gave it to him and he was thrilled with it.  We decided to go to one of the many cemeteries in the town to use The Psychic Circle.  It was late afternoon, after school and dinner.  We found a bare-ish spot that wasn't directly on top of a grave and sat down and opened the box.  We set up the board on the ground and started to ask it questions.  Mind you, this was quite a while ago, so my memory isn't serving me as it would if it happened yesterday.  I remember the board telling us we were speaking with a very young boy.  Around the age of 4 or 5 years old.  We asked a couple of questions, and I recall feeling positive during this.  Suddenly, I felt a freezing cold shock run up my arm.  Alex and I both jerked our hands off of the board and looked at each other in amazement... kind of like...&quot;Did you just feel that?!&quot;  We hurried up and packed the board away because dusk was starting to fall.  We went back to my house, and later he went home.
<br><br>
The next day, Alex came over with our friend, Derek.  We decided we wanted to show Derek the board, so we set it up on the floor of my bedroom.  We began to ask it questions, and we weren't getting much of a response.  After some time, we began to get jumbled responses to our questions.  I do remember us asking the normal &quot;What is your name?&quot; and &quot;How old are you&quot; and &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  The board wasn't being very clear with any of the questions, except when asked &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  The response to that was &quot;MEG (my name is Meghan)&quot;  Alex asked it &quot;What about Meg?&quot; And it responded with something to the effect of &quot;Hurt or Harm.&quot;  He asked the board if it was going to harm me and it said &quot;Yes.&quot;  The temperature in the house felt like it was 120 degrees.  We all felt stifled and hot like we were in a dry sauna.
<br><br>
With that, I freaked out and asked them to stop it and put the board away.  They did and we were so freaked out, we took the board and threw the whole box into the sewer drain (yeah I know...I littered.  Bad girl.)  Alex called a friend of his and she walked him through how to do a simple cleansing of the house.  He did and the guys left.  I had this horrible heavy feeling all night.  I thought I saw a shadow on the wall that was darker than anything that could have been shadowing from the room.  I just had this lingering BAD feeling.  I don't know how to describe it.
<br><br>
After a rough sleep, I woke up the next day.  And I swear to you...that friggin planchette was sitting on my dresser.  I had put it in the box and thrown it downt he drain with the rest of the box.  And there is sat, like it was neatly placed there for me to see it.  I grabbed it, walked outside and threw it as far as I could. I didn't tell anyone (my sister/mom or dad) about it because I figured it would scare my little sis.
<br><br>
I still felt uneasy about the incident, and I suddenly had this fear of the dark.  I had to keep my door closed and locked at night to keep the dark out.  I slept with my light on. No matter how bad I needed a drink or had to use the bathroom, if no one was up and it was dark, I would stay in my room.  This really was a very sudden and serious fear that I hadn't had before this incident.
<br><br>
A few nights passed, and I had this HORRIBLE graphic dream.  I have never had one like it before, or since.  I remember every detail of the dream.  My mom had a bi-level house.  We were sitting in the living room on the upper floor where there was a big bay window.  The large couch was against the bay window and the loveseat was against the railing leading to the stairs.  I was sitting on the loveseat and my mother on the large couch.  My little sister and her friend were playing on the floor.  I heard a tapping on the window behind my mom.  I said, &quot;Mom, did you hear that?&quot;  She replied with a &quot;yeah, it was probably the wind.&quot;  I heard the tapping again, this time it was louder and faster.  I looked again and saw a pair of glowing disembodied eyes outside the window.  I screamed and the girls screamed.  The &quot;thing&quot; broke through the window.  It maimed my family and left me to watch in horror.  I was paralyzed with fear in this dream.  It took the bodies of my mother sister and her friend and butchered them and boiled them to bones.  It strung the bones up like garland around my house and then told me it would be back for me...and was gone.  Then the police came and my father...and I woke up, terrified.
<br><br>
The next morning, my sister came to me...as white as a sheet.  She described the exact dream I had that night.  I can't help but wonder if maybe the Ouija experience and the dream were somehow related.  For years following, I had a horrible fear of the dark.  Almost to the point of being obsessive compulsive about lighting in my house.
<br><br>
I've come to terms with my spirituality now (or the lack thereof) and have been able to banish all ill feelings about this.  Maybe not believeing in it makes it less powerful...or maybe just knowing in my head it is all just silliness helps.  But I can't deny what happened during those couple of days and I will never ever forget it.
<br><br>
Unrelated to this, in the same house...my sister has experienced some strange things, as has my older brother.  Many believe the town of Goshen is a very haunted place with a lot of activity.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  If you have the time check it out for yourself some time!
