On March 14, 2006 I received an e-mail from Craig Diessel about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Thought that I would share a story with you that my sister (33 years old) and myself (27 years old) were involved in. She had been hassling me for a few hours to have a seance, but I refused. After a while I gave in on one condition, that we DO NOT call up our father who had crossed over some 2 years earlier. She agreed and we proceeded.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone that would like to speak with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you tell me your name?<br>
Board: MFD (that is the initials of our father)<br>
<br>
I proceeded to close the board down in which I was very angry and upset as I thought my sister had done this. She was also crying and swore that it wasn't her.
<br><br>
About 20 mins later she convinced me to try again. We did and it was very odd.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: MOM, MOM, MOM<br>
<br>
Me: Who are you?<br>
Board: <i>No response</i><br>
<br>
Me: Where are you from?<br>
Board: Molland<br>
<br>
Me: Molland?? Where is that?<br>
Board: Molland<br>
<br>
Me: Is that Holland?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have something to say?<br>
Board: MOM, MOM, MOM<br>
<br>
We continued to ask certain questions about age, date of death, etc but I cannot recall exact answers. I remember doing the math and it making sense. However I never understood, &quot;MOM.&quot;  I'm not sure whether MOM means mother in Holland.&quot;
