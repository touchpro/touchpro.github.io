On April 3, 2009 I received an e-mail from Steve-O about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

One of my friends came over yesterday, Molly, and we both have dogs. I have a Chiuahua named Susie, and she brought over her Chiuahua named Sweetie. So she brought her dog over, and our dogs never fight with each other. Never. They always get along. Now we were just hanging out, and then we started talking about the Ouija board because I knew she didn't believe in it. So we started playing, but she didn't really want to play anymore. So I asked my stepfather if he would play it with me. He was a little hesitant at first, but he decided to anyway. So we started playing and this is what happened:
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone there?<br>
Ouija: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What's your name?<br>
Ouija: F-R-A<br>
<br>
Me: Is your name Frank?<br>
Ouija: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you from the sun or the moon?<br>
Ouija: Moon<br>
<br>
All at the same moment, Sweetie (My friend's dog), started crying and like half-barking/half-screeching.  Then she ran behind my brother. My stepfather looked at Sweetie, and all Sweetie did was look at me, then at the door, then at the board, then back at me, and then ran back behind my brother who was sitting on his bed. Then I started to feel a heat wave sort of flow through my body, and I felt weak. At the same time, my dog Susie started attacking Sweetie, trying to bite her and scratch her fiercely. My brother, Jordan, grabbed Susie, but Susie jumped out of his hands and hit Sweetie again. Molly started screaming and freaked out.  The candles blew out, and I almost passed out, but we closed the board. Sweetie was crying all night, and when we put the board away and opened the windows, that's when Susie calmed down. I swear on my life this is what happened, and now my friend Molly truly believes in the Ouija and won't touch the board. She made me walk her home that night, and made me bring a metal bat. Don't let dogs near you when playing the Ouija. It really works.
