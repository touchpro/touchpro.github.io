On July 28, 2008 I received an e-mail from Sydney about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was watching my favorite show, Friends. Monica and Phoebe were playing a ouija board. I wanted one. I went to a yard sale and found one for a good price. I brought it home and called my friend up. She got to my house within ten minutes. We talked to several ghosts, and a few of our relatives. We took it out two weeks later and talked to a 14 year old boy, James. He sounded nice at the start, but then started lying to us. I hadn't read up on ouija boards when we talked to James. We asked to talk to some more of our family members, and he would not let us. My friend got freaked out, so we said goodbye and put it away.
<br><br>
A couple weeks later we took it out again. It was still James. We stayed and talked for a bit, until he started to lie about his age (900,76).  He said he could tell the future, but again lied. We found that out after we asked something that we both knew the answer to. We said goodbye and put it away. My other friend and I took it out and it was still James, so we put it away. He had the pointer going all around the ouija board: M, I, W, D, and the four corners.
<br><br>
My brother is 15 and he didn't believe in spirits. So he went under the couch (I didn't like having it in my closet) and brought it to the table. I decided to play. I mean who could it have hurt, right? We took it out. &quot;Ouija board, are you ready?&quot; It went to yes.
<br><br>
&quot;What is your name?"&quot;  J. I wouldn't let him finish. I know this was mean, and I probably shouldn't have said it but...&quot;Dam, is this James?&quot;  Yes. I had a purple scented candle next to me. &quot;Can you blow out the candle?&quot; my brother asked. The candle started to go crazy. It would blow to one side and kept on going crazy. I put my hand in front of the position where I thought James was blowing at it. It stopped, and the flame kept going straight up, like nothing had ever happend. I got so freaked out. &quot;Let's put it away,&quot; my brother said.
<br><br>
We put it away without saying goodbye. My mom went to see a psychic, and out of the blue she said &quot;Tell your daughter she can tell the spirits to go away.&quot; One was following me. I got my dad to say &quot;Get the fu** out of my house.&quot;  Do you think that may have angered James? What can I do to get him gone? It feels like he is still around...I feel squeezes on my shoulders and my arms, is that him?
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Sydney, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to her.
