On December 28, 2006 I received an e-mail from Martyn M. about his interesting ouija board experiences:
<br><br><br>
My name is Martyn. I am 12 years old. I wanted to tell you about two ouija board experiences that I had when my friend Laura and I tried it. The other one was told to me by my friend Paul.
<br><br>
It was mid summer, and my friend Laura was staying at my house. So we looked up this website on google and read a couple of the stories. I was kinda scared but Laura didn't believe half of them. So we decided to make a ouija board by ourselves, with just a piece of card and a black pen. We also used just a glass see-through cup as the pointer. So we went up into my attic and lit a candle, turned off all the lights, and sat with our legs crossed across from each other, with our fingers on top of the glass. So Laura said &quot;Are there any spirits wishing to contact us",&quot; and I swear, the millisecond after she said that my phone rang. I had a heart attack, and so did Laura. We thought it was just a coincidence, so we let the phone ring. The phone wouldn't stop so I went downstairs and answered it. I picked up and no one was there, but I could hear some sort of breathing, so I hung up. I went back up and we tried again, Laura said the same thing again, and the phone rang. I answered it again and there was no one there. This time I checked caller ID and it said witheld number. So we tried one last time, and the phone rang. I answered it, once again no one there, and so I hung up, checked caller ID and it said my own house number. I was shitting it at this point so I unplugged the phone and Laura and I didn't try it again.
<br><br>
The second story was told to me by my friend Paul. Paul lives in the house with his big sister and his mom and dad. Paul's big sister had an ouija board, and they decided to use it one time. So they got it out and decided to call a spirit. Now for those of you who study witchcraft or know about it, you will know of Djinn, the King of the Fire element. Now they got in contact with Djinn, and he told them that his big sister was going to die at 2 o'clock that morning. Then they said goodbye and went to sleep. Paul slept in his big sister's room that night, and at 2AM, boxes fell out of the cupboard above their heads. Paul pushed his big sister out of the way, and she's still alive now. The boxes were filled with heavy things, and would have actually killed her if they had landed on top of her. To this day Djinn still lives in their house.
<br><br>
In August 2007 I received the following e-mail from Ruz regarding Martyn's ouija board story:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>In Paul's story, Martyn claims that Djinn is &quot;The God of Fire,&quot; which is 100% wrong (Not that I've met any :P). But it's wrong - Djinns are all kinds of elements.  They are second to humans in God's creation.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fanatic of myths and creatures of the other side and I'm not allll way too holy. But Djinn's are like us, only they aren't made of clay but instead they are made of the elements (fire, water, etc).  Some even say only smoke.  To say the terminology &quot;Djinn&quot; is one person could be wrong as it refers to a classifcation of beings. That said, I think his claims of having the &quot;God of Fire&quot; living in his house is fake.</i></blockquote>
