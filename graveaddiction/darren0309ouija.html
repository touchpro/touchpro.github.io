On March 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Darren about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

<br><br>
My name is Darren and I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma. I am currently 40 years old, and have held a fascination with the occult since an early age. I have had many bizarre experiences with Ouija boards, and I am writing this as a warning to people that bad things can happen because of these &quot;portals.&quot;
<br><br>
Parker brothers doesn't care if a demon possesses you, or if you come under some type of attack from something you know nothing about. The majority of people from The United States hold a skeptical view regarding the scientific evidence of spirits or ghosts, and many people who believe in these things also believe that it is for this very reason that ghosts and poltergeists occur here and exist &quot;under the radar,&quot; so to speak. These Ouija boards are manufactured under the precept that they are mere &quot;toys.&quot; Let me tell you first hand that THEY ARE NOT TOYS, and should be used with strict caution, and probably should not be messed with AT ALL. Other countries take a more open minded view of spirits, demons, and ghosts, and many many cultures have based entire religions from these beliefs.
<br><br>
During my experiences with Ouija boards, one particular spirit always seemed compelled to make its presence known. Its name is ZOZO. Today I refuse to even pronounce its name, as I believe the mere pronunciation of it can cause it to manifest itself. Too many times to count, it has at first pretended to be a nice spirit, or pretend to be whomever I was trying to contact. But eventually it showed its true self, cussing me, threatening me and others present in the room. Once it actually cussed me using what looked like Latin or Hebrew, and using biblical terminology. I was genuinely fascinated and startled by how many times ZOZO showed up, even in many different states and many different Ouija boards. It always wound up being very nasty, and commented freely about how it wanted to possess my girlfriends and take them to paradise. When asked where paradise was, it spelled H.E.L.L. One time after ZOZO was being extremely evil, I walked into my bathroom only to see my 1 year old daughter about to drown. Her mother had left her alone in the tub &quot;just for a second,&quot; and somehow the water got turned on and was overflowing. Instinctively she had her face tilted up and was seconds from going under when I grabbed her from the water. The next day she was hospitalized for some weird internal infection, and was put in isolation for 14 days straight as doctors tried to diagnose the illness. We almost lost her, and that was when I began to suspect demonic attack.
<br><br>
At this same time my girlfriend maintained a &quot;trance like&quot; state. Her personality changed from a very sweet person, to withdrawn, and uncaring. ZOZO said before this that it was going to possess her and eat her soul. I was recording music for a future rock project and I remember jokingly asking if it had an opinion on what I should name the band. It spelled IRON TONGUE, which at the time I thought was pretty cool, only later when my daughter's tongue swelled up in the hospital to the point of asphyxiation I realized that this wasn't cool AT ALL! Her tongue became rock hard, and distorted her face, swelling up to where it hung grotesquely from her mouth. We took turns bedside at the hospital for what seemed like forever before my daughter began to recover from this strange affliction.
<br><br>
When guests would spend the night in our house, they would claim that they heard frightening voices coming from inside the walls. Objects would be thrown across the room, and spiders seem to come from nowhere. My girlfriend's brother who lived with us complained that he couldn't sleep at night because the &quot;conversations&quot; were so loud that he simply could not rest. He believed in ghosts, and though he wasn't afraid of them, he said that it definitely felt demonic. Lights would come off and on by themselves, doors would open and unlock themselves. One night in our bedroom, a viscous laughter emanated from thin air, and to this day I cannot explain the terror in that laughter. One night I was awakened by what felt like hands on my throat choking me. I could not breathe, I could not scream. After about 30 seconds it released its grip and I gasped for air. The same thing happened to my girlfriend the next night. Another night, her brother and I were standing just outside the back porch sliding glass door when we were talking about a supposed curse of their family. I abruptly exclaimed, &quot;I rebuke this curse in the name of Jesus Christ!&quot; I no longer finished saying those exact words when a deafening sound and a vibration struck the entire house with such an alarming &quot;boom&quot; that the neighbors came over to ask if I had heard something strange. I knew it wasn't our imaginations, I got out the ladder to see what had landed on top of the house only to find nothing. Things settled down after that, and to this day I believe that whatever made that noise also caused the disturbance to go away...For awhile.
<br><br>
My girlfriend broke up with me, and I met someone online in Michigan, where I moved up to be with her. She didn't believe in spirits, and although I knew better, I decided to make her a believer as well. Living in a very small town in Marshall, Michigan there were no stores that sold Ouija boards, so I downloaded one from the internet. I printed it out, and to my horror ZOZO returned. It said it came from &quot;cyberspace&quot;...and when I asked it where it lived, it spelled &quot;SKULL NICKLACE&quot;... We didn't think much of this until I asked it again where it was, this time spelling &quot;MIRROR.&quot; There was only one mirror in the bedroom where we were crouched on the floor, and I heard a scream coming from her 7 year old niece who was watching us with another young friend. We looked up at the mirror and saw the skull necklace swaying back and forth with glowing eyes looking down at us! My new girlfriend's son had hung the necklace on one of the posts of the waterbed hours before I downloaded the paper board. We almost jumped out of our skin, and although 3 feet of fresh snow had fallen that night we all found ourselves in the front yard not knowing what to do, scared shitless, and frozen in terror. My girlfriend was so fascinated, she drove 40 miles to purchase a new glow in the dark Ouija board, much to my dismay. The next night we had another session in the same room. ZOZO immediately came forth, and even without me being a participant. My girlfriend's nieces were using the planchette, and I would secretly write down a color onto a small piece of paper, then crumple it up where NO ONE could see. I asked the young girls to ask the board if it knew which color I had written down, it quickly scooted to &quot;YES!&quot;...&quot;BLUE!&quot; I remember chills coursing up and down my spine as I threw the wadded up paper to my girlfriend. Her eyes widened as she read the written color BLUE! We then tried the same thing with shapes, and words and everytime the board knew.
<br><br>
One night we asked the board if the spirit would show itself. It spelled YES and told me to turn out the lights and take a picture of the necklace above the board. I did just that, and what turned out is eerie to say the least. On the upper left hand corner of the picture you can plainly see &quot;winged&quot; skeletons flying about, and they are of the exact same weird shape of this &quot;skateboarders&quot; skeleton necklace. Towards the middle you can make out hideous faces, I have seen at least 4 evil faces in this picture. I took this picture about 6 years ago, people have stolen it off of paranormal websites claiming they took it, when I know truthfully it was me. I have sent this picture to several &quot;experts&quot; and they have all said they cannot explain the images inside. As if all of this wasn't strange enough, now comes the REALLY scary part.
<br><br>
A few months ago I googled the word ZOZO. To my shock, many other people have also been contacted by a demon by the SAME NAME! I read about 20 similar stories and I am now convinced that this simply CANNOT be mere coincidence. Supposedly ZOZO is an ancient demon name which possibly stands for &quot;The Destroyer.&quot; Claims of demonic possession are associated with this ZOZO, and I feel it my duty to warn people to steer clear from this if it happens to present itself during a Ouija board session. I am currently researching this phenomena for a future book, and am in the initial stages of presenting my findings to a reputable demonologist who has been involved in hundreds of cases of paranormal activities across the world, including &quot;A Haunting in Connecticut.&quot;
<br><br>
What is this ZOZO? Supposedly the 3 headed dog demon which guards the gates of hell has a tattoo on it's forehead that spells ZOSO. Also, ZOZO is a term Aleister Crowley claimed meant &quot;666.&quot; Jimmy Page of the rock group Led Zepplein also used ZOSO as a symbol on the Zepplein 4 album. Could ZOZO and Zoso be connected somehow? How can so many different people from so many different parts of the world somehow lie about this ZOZO spirit? And if they aren't lying, than how can you explain these visitations by this wicked entity? Is ZOZO the devil himself? Or a wayward demon who has the power to manifest itself wherever and whenever it is called?
<br><br>
Heed my warnings people, if you are playing around with a Ouija board, and you jokingly ask it if it has a name and it spells ZOZO. Close the session properly, cleanse the house, NEVER, I repeat NEVER, ask it again. And if you are brave enough to carry on conversations with this spirit do NOT antagonize it, or act on it's directions. I know what I have seen, and I know other people have also come into contact with this spirit. It is dangerous beyond words. I realize not every session results in negativity, but when you play with this ZOZO you are playing with fire. Everything I have described here is true, and I am not exaggerating one bit. It may take me years, but I DO intend on writing a book about this, as I have many more stories that I do not have time to mention here. They all stem from true events that took place while talking to this ZOZO.
<br><br>
Folks I have been told by people wiser than myself that the spirit world is &quot;MORE REAL&quot; than this world of so called reality. Ouija boards can cause many bad things to happen in your life. I am including the Ouija Ghost picture within this submission. Maintain an open mind, and most of all BE CAREFUL!
