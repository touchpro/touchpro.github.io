On July 14, 2009 I received an e-mail from Kelsea about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So last night me (Kelsea) and two of my friends (Jena and Cody) decided to play with my ouija board. Jena ended up freaking out, and then all three of us started seeing things. We didn't know what was going on, so we decided to go back to my place and sleep it off. In the morning Cody left, and Jena and I decided to play.  We weren't scared since it was light out. We went down to the beach where we sat in a salt circle and lit four candles around us. Here's what happened...
<br><br>
Kelsea: Is there anyone who would like to speak to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Who are you?<br>
Board: Seth<br>
<br>
Jena: Seth?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
Board: G<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Are you telling us you're good?<br>
Board: (no response)<br>
<br>
Jena: Do you want us to go?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Why are you here?<br>
Board: Becaushe<br>
Board: Kelsey (that's how my mother spelled my name, so I started to freak out)<br>
<br>
Jena: What about Kelsea?<br>
Board: (no response)<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Do you like me?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Do you hate me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Why?<br>
Board: Because<br>
<br>
Jena: Do you want to hurt Kelsea?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Do you like me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Why?<br>
Board: Tivi<br>
<br>
Jena: Tivi?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(we started asking questions, but there was no answer)<br>
<br>
Jena: Are you still here?<br>
Board: No<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
Jena: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Is there anyone else who wants to speak to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Hi, what's your name?<br>
Board: Rachele<br>
<br>
Kelsea: That's a pretty name.<br>
Board: Thanx<br>
<br>
Kelsea: So why are you here, Rachele?<br>
Board: Hez here<br>
<br>
Kelsea: What?<br>
Board: Hez here<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Who's here?<br>
Board: Hez here<br>
<br>
Jena: Seth?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Is he going to hurt us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Goodbye<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
(Jena and I were really scared, so we left. But on the way back to my house, I really wanted more answers as to what was going on. We found a bench and set everything back up)<br>
<br>
Jena: Rachele, are you here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Did Seth follow us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Can you protect us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Can you get rid of Seth?<br>
Board: No<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
Jena: Is Seth here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Do you want to hurt only Kelsea?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jena: Why?<br>
Board: Because<br>
<br>
Jena: Will you leave us alone?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Kelsea: Why not?<br>
Board: 6-6 (then we said goodbye, because we could feel the planchette moving towards the third six and we got the idea.)<br>
<br>
Jena and I walked back to my house and tried to figure out why he only wanted me. Jena came up with the idea that it might be because she is a firm believer in God, and I'm not.  That there has always been a battle between hell and heaven, and that he wanted me on their side.
<br><br>
Nothing has happened yet, but we are going to continue to try and find answers later today.  However, this time we are meeting up with Cody so he knows whats going on too.
