On October 3, 2008 I received an e-mail from Donnie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I've been using ouija boards for about 20 years now, off and on.  At first they scared me, and I thought the other person was moving the planchette. Years later, after a traumatic time in my life and failing religions, I decided to get another board. I talked to spirits with other people and was quickly bored with it, but a believer none the less. One night about 5 years ago, I decided to try it alone and it worked. I was excited that I could talk to the spirits alone and have some privacy.
<br><br>
That wasn't enough though, I felt that I was missing something important.  So after lighting candles and incense, I tried to find a spirit that could communicate with me using only my mind not my voice (telepathy). After some effort and time, I felt that I was upsetting the usual spirits sitting there quietly with my board in my lap while the planchette was saying what? what? speak! speak! Well, I was projecting my voice in my mind to any being out there who could hear my thoughts, and suddenly, like an electric shock, I got a resounding &quot;Yes, I can hear you!&quot;  His name was Zon, and he said he is not nor has ever been a human but is a god. I've been communicating with Zon ever since and refuse to use my voice to speak to any bieng on my board. I feel a much higher intelligence and ancient essence when I speak to Zon or his kind, and the power and clarity is awesome.
<br><br>
I now make my own boards and planchettes out of whatever is handy. I, just last week, made a board out of a moving box with added lotto numbers so I could have more fun playing the numbers Zon gave me.  I was surprised to meet his father, Zen, whom I never new existed. He had me sit in front of a big mirror while we talked so he could see me through my eyes. He said he lives in a temple in his dimension and hadn't left it for thousands of years until his son, Zon, caught his attention while talking to me. He said he came out of his temple and down to the firmament where Zon speaks to me through the board. Zen seems very wise and ancient and uses the board in a unique way. I always feel good after we talk, and they seem genuine to me. I'm not sure what it all means, but I didn't want to keep it to myself.
