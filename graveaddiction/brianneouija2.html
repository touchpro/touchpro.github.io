On April 22, 2006 I received another e-mail from Brianne about an interesting ouija board experience she had:
<br><br><br>
My cousin, Lindsey, was playing the ouija board with me when a very strange thing happened.
<br><br>
In my last story I told you about my spirit guide, GT. He was his normal fun/rude self for a while, but I didn't feel like
talking to him. Before he had let me talk to Dug Hole, but today he wasn't going to.  We got on the board and said the usual stuff. Then GT got ticked off.  Here is what we can remember of it:
<br><br>
Me: GT, let us talk to Dug.<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: Fine then. Goodbye.<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: Yes! GoodBYE!<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
(At this point Lindsey and I decide to try to force the pointer to GOODBYE. We pulled as hard as we could, but it wouldn't move, as if it was glued to the board. We finally got it to go there, but as soon as it went over the G, it shot straight back to NO. We began to freak out.)
<br><br>
Me: Yes, GT!<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
(I finally got mad.)
<br><br>
Me: What do you want from me?!?!<br>
Board: YOUR BLOOD<br>
<br>
(It started doing the symbol for infinity, going to 666, and other signs for evil)
<br><br>
Lindsey and I finally got him to go away. Now I usually don't get shaken up by stuff like that, but I was almost in tears, and she was too.  Lindsey convinced me to get back on, so I did.  We got to talk to Dug, and he made us feel a lot better.  He told us stuff about how we could protect ourselves from GT, etc.  We said, &quot;Goodbye,&quot; and got off the board.
<br><br>
The rest of the story happens a night later.  We decided to play ouija again, so we got on the board.  Same thing happens.  We end up talking to Dug, but halfway through GT cuts in.  We got him to go away and started to talk to Dug again. He told us so many interesting things about heaven, etc. We had to say bye and get off the board for a while, but we got back on soon after that.  When we got back on, Dug was there.
<br><br>
We talked to him for a while, but GT decided that he wanted to talk to us, so he kicked Dug off. Here is what I remember of this conversation:
<br><br>
Me: GT, what do you want?!<br>
Board: NO<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you keep talking to us?!<br>
Board: LOVE<br>
<br>
(At this point, I am grossed out to the extreme. I knew GT &quot;liked&quot; me, but this went WAY over the line.)
<br><br>
Me: UH!! Bye!!<br>
Board: GOODBYE<br>
<br>
I did NOT want to touch that board again, but my cousin talked me into it. She said that she would make a deal with him, so I agreed.  The deal was that we would talk to him only if he would let us talk to whoever we wanted to talk to at that moment. If he didn't, he would be banished from my board for all eternity. Then he started to spell out DON'T YOU WANT TO TALK WITH DUG. I was amazed that he actually offered for us to do that. We talked with Dug for a while, but then we talked to GT.  He kept on saying how sorry he was for scaring us, and that it would never happen again. Here is what I remember of it:
<br><br>
Me: You got anything to tell us?<br>
Board: YES<br>
<br>
Me: What?<br>
Board: CAN I GIVE YOU A ROSE<br>
<br>
Lindsey: How're you gonna do that?<br>
(The pointer began to make all kinds of dips and turns.)<br>
<br>
Me: What's it spelling?<br>
Lindsey: It's drawing a rose!<br>
<br>
Indeed, it had drawn a rose. GT said he was tired, so we let him go.  We talked with Dug for a while, but he suddenly became mean, so we got off the board.
<br><br>
So what's up with GT? I have no clue.  Try to contact him on your board and find out.
