On June 22, 2005 I received an e-mail from Callie Kent about her scary experiences with the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Me and my mates go on the board nearly everyday.  Weird things happen all the time.  One time we talked to someone and we let it in the room and asked it to touch our faces.  It's so freaky sometimes!  The first time I asked it to touch my face it felt like a burning on my head and you could see the hair moving.  There was another time we spoke to a girl called Katie, and it would only talk to us if my brother was in the room. It made my brother's shirt collar move and flicker...it's so weird, but its also funny!
<br><br>
We've had bad times as well.  Someone said it was going to get us in our dreams...me and my mate didn't sleep all night!  We were so scared, but I've got photos on my camera from when they were in my room!
<br><br>
There have been times before when it asked me to slit my wrist for blood, and stupidly I did.  But when I did I said &quot;Do you want to taste it?&quot;, the glass went flying off the board!  You could see the blood drying up.  It's so freaky!  Even though there are bad spirits, I don't think they can hurt you, but I think its great and all.   Never go on it when you're pissed though, because you spin out like a bitch!&quot;
