I haven't posted for a few days since nothing too exciting has happened.  I've been busy at work, but the last two days went really slow.  That's unusual since the really busy days usually go by fast!<br /><br />Tuesday night I received an e-mail to my <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a> e-mail address that contained some very exciting news.  About a month ago I applied to join the Ohio Exploration Society.  It's a group for people who like to explore Ohio's abandoned/forgotten/haunted/historical places (which includes cemeteries!).  The e-mail I received on Tuesday was the e-mail with my acceptance letter!!  So now I'm a member of the OES!!  Grave Addiction really helped me get accepted since the site proves I do have some exploration experience.  There aren't any explorations planned right now due to the weather, but once it warms up/stops snowing I'll get to go on my first OES exploration.  This is so exciting!<br /><br />Another exciting thing...on Wednesday I purchased an antique wooden Ouija board that was made in the 1920's. It even has a wooden planchette (message indicator).  Antique Ouija boards are one of the most difficult board games to find.  It makes sense though.  Think about it...if someone had a Candyland game that they didn't want anymore they'd throw it away or give it to someone else.  Now a lot of people getted freaked out after using a ouija board, so instead of giving it away or simply throwing it in the trash, they'd chop it into pieces or burn it so the "evil" spirit couldn't contact them again.  Anyway, I can't wait to try this new (well, new to me anyway!) board out!  I think John, Ryan, and Amanda are going to join me for a "contact the dead party" (that's what Ryan called it!) sometime next week.  I am really curious to see if we end up talking to my great grandma (or a spirit claiming to be her) again.  Of course, I don't know who owned this board before me so I guess there could be other spirits tied to it.  The people reading this who don't believe in spirits/ghosts probably think we're crazy!<br /><br />Here are a couple pictures of the new board:<br /><br /><img src="ouija1.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="ouija2.jpg"><br><br>

I wasn't sure if many <i><a href="http://www.dispatch.com">Columbus Dispatch</a></i> readers would actually check out <a href="http://www.hoppytogether.com">Hoppy Together</a>, but since I've had 95+ hits as opposed to my 45-50 usual hits I'd say quite a few people have visited!  Even my blog which usually gets 10-12 hits a day has had over 33...this is so exciting!  A few really cool people have even signed my guestbook, and I've had fun reading their comments.  One person is the building manager at the LeVeque tower, and he offered to give me a tour sometime.  That would be really cool!  Also, one of my cousins from my dad's side of the family saw me in the paper and e-mailed me/signed my guestbook.  I hadn't heard from Pam in <b>several</b> years, it was great to hear from her!  A lot of coworkers noticed the article too.  I told my teammates about it, but a few of the programmers saw it as well.  However, coworkers in my current department weren't the only people that read the article.  I also heard from a few people that I worked with a few years ago, back when I worked in LHS (Life and Health Systems).  It really has been a fun day!!<br /><br />A ton of people took vacation/personal days or worked from home today.  If I would have been thinking I probably would have worked from home too...the drive in was terrible!  I should have known...this morning when I left to get a copy of the paper I walked only a few steps before slipping and falling!  My left hip and leg are still a little sore.  Anyway, when I was out walking to get a copy of the paper from the vending machine thingy acoss the street the roads didn't look too terrible.  However, just an hour later it was a totally different story!  It usually takes me about 20 minutes to get to work, but today it took 55 minutes!!  I didn't drive over 25 mph the whole way into work.  Even though traffic was moving super slow there were still lots of accidents.  I was relieved when I finally made it to the parking lot!  I can't complain too much about my 55 minute drive.  One of my friends, Deidee, lives in Thornville and it took her <b>3 hours and 15 minutes</b> to get into work.  She left at 6:30 and made it to work at about 9:45.  That would have been a horrible drive!<br /><br />I really am ready for winter to be over.  I really feel like working in the garden.  Also, my hands and face are getting really dry from the cold, windy weather...I've been going through lotion like crazy!  I was talking to my mom about that this afternoon, and it sounds like she's having the same problem.  To quote her, she said "my skin is scaling like a damn alligator".  That's my mom for you! :)<br /><br><br>

The article was in today's <i>Dispatch</i>!  I thought it was a really good article:<br /><br /><center><img src="./article/articlepage1.jpg"><br><img src="./article/articlepage2.jpg"></center><br /><br />I'll write more about this later, after I hear what my family, friends, and coworkers have to say about it!!<br><br>

I can't believe the day is almost over...it flew by extremely fast!!  I ended up working about an hour and a half past my regular 7.75 hour work day, but it didn't seem like I stayed late.  In fact, it seemed like I should have had about 3 hours left (I'm glad I didn't have to stay 3 more hours though!!!).  Even though it was a very busy day and I was a little stressed at times, days like this are still my favorite.  I'd rather be busy rather than bored ANY time!<br /><br />I didn't do much tonight after work.  I cleaned the fish tank and the African clawed frog tank.  That wasn't much fun at all.  I'll never get used to submerging my arm into dirty, disgusting aquarium water.  Cleaning the filter is the worst part though.  Some of the things I wash out of it make me sick!  Even though it is disgusting, the result is always worth it!  And I'm sure the fish, snails, and frogs appreciate the nice, clear water.  <br /><br />Hopefully tomorrow will be a more laid back day at work.  I only have two meetings scheduled, and one of them is non-work related.  I volunteered to help out with the Operation Feed campaign again this year.  Tomorrow we're meeting to discuss fundraiser ideas.  Last year I helped out with the campaign and had a lot of fun.  Op Feed is a big deal at Nationwide.  Each department has a goal for how much money to raise.  Also, the department gets points towards our goal when people from the area volunteer at the foodbank.  I was supposed to work at the Mid Ohio Foodbank on Tuesday night, but the shift got cancelled.  I'll probably sign up for the next one.<br /><br><br>

This morning I received an e-mail from Jeb, the reporter who interviewed me for the <i><a href="http://www.dispatch.com">Columbus Dispatch</a></i> "Life Stories" article back on January 22.  He said that the word on the street is that the story about me will appear in Monday's paper.  I honestly am a little nervous now, probably more nervous than I was before the interview!  I wonder what he wrote about me?  I wonder if I'll like an sound extremely abnormal person?  And I wonder what the title of the article will be?  Everyone keeps telling me I shouldn't be nervous, because all of the other "Life Stories" articles have been really good.  However, this article is about me....the girl with pet frogs who like to explore cemeteries and fills her place with antiques like the orange/black/brown/avacado green plaid couch and chair!! :)  A lot of people also told me that I'll be "famous".  Personally I think infamous is a better word!  Susan suggested the word "notorious"...I like that one too!  <br /><br />Today at work I watered my plants.  Since jury duty caused me to be away from the office for two weeks they didn't get watered as often as usual.  I'm sure someone watered them, because if not they probably would have been dead since our building's temperature is about the same as hell's temperature...it's HOT in there!!  This morning I noticed that the poor little cactus plants even looked dry.  So where is this story going you ask?  Well, the cactus plants are in a flower pot my friend/coworker Michelle bought me last year.  It's frog shaped (of course!), and a few minutes after I watered the plants I noticed that there was water dripping under one of the frog's eyes.  I checked and the water hadn't dripped from the top of the pot, so there must be a hole under the right eye.  It kind of made me laugh though, because it looked like the frog was weeping.  Why did that make me laugh?  Because it reminded me of all the weeping religious statues that the Catholic church recognizes as miracles.  Please don't get me wrong, I'm NOT saying that the religious statues are amusing, but comparing the frog flower pot that reminds Sheri of Marilyn Manson (she says it's something about the frog's eyes) with those statues struck me as funny!  I guess it was the visual of hundreds of Nationwiders flocking to my desk to touch the "miracle frog" so they could be healed that made me laugh.  Anyway, I've probably unintentionally offended someone so I'll change the subject now...<br /><br />Last week Mark's neighbor Alana sent him an e-mail in which she referred to Mark has her two dog's "Daddy".  One time she referred to me as their "Aunt Beth", so does that mean that Mark and I are brother-in-law and sister-in-law?!  Or perhaps brother and sister?!  If he's my brother that means I have a total of 5 siblings: 1 sister and 4 brothers since my parents call their 3 wiener dogs my "brothers"!  Actually, I shouldn't say that my parents say that, usually it's just my dad that refers to them as my brothers.  I always tell my mom that should offend her, because if the dogs are my brothers what would that make her?!?!?!?!  <br /><br />****<b>NOTE:</b>  <i>For those of you who don't know anything about dogs (or perhaps you just couldn't figure it out), mother dogs are also known as bitches!</i>****<br /><br />****<b>NOTE #2:</b>  <i>No Mommoth, I did NOT just call you a bitch, I was simply saying why calling the dogs my brothers should offend you!! :)</i>****<br><br>

I'm so mad...I just looked at the guestbook, and instead of the 700+ entries I used to have, I now have 12!!!  There's no way I can get the missing entries back.  Guess I'm going to have to look into hosting the guestbook myself instead of hosting it on another server through a free guestbooks site.<br><br>

Today I was talking on the phone with Chrissie, when she told me something that made me laugh....she didn't have the greatest Valentine's Day, so on Saturday she decided to take a bath to help herself relax.  Chrissie LOVES candles (she even referred to herself as the "candle whore"), so she lit bunches of candles and placed them around the bathroom.  She got into the tub, started to relax...and then suddenly she heard a sound.  Turns out all the candles set off the smoke detector!!  So much for a relaxing bath!!!<br><br>

It's still snowing....it doesn't seem like it will ever end!  I went out to scrape/brush the 6 inches of snow off the truck a few hours ago, but you can't tell I did anything by looking at it now.  I kind of had fun brushing the snow off though...even though it wasn't as much fun, just wading through the deep snow made me think about when I would play out in the snow as a kid.  My sister and I loved it when we got lots of snow.  We could throw snowballs at each other, sled down the hill, feed Tillie and Cherokee (the outside dogs) snow, and build snowmen.  Now that I have to go to work and drive in it, I don't get as excited about snow.  But since I didn't have to drive in it this weekend I kind of enjoyed it.<br /><br />This afternoon I watched a special called "Biography of a Corpse" on the National Geographic Channel.  It takes a lot to make me disgusted (besides needles and eye injuries of course...I can never watch that stuff), but this show succeeded in disgusting me.  It was about this place (I think it's in Tennessee) that studies the decomposition of corpses.  They take bodies donated to them (or bodies that remain unclaimed) and put them outside to study how long it takes them to decompose.  They focused on one body from start to finish, and the part that made me sick was the part where they showed the maggots and insects eating away the body.  They showed the maggots in the guy's mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.  It was really quite disgusting!!  However, at the same time I found it fascinating so I didn't change the channel.  I know it's a good/necessary thing, but I can't imagine wanting to donate my body for something like that.  <br /><br />Talking about that show made me think of another show I watched recently.  The other night I watched "Cannibal: The Real Hannibal Lecters" on HBO.  That show was interesting too.  The most disturbing person the host profiled was this guy in Japan who is still living.  He killed and ate a girl in France years ago, and they sent him back to Japan without saying that he should remain in a psychiatric hospital.  Now he's a free man, and he's actually treated like a celebrity.  He does restaurant reviews and stars in porn movies.  He told the girl interviewing him that he won't kill again, but he still dreams about eating people.  Kind of scary!<br /><br />I also want to mention that I found a really cool Ouija board site while surfing today: <a href="http://www.museumoftalkingboards.com">The Museum of Talking Boards</a>.  There is a lot of great info, including "Directions on How to Use the Ouija Board" and "Ouijastitions"!<br><br>

My term of jury service is now over (as of yesterday afternoon).  I can honestly say it was a good experience, and it really was like a two week vacation from work.  Yesterday was kinda tough though.  I ended up getting up at <b>4:15 AM</b> so I could be into work at 5:30 AM to verify a conversion!  I was NOT planning to drive into work on Friday morning, but due to some things we didn't think of until the last minute I ended up going in....it's easier to deal with problems when I'm actually in the office rather than dialed in from home.  Anyway, since I knew there were some issues with our conversion verification test plans I couldn't get to sleep Thursday night, so I went to work and jury duty after only 2 hours of sleep.  Needless to say I was exhausted last night and didn't feel like doing much.  Luckily jury duty didn't last long.  I was excused as the alternate juror around 1:30.  I guess they found the defendant "not guilty".  I actually think I would have voted "guilty".  The charge against the defendant was "inducing panic".  To make a log story short, this guy was really frustrated with some reorganizations going on at his job, and one night at work he made the comments "wonder how long it would take to get a gun at the Westerville Road gun shop" and "wonder which side of the building I should start on".  The coworker was alarmed and told his manager and another coworker about it the next day.  They ended up calling the police, and when the police questioned this guy he told them that he "doesn't give warnings, he would just do it".  The police ended up escorting him out of the building and taking his ID card.  Extra security was added to the area, etc.  So I think his comment did induce panic.  <br /><br />I haven't done much today at all.  Just played around on the internet some and did a <i>little</i> bit of cleaning.  We got 4-6 inches of snow and ice here last night, so there was no way I was going to drive anywhere.  Even if the roads were clear the mere presence of snow on the ground is enough to make people drive like idiots around here!<br><br>

I didn't think it would happen, but this afternoon I was selected as the alternate juror on the case my name was randomly selected for.  So that means that I'll get to listen to the entire trial, but unless something would happen to one of the other jurors I won't get to vote on whether or not the defendant is guilty or not guilty.  The trial has been pretty interesting, perhaps I'll post a little more info here in the blog once it's all over.<br /><br />I've found that I really have nothing to blog about after jury duty.  All I do is read, and now I get to listen to the trial that I can't say anything about.  Hopefully my posts here will get more interesting once I'm back to work!! :)<br><br>

I had a horrible headache last night, which is why I didn't blog.  I haven't had a headache like that for months...it was one of those headaches where I felt like I could get sick.  So instead of blogging I went to sleep.<br /><br />Yesterday I was impaneled on a jury.  I can't say anything about the case until I'm excused as a juror, all I can say is that it is in Judge Liston's court.  I'm also allowed to say what room I'm in but I can't remember the exact number!  The 8 jurors were finally picked this afternoon, so now I have to see if I'll be picked as the alternate juror tomorrow.  <br /><br />I didn't end up going on the Statehouse tour yesterday.  We had to walk down, and I didn't feel like walking 3 1/2 city blocks in the snow.  And I wasn't alone, only a handful of people actually ended up going!  I did get to see the zoo animals though.  They brought in a tortoise, a falcon, an anteater, an armadillo, and a red-tailed boa.  We were allowed to touch all of them except the falcon and the anteater.  <br /><br />Other than jury duty I haven't done anything else too exciting this week.  Oh, I did get the ouija board keychain in the mail that I bought on E-bay.  I just couldn't resist buying it!  It's a little replica of an Ouija board, and it has a little drawer that contains the message indicator.  It's big enough that you could actually use it, even though I've never had a situation where I've had the urge to use the Ouija board away from home!<br><br>

Today we (my parents, Katy's boyfriend Mike, and myself) took my sister out for an early birthday lunch.   We all had a fun time.  But other than that, I can't say I did much this weekend.  I did catch up on some much needed rest, and I got some cleaning done.  I also made some updates to <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com">Grave Addiction</a>.  Thursday night I added the remaining 10 <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/cemindex.html">cemeteries</a> from my last explorations to the site, and last night I added some pictures of the abandoned <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/lakin.html">Lakin State Hospital</a> in Point Pleasant, West Virginia that Jeremy sent me to the site.  He sent me some more last night, so I need to add them to the page soon.  I might try to do that tonight.  The pictures he sent make the hospital look really creepy and eerie...as a result I <b>really</b> want to make the trip down there to explore!  I'm not sure if I'll be able to wait until it gets 70 degrees to go down there (Mark says it has to be at least 70 so he doesn't freeze)!!!<br /><br />I think tomorrow they're letting all of us jurors take a tour of the State House.  I was just there back in August with <a href="pierre.html">Prince Pierre de la Ponde</a>, but I just walked through and didn't take an official tour.  I think Thursday is the jailhouse tour, I'm really looking forward to that one!  They're also going to bring in animals from the Columbus Zoo sometime this week.  The tours and animals are nice, but it kinda makes me laugh...it reminds me of conversations I have with my friend Jennifer about the field trips her third grade class takes!<br><br>

I was talking on the phone with my mom tonight when I had a <b>terrible</b> foot cramp.  You know how older people can sometimes predict the weather by their arthritis, etc?  Well, when I was five I broke the big toe on my left foot and the foot bone connected to the big toe.  Ever since I've had terrible foot cramps when there are changes in the weather, such as big temperature changes, rain/snow storms, etc.  When I have one of these foot cramps my big toe kinda sticks out to the side.  For example, hold your left hand in front of you and hold all of your fingers and thumb close together.  Move your thumb to the right so it's sticking out...that's what my foot looks like when it has a foot cramp.  This is very amusing to my family, they call it my "weather toe", and anytime it gets brought up, like in the conversation I had with my mom tonight, they crack up laughing.  Mom was laughing so hard tonight as a result of the weather toe being mentioned that she could hardly breathe.  I don't find it quite as amusing since it's very painful.  The worst is when it happens while I'm driving.<br /><br />I guess I spent a lot of time on the phone tonight.  I also talked to Mark.  I called to tell him that Jeremy, my new friend from West Virginia, explored the abandoned, haunted Lakin State Pyschiatric hospital in Point Pleasant, WV.  It sounds like he may have even caught some ghostly activity on the tape he filmed there!  Anyway, I told Mark that I can't wait until it gets warm enough that we can make a trip down there and do some exploring of our own.  That got us on the topic of weather.  Mark said that he'd like all of those people that preach about global warming to come and visit Ohio...it's freezing here and it has been for several months!!  He also said that he should go out and run his car for two hours to see if he can do his part to make a big whole in the ozone layer over Ohio so it starts to warm up!  And knowing his cars, two hours might be all the time he needs to make a <b>BIG</b> hole in the ozone!!!  I would like it to warm up, but I'm not sure that depleting the ozone layer is the way to go :)  Mark and I disagree about temperature quite a bit.  I like temperatures 72 degrees and below.  Anything above 75 and I'm feeling absolutely miserable.  Mark on the other hand likes hot weather.  For example, he told me tonight at 8:41PM that he would love it if he went outside and it was 85 degrees at night.  The thought of 85 degree weather at night makes me cringe!<br /><br />Jury Duty wasn't too bad today.  Still no trials for us to sit on.  Oh well, maybe tomorrow!<br><br>

Wow, it's almost been a week since I last blogged.  Guess you could say I've been a bit busy.  Last week I was trying to get things wrapped up for work since I have jury duty this week and next week!  And besides wrapping things up at work I didn't do anything too exciting.  Well, I did help John move some stuff to Ryan's house.  I did enjoy that, I think it's fun to help people move!! <br /><br />My first day of jury duty wasn't too bad.  Basically we just sit around and wait to see if we're needed for a trial.  I was also surprised when they said they had three computers with internet access for us to use.  I can't check my work e-mail, but at least I can check my personal e-mail addresses!!  I also learned more about our wonderful municipal court system than I ever wanted to know, but it honestly was quite interesting.  For example, I learned that if a person gets arrested for underage drinking at Polaris Amphitheatre, they are tried in the Columbus (Franklin County) Municipal Court since Polaris is in Columbus city limits, but the jury has to be comprised of people from Delaware County (not Franklin) since it's in Delaware county.  I also learned a lot about the software they use to pick jurors, etc.  So even though I was expecting these next two weeks to be terrible, I don't think it'll be bad at all.  But I do think it'll be terrible to go back to work after two weeks away...I've never had this much time away from the office.  I think it's hard to get back into the work mindset after one week, so that first Monday back after two weeks will be interesting.<br /><br />It was a wonderful day outside temperature wise, it made it into the 50's...of course, it didn't last long enough since it's supposed to fall back to the 30's by tomorrow afternoon and keep falling.  I'm so ready for spring!!!<br><br>
