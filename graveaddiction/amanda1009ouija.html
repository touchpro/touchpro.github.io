On October 14, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amanda J. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I recently had a new spirit come through. My house is getting crowded lol.
<br><br>
Jason and I got out the board like normal the other day. We said a prayer, lit candles, put protective stones around us, and began. Lately we've really been trying and asking for new spirits to come through, to learn more about the other side and to see what they have to say.
<br><br>
Me: We invite any spirits who wish to speak with us to please come into our home and talk with us. We mean you no harm and you can trust us. If you mean us any harm, you are not welcome here or invited. We surround ourselves with a white light only letting good spirits enter. All of the spirits who stay here, we appreciate you, but want to speak to someone we've never spoken to tonight. Is there anyone here with us?<br>
Board: (after a few minutes) yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who is this?<br>
Board: Nick<br>
<br>
Me: Your name is Nick?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old are you Nick?<br>
Board: 38<br>
<br>
Me: You're 38?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where did you come here from?<br>
Board: I was in New Mexico<br>
<br>
Me: What were you doing there?<br>
Board: Watching<br>
<br>
Me: Watching over people?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: People you love?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: When did you die?<br>
Board: 1999<br>
<br>
Me: That's not that long ago. Did you have a wife?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is she still alive?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you miss her?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been to heaven?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: You haven't? Are you stuck on earth?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: Have to pay for sins first<br>
<br>
Me: Then you'll get to go to heaven?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: That's sad. I go on a website a lot and some of the stories say that nobody in heaven can talk through Ouija boards, is that true?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: So everyone that I talk to is in Hell or still on earth?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: You are a good spirit though?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What was your job when you were alive?<br>
Board: Teacher<br>
<br>
Me: What did you teach?<br>
Board: 9th grade<br>
<br>
Me: No, what subject did you like to teach?<br>
Board: History<br>
<br>
Me: What's your favorite historic thing to teach about?<br>
Board: Egypt<br>
<br>
Me: Egypt?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have the ability to move things?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Will you move something for us?<br>
Board: Not now<br>
<br>
Me: Ok. Why is it that some spirits can move things and others don't have enough energy to? What makes some stronger?<br>
Board: depends how you died<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: Cancer<br>
<br>
Me: I'm sorry.<br>
Board: thank you<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have anything you want to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: To which one of us?<br>
Board: You<br>
<br>
Me: What is it?<br>
Board: Sing<br>
<br>
Me: I do sing.<br>
Board: Live to sing<br>
<br>
Me: I do, it's my favorite thing to do.<br>
Board: There is power in your voice<br>
<br>
Me: Is it a gift from God?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Well I'll keep using it.<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Me: Have you ever heard me sing?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: How do you know this then?<br>
Board: We all know<br>
<br>
Me: Did you know either of us before you heard us invite you tonight?<br>
Board: (moved in between no and yes)<br>
<br>
Me: Did you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Which one?<br>
Board: Jason<br>
<br>
Jason: How did you know me?<br>
Board: You are a miracle<br>
<br>
Jason: Because of when I was a baby?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(*Spirits have told us in the past that Jason has a special &quot;connection&quot; with the spirit world because he was &quot;supposed&quot; to die when he was really ill as a baby)<br>
<br>
Me: Well how do you know about that if you don't know him?<br>
Board: He is known<br>
<br>
Me: Wow, that's pretty cool. Well, Nick, you are welcome to come back at any time ok?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: We are going to go to bed. Thanks so much for talking!<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>

We moved into our house in May, and found that there was one spirit who permanently lived in our house. Slowly we invited more in and its so cool that they all seem to stay once we talk with them a few times. At first, the only one who we could contact at any time was Tom, who died in our house in the 80's. Now we can talk to any of them that have come speak with us over the months. It's a really cool thing. Thanks for letting me share.
