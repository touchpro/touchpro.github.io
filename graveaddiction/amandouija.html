On August 10, 2005 I received an e-mail from Amanda Blair about her creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My friend had this ouija board, and I decided to &quot;play&quot; with it. So we waited until the sun went down, then we went to this community park to mess around with it. At that time we had another friend with us. We started to mess around with it, and a spirit had come through. He told us his name and then for some reason he told one of my friends to &quot;BEWARE&quot;. After that my friend got freaked out, and so did I. But I was still wanting to talk to the spirit that we had contacted. As the night went on we talked to the same spirit, he was very friendly with us. We later went back to my house and lit candles and turned off all the lights. I was hoping to contact my deceased father.  We had asked the ouija if we could enter and it said yes. So then we asked if there were any spirits that wanted to come through. Evidently the candles started to flicker and the planchette answered yes. A girl came through named Catherine. She wasn't very nice. After we started talking to her, she quit for a few minutes. I looked behind me and my dog was running back and forth through my living room with my purse around her neck. She was running as if she had seen something and was frightened. After that had happened we told Catherine goodbye. We went ahead and tried to contact my dad. We  moved down to the floor and I asked for my dad to come through, and from what the ouija told us it was him. After a few minutes of talking to him the candles started to flicker so bad they almost went out and our whole left side went cold. We thought we were just imagining it when we saw my dog laying beside me under the table looking up like there was someone standing next to us on our left side. That went on for awhile. After we were done talking to my dad, another spirit came through named Dan.  He automatically did not like us. He was telling us scary things. We had asked him if he was an evil spirit and he told us yes. So after that we were pretty freaked out for the night.  We told all the spirits that we had contacted and the ones that were there waiting to come through goodbye. We put the board up and layed down to go to sleep when all of a sudden my couch would just start to shake. We eventually moved back into my bed. I had gotten up to go to the bathroom later on in the night and when I came back in my friend looked suprised that I was back in. She felt someone get in the bed with her and thought it was me. But I was still in the bathroom.
<br><br>Some helpful advice, if you are afraid you are going to contact evil spirits, say a prayer before you use the board and definetly afterwards.&quot;
