Ah, relief...I have contacts again.  My eye exam went well tonight.  The vision in my right eye stayed the same, but it got a little worse for my left eye.  Both of my eyes used to be equally bad, now I have two different contact prescriptions.  At least my eyes are still in good shape, I always worry that something really bad will go wrong with them and I won't be able to wear contacts anymore.  I worry too much.<br /><br />I also got the oil changed in the truck tonight, that wasn't too much fun.  I know it only takes 10-15 minutes, but it seems a lot longer.  But tonight I got lucky and didn't have to wait in line.  And now Chuck the Truck is happy again!  I also filled up the gas tank since it's down to $1.60 (it's pathetic that I'm excited about getting it for <i>only</i> $1.60!).  I'm so glad my truck is just a V-6, I probably wouldn't be able to afford gas for something bigger!!<br /><br />Tomorrow night I'm helping John move a mattress to Ryan's house.  I really do love hauling stuff in the truck!  I was supposed to go to dinner with a friend from high school, Jennifer, but she had other plans too (family dinner night), so we've rescheduled that for Friday.  Usually February is a rather boring month for me, but this year it's been crazy!!  I think next week is going to be another week just like last week, so I'll warn you now that I may not be able to blog much.  <br /><br />I can't believe tomorrow is only Wednesday, it feels like it should be Thursday.  Oh well, at least the week is almost half way over.  Not that things have been going bad this week, I just can't wait until Saturday so I can sleep in and catch up on my rest!!!!!<br /><br><br>

First things first...my answers to this week's <a href"http://mmadness.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Monday Madness</a>.  The rules were to pick one letter of the alphabet and then use that letter for all of your answers.  I picked the letter &quot;f&quot;, because f is for frogs, my favorite animal!  Anyway, my answers:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Name two types of food that you could care less if you ever ate again.</b><br><br>Flan (I hated the texture!) and french fries (I'm honestly not a big french fry fan...yeah, I know that's weird!).<br><br><br /><li><b>Name one animal</b><br><br>Frog (like I said, frogs are my favorite!)<br><br><br /><li><b>List three words to describe yourself.</b><br><br>Friendly, funny, fabulous (the fabulous makes me sound real modest, doesn't it?!)<br><br><br /><li><b>Name two things you might find at a zoo.</b><br><br>OK, the first (and only two things) I can think of are going to be my answer to the next question.  So I'm going to get creative.  <b>F</b>ighting kids and flies.  I always see lots of kids at the zoo, and most are fighting with their siblings, parents, friends, etc.  And I do see a lot of flies because some of the animals really smell :)<br><br><br /><li><b>Name three things you might find living in the water.</b><br><br>Fish and Frogs...you can see those at the zoo too!<br /></ol><br />My day was pretty good.  I had a really busy morning at work, but my afternoon wasn't too bad.  I did have a crisis though...my contacts always dry out at work, and this afternoon one of them fell out.  No big deal, happens all the time.  Well, this time it fell on the floor.  I tried to find it, but I couldn't see it anywhere.  So I decided to push my chair back...and when I did that I ran right over the lost contact and tore a big chunk out of it.  It's about time for me to go for my annual eye exam, so of course I usually wait to get my contacts then.  And guess what...that was my LAST PAIR OF CONTACTS!  See, it's terrible to wait til the last minute for stuff like that.  I called every optometrist in Columbus, and I finally found a place that could get me in for an exam tomorrow afternoon.  Going without contacts will suck.  I can hardly see without them, and my glasses are hideously nerdy...I don't know what I was thinking when I picked them out 4 years ago.  Oh well, I'm sure I'll survive.<br /><br />This coming weekend isn't too excited, but I'm really excited about next weekend.  Next Friday night I'm going on a ghost hunt here in Columbus with another paranormal research group.  Then next Saturday I'm off to <a href="malabar.html">Malabar Farm</a> in Mansfield, OH to meet with the director/writer of the Ceely Rose play I saw this past October.  He e-mailed me and invited me up to talk about some of the strange things he and the other people in the play experienced while rehearsing there.  That should be really fun too!  I have a feeling 2004 will be a very busy year for <a href="index.html">the site</a>.  I hope Kate is ready, because I'm hoping she'll do lots of cemetery exploring with me once it warms up!  It's so cool to have a friend like Kate who enjoys this sort of stuff too, my other friends hate it!<br /><br />OK, I think that's it.  I'm so proud of myself for blogging two days in a row...it's been awhile since I've done that!  I'm going to try and blog again tomorrow night and make it three in a row!!<br><br>

So I finally had a chance to blog last week and what happened...my webhosting company was having problems <b>again</b> and I couldn't FTP anything to my site.  Luckily I found out about the FTP problem before I wrote that big, long entry I promised, I would have been really angry had I found out afterwards.<br /><br />OK, these serial shootings around Central Ohio are getting really scary.  Yesterday I went down to my parents house.  I was running late, so I was already irritated, I hate being late.  Traffic was really light on I-70 though, so at least I had that going for me.  Until I was about a mile and a half from OH-310 anyway...traffic was completely stopped.  Which is weird, because traffic never backs up there.  I saw a sheriff with his lights flashing behind me, so I thought there must be a wreck.  He had trouble getting past all of us though since we couldn't pull over.  I finally got up to where the flashing lights were, but there weren't any wrecked cars.  There were deputies searching around in the grass below the Etna Road overpass, and there were even more deputies on top of the overpass.  I thought that it must be another shooting, but then decided that it probably wasn't since I was in Licking County, not Franklin County where all of the other shootings happened.  I didn't really think about it the rest of the day.  Then at 11PM last night my mom called me and told me to turn on the <a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com" target="_blank">news</a>....turns out a shooting was the reason traffic was stopped on I-70 yesterday!!!!  And they said it was linked to the Franklin County serial shootings.  I am soooooooo glad I was running late yesterday, that could have been my truck that was shot.  So now this guy is getting bold enough to shoot in broad daylight.  It's scary, who knows when he'll strike next?!  Everytime I drive down the freeway and see an overpass I think about it.  But what can you do, you can't stay inside all day and not drive.  I hope they catch him soon.<br /><br />I really like my new job.  It's 1000x better than the old one.  My coworkers are friendly, helpful, and patient.  They're a lot of fun too.  I already have assignments, which makes me a little nervous since I'm still learning.  But I think I'm doing OK so far.  <br /><br />Lat week really was the busiest week I had for a long time.  Monday night I went over to my friend Mark's house.  He wanted me to come over for a &quot;photo shoot&quot;.  His girlfriend recently broke up with him, so he's been trying to meet new people through online dating sites.  He wanted to get some new photos of himself, and since I have a digital camera he asked me to come over and take them for him.  I got over there, and he showed me some of the people he has been chatting with.  Then we started the photo shoot.  He had 5 or 6 outfits that he changed into, and he posed in various locations throughout his house.  I never, ever thought I'd be doing a photo shoot with Mark, it definitely wasn't how I had planned spending my Monday evening, that's for sure :)  It was fun though.  He even made me dinner.  We watched an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard while we ate, it's not every night that I get to do that!<br /><br />Tuesday night I went over to my friend Kate's house.  We both had a craving for Mexican food (OK, so both of us are ALWAYS craving Mexican food!), so we went to Senior Antonio's again.  That place is great!  I had fun seeing Cordy, her adorable little dog, and this time I got to meet Bella, her bunny.  It was a fun night!<br /><br />Wednesday night was the night I had planned to blog, but since I couldn't do that I stayed up most of the night working on the Fisher Catholic/Bishop Fenwick High School Alumni Association newsletter that I need to have finished by March 1.  Even though I worked on it for hours, I'm not even close to being finished.<br /><br />Thursday night I drove down to Lancaster to meet with Mike about the Alumni Association newsletter.  He has a bunch of additional articles for me to add to the next newsletter, but at least he has them all written.  Even though it is a lot of work, I do enjoy doing it.<br /><br />Friday night I stayed at home and tried to recuperate a little.  I was exhausted, I fell asleep around 9PM, which is really early for me!<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, yesterday I went down to my parents' house.  My mom and I went dress shopping.  Both of us wanted to find a dress to wear to my cousin's wedding in New Orleans.  Luckily we both found one, so now that's out of the way.  I hate dress shopping...really, I hate shopping for clothes in general.  I'd rather be shopping for antiques or something :)<br /><br />Today I slept in late, then went to a few cemeteries.  I visited a three in Pickaway County, and one in Franklin County.  I hope to add them to the site later this week.  I had fun, it was a beautiful sunny day.  But it was freezing!!!<br /><br />Let me think, did I forget anything?  I did.  Kathy, one of my plecos (those fish that suck on the sides of the aquarium) died last week.  I found her Monday morning.  I bought Kathy in January 1999, so she was over 5 years old.  I read once that the average lifespan is 3 years.  When I bought Mark and Kathy they were tiny, maybe 2 inches long.  When she died, Kathy was about 12 inches.  I feel bad for Mark, I think he misses her.  But I bought two new plecos to replace her, I named them Ben and Carol.  They are tiny little things, and they look extremely little next to Mark.  Hopefully they'll live as long as Kathy did.  <br /><br />Well, I think that's it.  This week should be a little calmer, so I should be able to blog more regularly!<br><br>

I really did plan on updating the blog tonight since it's been ages (well, over a week anyway!) since I last updated, but the site update I did ended up taking a bit longer than I had estimated.  I have a million things to write about - the new job, the interesting events of last night, the dinner I had with Kate tonight, etc - but since I'm completely exhausted and worn out I'm going to put off blogging for yet one more night.  I have nothing going on tomorrow night (finally!), so I have no excuse NOT to blog!  And I'm also planning on catching up on reading/commenting in everyone else's blogs too :)<br /><br />So for now, you can check out the update I made to the main part of the site by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />I'll really do promise that I'll post a big, long entry tomorrow!!!!<br /><br><br>

So last week was another bad week for my blog, wasn't it?!  It was a busy week, especially at work.  Last week was my last week in IA Systems, so I was busy packing and saying goodbye to everyone.  Plus, as usual, there was a lot of drama involving a couple of my other coworkers that distracted me from the blog.  But tomorrow I start in Life Systems!  I'm really excited about starting in the new area, it will be so nice.  I moved and unpacked all of my stuff on Friday so everything is ready for tomorrow!  <br /><br />Other than all of the stuff at work, last week was pretty uneventful.  And since I try to limit what I write about work in my blog I don't have much else to say.  So I'll go ahead and answer the <a href="http://www.simplyjeanne.com/brunch/index.htm" target="_blank">Sunday Brunch</a> and the <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="_blank">Friday Five</a> (that I obviously didn't answer last week!).<br /><br />Here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.simplyjeanne.com/brunch/index.htm" target="_blank">Sunday Brunch</a>:<br /><br /><b><u>MOODS</u></b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>What is your mood right now?</b><br><br>I'm in a really good mood, although a little anxious and excited about starting the new job tomorrow.<br><br><br /><li><b>What is the most irritating thing you've had to deal with this past week?</b><br><br>Some of my old coworkers :)  Especially the ones I really didn't get along with acting like they were my best friends just because I was leaving.<br><br><br /><li><b>What made you laugh this past week?</b><br><br>Lots of things!  The thing that sticks out in my mind right now though is last night at dinner...I went to dinner with my family, and my sister was talking about the new sweater she was wearing.  Mom said something about Katy's new sweater being wool, and Katy said &quot;it's not wool, it's made out of rabbit&quot;.  Her sweater was angora, and she must have been thinking about angora rabbits!  We had to explain that no, it's wool from big, fluffy goats, not little rabbits!  Can you imagine shearing a rabbit?! <br><br><br /><li><b>Who makes you laugh the most?</b><br><br>I don't think I can pick one person, there are so many people who make me laugh!<br><br><br /><li><b>Are you most often relaxed, bored, busy or stressed?</b><br><br>If I had to choose one of those to describe me, I guess I'd have to choose busy.<br /></ol><br />And now my answers to last week's <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org" target="blank">Friday Five</a>:<br /><br /><b>You have just won one million dollars:</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Who do you call first?</b><br><br>My parents.<br><br><br /><li><b>What is the first thing you buy for yourself?</b><br><br>The first thing I'd do is pay off all my bills and the truck, then I'd go house hunting!  Even if I didn't have a ton left after sharing it with my family, I'd at least have a really nice down payment!<br><br><br /><li><b>What is the first thing you buy for someone else?</b><br><br>I'd definitely buy something for my parents and sister, I'd let them pick!  Actually, I'd probably just give them a share of the money so they could do whatever they wanted to with it.<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?</b><br><br>Yeah, I'd give some to my family.<br><br><br /><li><b>Do you invest any? If so, how?</b><br><br>Yeah, I'd invest some. <br /></ol><br><br>
