On April 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Paige W. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was reading all the stories about ouija boards on your site. It got me thinking of when my friend and I used an ouija board about 5 years ago.  Well, I dont remember all the story exactly, but I do remember some specific things.
<br><br>
I know that I said the Lord's Prayer before we used it.  Some of the times we used it in her room, and other times we used it in my bathroom (we thought it had to be dark in the room).  We used one of those glow in the dark boards from Toys R Us. But anyway, I remember asking to talk to my grandma, and I asked &quot;Is there anything you want me to do?&quot;  It told me &quot;dye.&quot;  That freaked me out, so I said, &quot;Do you mean dye my hair?&quot; It said yes, and I asked what color I should dye it. The board said &quot;greem.&quot; I then asked if it meant &quot;green,&quot; and it said yes.
<br><br>
It said some other very freaky things, but I remember that most specifically. Also, it would spell out random things and go on forever when I would ask it for its name, because I knew it wasn't my grandma. My friend also asked to talk to her grandma, but I have a feeling it was just a spirit playing a trick on us.
<br><br>
Another time we used it in my bathroom, and I don't really remember anything specific, but I know for a fact none of the times we used it we never said goodbye or closed the board correctly, because we didn't know to do so.  After reading things on your site, I know why you should do that now.  Because the few days followng that one time of using it in my bathroom, I started to get very depressed. It only lasted a short whle, but I had the urge to cut myself (I don't know why, because normally I would never, ever even think of doing that, nor do I do it...it was very out of my personality to think like that).
<br><br>
I had a poster of a band I liked hanging up in my bathroom (the same one we used the ouija board in), and when I woke up the day after, I saw on the poster that each member of the band had little x's on their eyes. One of the band members had 3 slashes across their neck. I took the poster down, and the 3 slashes went through to the wall. I thought maybe someone in my family did it, and they said they didn't. I knew they were telling the truth. I know that I didn't do it, and no one else did...but now that I think of it, I feel like I know what it was...it was because I never said goodbye.
<br><br>
Nothing extremely bad has happened, except that I seem to have VERY bad luck...always. But that might just be me, haha.
<br><br>
I also hate being alone, because I feel as if something else is in the room with me...no matter where I'm at.  It creeps me out, but I only think about it when I read stuff about ouija boards or anything to do with it.  I VERY MUCH believe in spirits, and the fact that they can be good or evil. I have seen my grandma when I was very very young, a few days after she died...she was also wearing the same thing she wore when she died, which I didn't know until I told my dad about what she was wearing.
<br><br>
I don't know...I'm very interested in ouija boards, but this stuff REALLY freaks me out.  Because I know it's real.
