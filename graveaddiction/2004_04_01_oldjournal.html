I can't believe it, I actually have some free time to blog tonight!  I should be cleaning since I didn't get a chance to do it this weekend, but I blogging sounded like more fun.  So while I'm waiting for my laundry to finish drying I'll write.<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to write about it last week, but on Wednesday night I had a terrible, horrifying experience.  I just got home from work, and I was reaching into the mailbox to get my mail.  Well, before I could get the mail out, one of those awful big, black, hairy, jumpy spiders crawled out of the mailbox, <b>right beside my hand</b>!!!!  I screamed and jumped back, I'm sure my neighbors in the apartment complex got a kick out of watching me!  Anyway, my sudden movement frightened the spider and it crawled back inside the mailbox.  That really upset me, because I didn't know how to get my mail out...there was NO way I was putting my hand in there with the spider.  I came up with an idea pretty fast.  I rushed inside and grabbed a fork, which I then used to pry my mail out of the box and onto the ground.  I glanced inside the mailbox and the spider was still in there.  I went back inside and got the Spider Killer Plus spray out of the closet.  I know I've mentioned it before, but Spider Killer Plus is one of the best things ever made for people like me who can't get close enough to a spider to squash it.  Anyway, I sprayed the inside of the mailbox down.  I used so much spray that there was a layer of white liquid covering the entire bottom of the box :)  I watched the spider writhing in pain, and finally it stopped moving and curled up into a little ball.  I never did take the dead spider out of the mailbox...<br /><br />So tonight I got home and brought in my mail.  When I laid it on the table I noticed something small and black fall off one of the envelopes.  Yeah, you guessed it...the dead spider.  The thing is, I sort of forgot about it.  So when I saw that small black thing move I screamed because I thought it was a living spider.  I felt pretty stupid when I realized that it was the dead one.  I'm just thankful no one was here to see me jump and scream :)<br /><br />Hmmmm, what else has been going on?  Pretty much the same old stuff.  Work is still going well, and Mark still won't give in and let Pat paint the Brown Beast lime green.  He obviously doesn't care about public opinion, because the majority of you voted for the LGB!<br /><br />This weekend there was a Civil War reenactment at the park next to my parents house.  Well, I wouldn't really call it a true reenactment since they didn't fight any battles, it was more like an encampment.  They did have three cannons though, and they fired them throughout the day and once again around 9PM.  My mom invited a few people down for a bonfire/cookout.  It was a lot of fun!  She's all ready to plan another cookout sometime in May, I'll have to invite my team from work next time.<br /><br />I really can't think of anything else exciting to write about.  May is shaping up to be a busy month, so hopefully I'll have more exciting things to write about then.  <br /><br />I think my laundry should almost be finished, so I guess it's time for me to get offline for the night.  I'll try to be better about blogging this week and write again tomorrow!<br><br>

OH MY GOD!  I can't believe I almost forgot to post this entry tonight.  I promised Pat, one of my coworkers, that I'd post something <i>extremely</i> important!<br /><br />We're trying to talk one of our coworkers into getting a new paint job for one of his old cars (I'm sure my regular readers know which coworker I'm talking about!!).  Pat even offered to paint the car for him!  However, this coworker thinks the idea is absurd.  So I'm going to ask your opinions!  <br /><br />Which car looks better?<br /><br /><center><img src="brownbeastfr.jpg"><br /><br />The Brown Beast<br /><br /><b><u>OR</u></b><br /><br /><img src="lgb2.jpg"><br /><br />The LGB (Lime Green Beast)<br /><br />Make your opinion heard, submit your vote below:<br /><br /><i>I have closed this poll...the LGB won, 32 to 8!!</i>  <br /></center><br />I've been really busy this week, but I promise I'll write a longer entry before the week is over!<br><br>

My plants looked so happy outside this morning...I'm sure they'll be even happier once it starts to warm up as the day goes on!<br /><br />Anyway, my answers to this week's <a href="http://www.ki0sk.org/four/" target="_blank">Friday Four</a>:<br /><br /><b>Taxes</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Did you pay or get back?</b><br><br>I got a refund back, it was deposited in my checking account before I left for vacation.<br><br><br /><li><b>If you got back, what are you going to do with the money?</b><br><br>Well, quite a bit of my refund was spent in New Orleans, the rest I'll use to pay bills, etc.<br><br><br /><li><b>Any chance I can get some?</b><br><br>No, I'm selfish :) <br><br><br /><li><b>Any chance you're not paying your taxes at all because you've decided to secede the union and declare your domicile as an independent country?</b><br><br>No, but that's a thought for next year...<br /></ol><br /><br><br>

Even though I've been really busy lately, I did manage to make enough time to get a site update ready.  More Louisiana photos, this time the update consists of two cemeteries, two plantations, an alligator ranch, and a bunch of added stories.  To see the updated pages, <a href="newstuff.html">click here</a> to see the updates page.<br /><br />Oh, I also added info about the new A&E show, <i>Family Plots</i>, on <a href="familyplots.html">this page</a>.  I received a copy of the first episode from their marketing people last Friday, but I still haven't had a chance to watch it (yeah, I lied on the page when I said I had already watched it).  I really hoped to have my friends over to watch it this week, but I just didn't have time to arrange a get together.<br /><br />Around 7:00 this evening I planted some of the herbs in pots out on my patio.  They'll do much better outside than inside now that we have some decent weather...it's supposed to be 78-81F on Sunday!!!  I realize there's always a chance of frost until May 15, but if they end up calling for that I'll just bring all the pots inside.  Hopefully that won't be necessary though.  <br /><br />I can't think of anything else to write about.  So I'll leave you with my answers to the <a href="http://squeeek.com/freak/3xThursday.html" target="_blank">3x Thursday</a> questions:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Which do you prefer, a nice big expensive car, or an economical car that doesn't cost much but gets you where you need to go? Why? What's your dream car?</b><br><br>I don't feel the need to have an expensive car, but I do like big cars.  Pickup trucks to be exact.  Chuck was a lot less than a lot of the big, expensive cars I looked at.  He doesn't have a lot of extra features (I don't have automatic windows, etc) but it has everything I think is necessary.  My Chevy Silverado is my dream car, although it would be cool to have the top of the line model ;)<br><br><br /><li><b>What about money? Is it better to make a lot of money, or have enough to live and be comfortable on? If you had an ideal amount of money to make per year, what would it be?</b><br><br>.  Honestly, when it comes to work I think it's most important to pick a career you enjoy...money shouldn't be the primary thing you look for.

Yeah, yeah...I know.  All I've been posting lately are my answers to the daily memes.  That's what happens when I get busy!  I'll try hard to make time to post a longer entry soon.<br /><br />But for now, here are my answers to the <a href="http://wednesday.fiare.net/" target="_blank">Wednesday Whatevers</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Would you prefer to live in an urban, suburban, or rural area; and why?</b><br><br>I would love to live in a rural area.  I love being out in the country surrounded by fields and forests.<br><br><br /><li><b>If a fountain of youth did exist, would you drink from it?</b><br><br>No, definitely not.  I don't feel the need to stay young, and I certainly don't want to live forever.<br><br><br /><li><b>What do you want your dying words to be?</b><br><br>This may surprise some of you, but I've never thought about this.  I've thought about dying (yeah, I'm morbid), but never about my last words.  I don't think I can answer this question...I think my last words will totally depend on the situation, who's around me, etc.<br /></ol><br><br>

I'm relieved...I though the <a href="http://www.captive-heart.com/TT.html" target="_blank">Tuesday Twosome</a> might not be posted today!  Here are my answers:<br /><br /><b>Taxes:</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>"Eek, I owe" or "Show me the money!" </b><br><br>&quot;Show me the money!&quot; - yes, I got a refund again this year. <br><br><br /><li><b>"Finished already" or "It isn't the 15th yet, so why rush?!"</b><br><br>&quot;Finished already&quot; - I never wait until the last minute to do them...I don't want to hold up my refund :)<br><br><br /><li><b>"Taxes suck" or "I don't mind because some of it goes to social causes"</b><br><br>Hmmm, I guess I'd have to go with &quot;I don't mind because some of it goes to social causes&quot;.  I've voted for tax increases before, it just depends on what the increase is for.  I'm sure my friend Mark will just love that answer, he hates taxes more than anyone I know!<br><br><br /><li><b>"1040EZ" or "How the heck does anybody understand all this crap?"</b><br><br>&quot;1040EZ&quot; since I don't have to worry about a mortgage yet.<br><br><br /><li><b>"Receipts? What are those?" or "I keep everything just in case *knock on wood*"</b><br><br>&quot;I keep everything yet in case&quot;  - better to be safe than sorry!<br /></ol><br />I got distracted last night, thus the promised blog entry was never written.  Maybe I'll get a chance to write a real entry tonight, but I can't promise since I know I'll be busy working on getting the next update ready for the main part of the site.  I'd really like to have the new pages added by the end of the week.<br /><br />Well, time to get back to work...<br><br>

Sorry I didn't get a chance to blog this weekend, I was busy cleaning...and I spent all Friday night flower shopping with my mom!  Anyway, I'll blog all about that tonight (since I'll be more awake then!).<br /><br />So for now, here are my answers to this week's <a href="http://mmadness.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Monday Madness</a>:<br /><br /><b>What color is your favorite.......</b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Vegetable</b><br><br>Green - My favorite veggie is broccoli...I like it steamed, preferably with no cheese or butter.<br><br><br /><li><b>Beverage</b><br><br>Brown - My favorite beverage is tea.   I've been drinking a lot of iced tea lately, and I drink hot tea all the time.<br><br><br /><li><b>Room</b><br><br>White - I guess my favorite room is the computer room, and the walls are white so I went with that as the color.  I have no real color theme in that room...I have a black desk chair, a green futon, and an old turquoise chair.<br><br><br /><li><b>Outfit</b><br><br>Black - Almost all of my clothes are black :)<br><br><br /><li><b>Mood</b><br><br>Black - I don't remember the color translations for each mood, so I went with black since that was the color the mood ring ALWAYS showed for me.<br><br><br /><li><b>Season</b><br><br>Orange - My favorite season is fall.<br><br><br /><li><b>Fruit</b><br><br>Green and Pink - My favorite fruit is watermelon!<br><br><br /><li><b>Dessert</b><br><br>Yellow - Mmmmm, cheesecake!<br><br><br /><li><b>Pair of shoes</b><br><br>Red - I have lots of favorite shoes, but I'd have to say my absolute favorite are my red Doc Martens mary jane's.<br><br><br /><li><b>Color</b><br><br>Black - It's my favorite because it seems to go with almost everything.<br /></ol><br><br>

<a href="http://ed.ki0sk.org" target="_blank">&ecircddi&ecirc</a> is the greatest...since there haven't been any Friday Five questions the past couple weeks, he has started the <a href="http://ki0sk.org/four/" target="_blank">Friday Four</a>!  Here are my answers:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Are you lucky enough to have Good Friday as a work or school holiday?</b><br><br>No, but I wish I did.  Maybe I need to find a state/government job, then I'd get all the holidays off!<br><br><br /><li><b>Are you doing anything related to Good Friday this weekend?</b><br><br>No, just a normal Friday for me.  I'm not even sure I'm doing anything special for Easter!<br><br><br /><li><b>Eat any fish lately?</b><br><br>I haven't had any this week, but I ate fish and seafood just about everyday while I was in New Orleans.<br><br><br /><li><b>Have you gone fishing lately?</b><br><br>I haven't been fishing in years!  I used to fish with my grandma at her pond on the farm.  It was fun, but it could be quite traumatizing too.  See, my grandma hated catfish for some reason.  Whenever one of us would catch one she'd make my sister and I throw it over by the fence to slowly die on land in the hot sun.  Catfish are kind of cute, so my sister and I hated doing that.  We tried to be heroines a couple times and throw the fish back in the water, but she always caught us and made us kill them.  Looking back the whole thing makes me laugh, but I thought it was awful when I was a kid!<br /></ol><br><br>

My answers to this week's <a href="http://squeeek.com/freak/3xThursday.html" target="_blank">3x Thursday</a>:<br /><br /><b>Long Lost Family and Friends </b><br /><ol><br /><li><b>Do you keep in touch with most of your family (internal and external) members? Why/why not?</b><br><br>I keep in touch with my internal family...not only do I see them most weekends, but we all work at the same company!!  I see my mom's side of the family throughout the year, they all live close together.  I don't keep in touch with my dad's family as well, I might get to see them once a year...I'd like to change that.<br><br><br /><li><b>If you've lost touch with some of your family and friends, is it time to call them up and find out how they are, or do you even care?</b><br><br>I do care.  I try to call up lost family and friends occasionally, but I'm more likely to e-mail the ones I have addresses for since I prefer communicating that way.<br><br><br /><li><b>Are you afraid to contact someone that you haven't had communications with in a long time? Do you think they'll be pissed that you haven't called in 5 years? Or do you think, "better late than never"?</b><br><br>Since I'm a pro at worrying, I do get nervous before calling/e-mailing someone I've lost contact with....you just never know how they'll react.  But I do think &quot;better late than never&quot;, and I always end up calling. <br><br><br /><li><b>Bonus Question for Comments: How do you react when someone (friend or family) that you haven't spoken with (for whatever reason) in years contacts you?</b><br><br> I get so excited when I hear from someone I haven't talked to in ages!  It doesn't happen often though, because I'm pretty good at keeping in touch with people.<br /></ol><br><br>

I am loving this warmer weather!  I can't wait until it stays in the 60's - 70's consistently.  I was out on my patio again tonight, looking at all of the perennials coming up in my flower bed.  So far all the perennials I've planted the past two years have continued to come back each year...if only my green thumb worked for my miserable looking houseplants!  But back to the garden - so far I have clematis, vinca vine, honeysuckle, hops vine (can you tell I like climbing plants?!), catmint, lemon balm, sage (which is an annual that has managed to winter over for the third year!!!!), Saint John's wart, showy primrose, roses, lavender, rue, southernwood, cabbage plants (I don't know what they're really called), hollyhocks, spiderwort, mullein, snowcap, hostas (LOTS of them!), ferns, bleeding heart, hyacinth, and a few plants I can't remember the names of.  Looks like I won't have to buy many plants this year, mainly just ones to plant in my thousands of containers.  I've already bought some of them, Dill's had a 99 cent perennial/herb sale right after we got back from New Orleans, my mom and I went to check out the sale last Thursday.  I bought a flat of herbs for the containers - hot and spicy oregano, greek oregano, golden thyme, oregano thyme, lime thyme, African blue basil, spicy globe basil, cinnamon basil, Kentucky Colonel mint, spearmint, mint julep, berggarten sage, garden sage, variegated sage, horehound, french lavender, and pennyroyal.  I also ordered three passion vines (my absolute favorite vine, they have the coolest flowers) and some other hard-to-find plants on the internet that should be shipped at the end of April (if the weather is warm enough).  Actually, the passion vines will be shipped sooner since they can live as a house plant too.  This year I remembered to order my plants early enough, so I was able to purchase belladonna, wolf's bane, and skullcap before they sold out.  I'm so excited.  But I'm sure I've just bored all of you who don't share my passion for gardening!  Just wait til I start posting all the photos... :)<br /><br />Remember when I wrote about wanting to have a ouija party?  I think it'll be sometime next week.  I can't narrow down a date yet.  Want to know why?  Well, I was contacted about promoting A&E's new show called "Family Plots" on my site.  The show is about a funeral home in San Diego, and the first episode will air on 4/19.  Since I agreed to help promote it, they're sending me a copy of the first episode to review...so I thought it'd be fun to combine that with the ouija party, then we can all review it!  I think she mailed the tape today (if not, tomorrow), so I should have it early next week.  I'm hoping to have it by Wednesday, because Wednesday would be a great night to have the ouija gathering.  I'll keep ya posted! <br /><br />Other than that, the only other &quot;exciting&quot; thing I did tonight was wash the truck.  But tires and wheel wells STILL look dirty.  I swear, I don't think I'll EVER get all the mud from this weekend's excursion to the dump cleaned off the truck.  At least the inside looks nice and clean after I swept it out tonight.  Guess that's what really matters!<br><br>

Here are my answers to today's memes!<br /><br />First, the <a href="http://whatsonnow.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">What's On...Right Now</a> answer:<br /><br /><b>What's On <u>your outside thermometer</u> Right Now?</b><br /><br />It's currently around 45F in Columbus, OH right now...the high is 65!  Looks like tomorrow will be another warm spring day, but then it's supposed to drop into the 40's and 50's again :(<br /><br />And next, my answers to the <a href="http://wednesday.fiare.net/" target="_blank">Wednesday Whatevers</a>:<br /><ol><br /><li><b>Would you rather be alone or surrounded by enemies for the rest of your life, and why?</b><br><br>This is a difficult one.  At first I thought I'd rather be alone, but even though I totally like being alone sometimes, I think I'd miss the human interaction.  Even being around enemies would be better than no one at all.<br><br><br /><li><b>Would you choose an eternal but cursed life, or death? Why?</b><br><br>Wow, these are crazy questions this week!  I would have to choose death...while I hope I live to an old age, I don't think I want to live eternally.  And being cursed would make living forever extremely terrible.<br><br><br /><li><b>What 5 websites do you visit first everyday?</b><br><br>The first thing I do is check my e-mail (unless it's a day like today - my e-mail is down and I'm going crazy!!!).  Then I usually visit these sites:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.nbc4columbus.com" target="_blank">NBC4 Columbus</a> (local news)<br /><li><a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com" target="_blank">My homepage</a> (to make sure it's up and running - I have lots of trouble with my current webhost)<br /><li><a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/stats/" target="_blank">My stats</a> (to see how many hits/visits my site had the day before)<br /><li><a href="http://bluethrill.net/blog/" target="_blank">Dave's blog</a> (since it's first on my daily blog reading list)<br /><li><a href="http://ed.ki0sk.org/" target="_blank">Eddie's blog</a> (since it's second on my daily blog reading list).<br /></ul></ol><br><br>

My first day back to work wasn't too bad...I figured it would be terrible to go back after being out for seven days (not including the weekends!).  I'm so glad I was wrong though.  My area moved up a floor last week (I moved my stuff before I left), so today was also my first day at the new desk...I really like it.  The desk is so neat and clean right now, but it'll probably only be a couple days before it's a mess again :)<br /><br />The last few days of my vacation at home weren't so great.  I'm so congested, it's either allergies, a sinus infection, or a cold.  Benadryl seems to help though, so I'm not going to waste my time going to the doctor as long as it clears up within a couple weeks.  Like I told everyone at work today, it's probably just a reaction from coming home to 40-50 degree rainy weather (it was in the 80's and sunny in New Orleans!).  I was having an awful time with losing my voice this morning though.  I sounded pretty bad, but fortunately it got a little better as the day went on.<br /><br />I just remembered that I forgot to blog about my exciting adventure on Saturday.  Thursday (night) and Friday were the worst days for my cold/sinus/allergies.  I was still feeling pretty bad when I woke up on Saturday morning after the maybe two hours of sleep I had, but I told Ryan that Chuck (for those of you who have never heard me refer to the vehicle by name, Chuck is my Chevy truck!) and I would go over to his place to help him haul some old garage doors and miscellaneous junk to the dump.  John came to help us too.  After eating a great breakfast at Canal Winchester's Wigwam restaurant (it's one of those fun hole-in-the-wall type places in downtown Canal), we were back to Ryan's place to load all the junk into the bed of the truck.  There was a ton of stuff to haul away, the bed was filled.  We tied everything down, then it was off the the dump near Grove City.  Now, I had never been to a dump, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But it was WAY worse than I would've ever imagined!  And John and Ryan felt the same so I didn't feel too ignorant :)  We drove up to the booth to pay, but the window in the trailer was really high so I had to jump out of the truck to pay.  That made all of us laugh...but then as we started to drive things got funnier!  John and I assumed there would at least be concrete roads to drive on...but instead it was just a wide, muddy dirt path with big ruts/potholes everywhere, with mountains of trash looming in front of us!  I tried to follow the much bigger Ford truck a little ways in front of me to avoid some of the potholes, but there was really no way to avoid them.  I kept worrying that poor Chuck would get stuck in the mud, but we finally made it to drier ground.  Well, actually &quot;ground&quot; isn't a good word to use...we made it to drier trash.  I was driving on piles of mud and white colored trash - we're guessing it was trash treated with some sort of chemical to help it disintegrate faster?  Honestly, we couldn't tell what it was!  Anyway, I was stopped on the trash pile waiting for the guy in front of me to back up.  I was watching his tires as he was backing up, and I could see how squishy/spongey the ground under him was by the way the tires were sort of bouncing.  He finally finished backing up, then it was our turn.  John and Ryan helped me decide where to stop, they were worried about the truck getting stuck too.  Well, we stopped way in front of the other people, we figured we could just carry the trash back to the piles ourselves.  But before we could even start lifting the trash, the guy driving this big piece of machinery with spikey wheels started honking at us and motioning for us to back up further.  Since he was so persistent in honking, I had to get in, start the truck up, and back it up more.  The guy was probably afraid that we were going to dump it right where we were...but we were really just scared of getting stuck!  Since the three of us didn't feel too comfortable there, we unloaded the bed of the truck at light speed, then we got the hell out of there!  We laughed about our adventure the whole way back to Ryan's house.  Ryan paid for my breakfast, but he said that he owes me a car wash and new shocks after that fun-filled journey :)  Honestly though, I really do need to wash the truck, it's filthy...there's mud caked around the tires.  I can say this much...the dump definitely isn't a place that I'd like to visit again if I can help it! :)  I'm always willing to help out my friends though!<br /><br />So now that I've bored you with this weekend's great adventure, I think I'm going to call it a night! <br><br>
