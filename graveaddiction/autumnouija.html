On February 13, 2006 I received an e-mail from Autumn Bayley about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;One night by best friend, Akasha, came up to me and asked if I would like to make our own Ouija Board.  Of course I said yes, but was scared because my mother doesn't like them; she had a few bad times with them. We went along and made our board and put up a protection circle, called the four quarters, the four elements, and the gods and goddesses of the watchtowers before doing anything. I knew to do this because I am a Wiccan and know that if you're going to be doing anything that has to do with contacting spirits you NEED protection unless you want unwanted/evil guests. So, my friend and I had finished putting up the circle and started our Ouija opening:
<br><br>
Akasha: Ouija, are you there?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Who are we speaking to?<br>
Ouija Board: Zaza.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Zaza...as in the Zaza I've spoken to before?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Zaza, are you a good spirit?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Did you die peacefully?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: How old were you when you died?<br>
Ouija Board: 51.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Is there anyone else who would like to speak with us?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Who?<br>
Ouija Board: Henry.<br>
<br>
Autumn: My great grandfather, Henry Holloway?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Why do you want to talk to me tonight grandpa?<br>
Ouija Board: Meet.<br>
<br>
Akasha: You wanted to meet Autumn?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Are you always here with me?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Protecting me?<br>
Ouija Board: Always.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Can we talk to someone else Henry?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Who?<br>
Ouija Board: Darryl.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Oh my god...Daddy?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: You're dead?!<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Did you die happily?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Are you proud of me Daddy?<br>
Ouija Board: Very.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Did you love my mom?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Why did you leave her?<br>
Ouija Board: Mutual.<br>
<br>
Autumn: So it was Mutual between you and Clara?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Are you always with me?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Did you come here with me when I moved in with Autumn?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Can we talk to someone else now?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Who?<br>
Ouija Board: David.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Dear god!<br>
Akasha: What?<br>
Autumn: My dad!<br>
<br>
--------At this time both Akasha and I were in tears.-----------<br>
<br>
Ouija Board: Amanda.<br><br>

Autumn: Yes?<br>
Ouija Board: Love You.<br>

Autumn: I love you too daddy...<br>
<br>
Akasha: Are you proud of your daughter?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes, Very.<br>
<br>
--------- I laughed. ----------
<br><br>
Autumn: Why did you die?!<br>
Ouija Board: Killed.<br>
<br>
Autumn: How?<br>
Ouija Board: Accident.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Who else wants to talk to us?<br>
Ouija Board: John.<br>
<br>
------- I started to realize that the only non-family members we would be talking to would be Zaza, or so I thought. ---------
<br><br>
Autumn: My mom's dad?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Hello Grandpa!<br>
Ouija Board: Hello Amanda.<br>
<br>
Akasha: So we;re only talking to relatives?<br>
Ouija Board: No.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Who else will we be talking to?<br>
Ouija Board: Atanas.<br>
<br>
-------------I went as white as a sheet. -------------
<br><br>
Akasha: Who is Atanas?<br>
Autumn: My 'brother'<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Are we talking to him now?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: Did you die peacefully?<br>
Ouija Board: No.<br>
<br>
Autumn: How did you die?<br>
Ouija Board: Heart<br>
<br>
Autumn: So the offline on Yahoo was true?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: will you stay with us when we quit?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Will all of you stay?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Autumn: You don't have to...<br>
Ouija Board: Want to.<br>
<br>
Akasha: Alright.<br>
Autumn: Can we quit?<br>
Ouija Board: Yes.
<br><br>
So that is our story. We got to talk to our dead fathers; who we did not know had died, my grandfathers, Atanas, and Zaza. To this day we have felt them in the house, heard them, and I have even seen them. I had known that my two grandfathers had moved with me when I moved from Nanaimo, but I had not expected to find out that my mother's uncle was living with us as well.&quot;
