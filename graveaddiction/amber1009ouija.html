On October 24, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amber about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I've only recently begun experimenting with a Ouija board.  This story is from my second experience using one, and took place on Friday night, October 23, 2009.  My friends, who I'll call J and C, came over.  Around 11:00 PM we began setting up.  We lit three white candles, one for each of us, called forth only positive energies, and started.  The board we were using had the words &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;goodbye,&quot; and the alphabet and numbers 0-9, as well as a cross drawn on it.  The following conversation took about an hour.
<br><br>

<br>
This message of &quot;F-O-D-0&quot; continued for several questions pertaining to any message the spirit would like to give, and when asked what it meant, it would only repeat.<br>
