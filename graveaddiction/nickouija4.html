On April 17, 2006 I received an e-mail from Nick about another interesting ouija board experience he had:
<br><br><br>
I just turned 12 and got an oujia board for my brithday.  I decided to use it alone (which I never do).  It was about 11:00 at night (lights on and tv on) when I decided to use it.  A boy named Burn, who was 13 years old, contacted me.  He died in 2004 when a murderer came into his house and killed his family.  Burn was very mad and wanted revenge.  I said I was sorry that happened to him.  He wanted me to murder the one who killed his family, and I said no.  He said if I did not murder him, he (Burn) would hurt me.  Right then I said goodbye; it was 12:00 then so I went to bed.
<br><br>
I woke up at 3:00 AM when I heard a sound like banging in my basement.  I ignored it and went back to sleep.  Fifteen minutes later I woke up again and it was FREEZING in my room.  I went to check the temperature and it was 73 degrees.  I thought I was going crazy...it was so cold. I go back to bed, then I hear a banging in my closet.  Then a black figure (about as tall as me, maybe a little bit taller) crashes out of the closet, jumping on my bed atacking me.  I punched it in the face...it scratched me on my arm.  I then get my metal bat and slam it in the head.  I just kept hitting the figure with my bat, then it faded away.  There was blood on my carpet.  The next day I tell my parents, and they tell me to throw away my board.  I listened to them. Then one evening I find my board in the basement!!  So I used it and Burn talks to me again.  He said IT ISN'T OVER, so I ripped up the board and threw it in the dumpster.  It returned again in my basement, so I ripped it up again. It never came back.
