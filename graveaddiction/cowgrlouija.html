On April 10, 2005 I received an e-mail from Ashley about her experience with the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Here's an interesting story with my experience with a ouija board. Me, my cousin, Steph and our good friend Brett, went to Brett's house after school one day. His folks weren't home. Brett suggested using the ouija board. Now, he and I had used the ouija board before once, and contacted an eight year old girl, but that was uneventful.  However, Steph had never before experienced, and barely knew what it was. So, we sat in Brett's closet with a candle lit, and spoke to the board.
<br><br>
Brett: Is anybody here with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Brett: Who is this?<br>
Board: MTB<br>
<br>
Me: Are those you initials?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Steph: When did you die?<br>
Board: Valentine 05<br><br>
Brett: As in this year?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Brett: Were you waiting for somebody?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Me: How did you die?<br>
Board: Suicide<br><br>
Me: How did you do it?<br>
Board: Rope<br><br>
Steph: You hung yourself?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Brett: Why?<br>
Board: Stod up<br><br>
Brett: Stood up? You were stood up?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Brett: Is there anything you want to tell us?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
Brett: Do you want to talk more?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
(During this whole thing, the thing was moving so fast we could barely keep our fingers on it, so I am pretty sure nobody was moving it) 
<br><br>
(we moved it to goodbye, and put it away)  
<br><br>
We sat in Brett's room afterwards watching t.v., and the t.v. kept spontaneously switching off, and nobody was near the t.v., and the remote was on the t.v., and our hands were where we could all see them, and the t.v. was appropriately plugged in, and Steph and I finally left, and it stopped.&quot;
