On October 5, 2009 I received an e-mail from Soccer about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Last Saturday night my friend, Irish, and I, Soccer, were playing the Ouija board, and we had some very weird encounters. This is what happened that night.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone that would like to speak to us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Zeply Goodbye.<br>
<br>
Now that started to happen throughout the whole night. I would ask their name, and they would say it and then say goodbye. But what happened later was pretty creepy!
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Taz<br>
<br>
Me: Okay-(I get cut off)<br>
Board: MOM<br>
<br>
Me: Awww, do you miss your mom?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Now Irish and I were looking at each other saying we got a  real weirdo here.<br>
<br>
Me: What's wrong?<br>
Board: your mom<br>
<br>
Me: Whose mom are you?<br>
Board: U<br>
<br>
Me: Are you Irish's mom?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Whose mom are you?<br>
Board: (Starts spelling out my whole name! Even my middle name, which my friend did not know!)<br>
<br>
Me: Okay, how old are you?<br>
Board: 61<br>
<br>
Me: How old was I when I died?<br>
Board: 9<br>
<br>
Me: Aww, thats sad. How did I die?<br>
Board: (spells out Zach)<br>
<br>
Right when I was going to ask who that was, Irish said goodbye and moved the pointer to goodbye. When I went to look at him, he had a real creeped out look on his face. I know that I was definitely creeped out too, but I still wanted to know more. So later on I decided to play again with Irish.
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: Taz Goodbye!<br>
<br>
I looked over at Irish and I knew that he felt that she was angry too. This was a fun and totally creepy night!
