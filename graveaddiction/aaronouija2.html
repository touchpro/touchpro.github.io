On June 22, 2005 I received an e-mail from Aaron Park with another interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;This is one of my experiences I had with the ouija board last year on Halloween night. My friends, Candie, Jacob, Melissa, and a few other kids from my school all got together on Halloween and planned to use the board at my friend Candie's house. Her grandfather had died a few years back in her room, and her and her parents always said
they knew he was still there in the house, saying things would get moved around and that Candie's room would suddenly get cold on different nights.  Anyway, we all gathered in her room after attempting to contact other spirits in the living room with no luck. We all sat in different areas around a small, round glass table with a black velvet cover over top of it. The questions went as follows:
<br><br>
<i>Keep in mind we had no previous luck outside her room</i>
<br><br>
Candie: Is anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
Aaron: Who are we speaking with?<br> 
Board: (moved slowly to R... then stopped)<br><br>
Aaron: Who is this?<br>
Candie: Wait! (speaking to us now) I never told you guys my grandfather's name, did I?<br>
Us: No<br><br>
Candie hands her spot over to Melissa.<br><br>
Melissa: Okay, who is this?<br>
Board:  R-O-N<br><br>
Candie: I think that's him.<br>
Board: Yes, Hi sweetie.<br><br>
Melissa: Will you show us a sign that you are here?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
(Candie has glow in the dark stars all over her ceiling, and she had left the room to get a drink)
<br><br>
Aaron: When Candie comes back in, can you drop one of the stars on her head?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
Melissa: Why?<br>
Board: I love her too much.<br><br>
A star never fell on Candie when she returned, but she was very happy to have heard from her grandfather.  Later that night we actually talked with a young girl who had gotten killed the night before driving down the hill from
Laughlin, Nevada. Crazy stuff!&quot;
