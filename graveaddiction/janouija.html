On March 9, 2007 I received an e-mail from Jan about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
I've got a puzzling situation going on right now. To give you some background before I get started with my situation, I bought the Parker Brothers '72 Mystifying Oracle board at our local Kaybee Toys back when I was 11 yrs old. I'm now 28. My board has been all over the US with me as my constant companion, until recently. I just made another huge move, from Oregon back to New York. I had brought my board with me, packed nicely in it's box inside the case for my expensive plush cheetah print blanket, nice cushy ride for it. Well, we arrived here in NY, no probs then. At first I moved into my sisters house for a temporary place to stay til I got my own place, I found my own place a couple months later and moved in on October 1st, 2006. Again, my board came with me in my move. It's been a few months since I moved in, and at first I knew exactly where my board was. I keep it in my cheetah blanket's clear plastic tote bag to help protect even it's box. Well, oddly enough, my board AND the plastic tote case for my cheetah blanket has mysteriously vanished from my entire house. I've searched every nook and cranny, behind every piece of furniture, in every closet, cabinet and shelf, and under beds and other furniture. It's no where to be found along with my blankets tote. I'm kinda in a bit of a panic. The last time I talked on my board I was 14 years old and during that session, I never closed the board, I completely forgot to because I was interupted by the parents. Well, it's been years since I've touched the board, it's been open all this time, and now the thing has decided to disappear on me when I wanted to find it and close out that age old session, plus I had an urge to try to get ahold of my spirit guide which is still nagging me. Luckily, nothing bad has ever escaped and I've not ever had any activity around throughout the years despite the board being open all that time. Or at least until recently that is. I have the side of my PC off the tower and sitting on the floor at the foot of my bed leaning against my wardrobe. That's where it was when I had left for work that evening, which was back on Tuesday 3/6/07. When I got home the next morning, the side of my PC tower was sitting leaning against the front of my dresser a few feet away. I found that quite odd and it did get my explicit attension! Other than that nothing else strange has happened yet. But my disappearing board bothers me. I've only noticed it gone for a few weeks now and have thoroughly searched this tiny apartment top to bottom with all the lights on with a flashlight ta boot. Do you know of any way possible to get the thing to reappear? Should I just go buy another board? Or should I wait for my board to decide to reappear?
<br><br>
If you have any suggestions I'm definitely open to hearing them from you or any of the site readers. I miss my board!
<br><br><br>
In March 2007 I received the following advice from Diana Sours:
<br><br>
<blockquote><i>I believe Jan should find her board AT ALL COSTS. Do not leave it be whereever it is. With her age old session not being closed out, perhaps it finally found a place where it can wreak havoc. I'm not saying her board is wicked, but you never what spirits or entities could be messing around. She could easily go and get a new board, but either way, she MUST find her other one.</i></blockquote>
<br>
If you have any tips/advice, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send them to me</a> and I'll forward them to Jan.
