On September 20, 2003 my mom and I visited Prospect Place in Trinway, Ohio.  We were there for one of the ghost hunts.  On November 14, 2003 I went on my second Prospect Place ghost hunt, and on March 25, 2006 I went on my third hunt at the mansion.  On May 26, 2007 I attended my fourth ghost hunt at Prospect Place.

<b><u>A very brief history of the building</u>:</b>
<br><br>
Prospect Place was built between 1856 - 1857 by George Willison Adams.  The mansion is 9500 square feet and consists of 27 rooms.  Today it is being restored by George Willison Adams' great-great grandson, George J. Adams.  Prospect Place is listed on both the United States Park Service National Register of Historic Places and the Ohio Underground Railroad Association's list.  For a more detailed history, I recommend visiting the <a href="http://www.gwacenter.org" target="_blank">Official Prospect Place website</a>.  This site is awesome, it contains lots of great information about the mansion and the Adams family.
<br><br>
Prospect Place is supposedly one of the most haunted places in Ohio.  One of the ghosts that is often seen is that of a young lady who died in the late 1800's.  She was very sick with a terrible fever.  One night she wandered down the hall by herself during a party.  She wandered outside on the second floor balcony where she fell over the rail and onto the stone steps below.  Since this happened in the winter the ground was frozen, and therefore they had to wait until the ground thawed before she could be buried.  They supposedly kept her body in the basement, packed in snow to keep it from decomposing.  Today she is seen near the balcony door and in the basement.     
<br><br>
The most haunted areas of Prospect Place are the basement, the ballroom, and the barn.  The basement is haunted by both the girl who fell off the balcony and some of the slaves who stayed in the basement on their way to freedom.  I'm honestly not sure why the ballroom is haunted, but many ghost hunters have experienced quite a few strange things there.  The barn is haunted by seven people who were hanged there.
<br><br>
Another interesting thing about the mansion is one of the rooms in the servant's quarters.  One of the large rooms is painted haint blue...this is the original paint that was on the walls.  According to Appalachian Tradition, painting a door haint blue is supposed to keep evil spirits from entering.  This entire room is painted this color!  It really does make you wonder what the servants were so scared of!
