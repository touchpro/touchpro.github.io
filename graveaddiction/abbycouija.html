On June 30, 2007 I received an e-mail from Abby C. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
On June 29, 2007 I was with my friend Candice, and we were using an ouija board for the first time. We asked silly questions like, &quot;Does my boyfriend cheat on me,&quot; and &quot;Is my best friend a zebra?&quot; Then we asked if the board loved us. It said yes. Then it said &quot;do me.&quot; We were so scared. I shit my pants. Then we asked if there was anything else it wanted to tell me...the spirit said &quot;Yes, you will bleed soon and be in pain.&quot; Then we ran to the bathroom because we were so scared. My stomach really hurt, and so did my friend's. Then we looked and we both had our periods!!! So the spirit was right - we had cramps and our periods!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br><br>
Then we contacted the spirit again, and it said its name was Milldrid Tatenanna. Then, right before we were going to ask how it died, it spelled out &quot;do me.&quot; Then we asked the spirit who it wanted to do, and it said take it off. So I did.  I didn't want to upset the spirit, then I unexpectedly found $50 in my pants. My friend felt something feeling up her right boob, it was a spirit named George. After I peed myself, I ran and ate raisons. At the time, my friend was asking questions like show me your (you know what) which is pretty stupid since a ghost felt her up...then the rasion box choked me. I could see the light when Candice threw the board in the RAGING fire, and the spirit went away.  She saved me. Even though the next day my friend got eaten by a llama. The end.
