On July 28, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amanda J. about another interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This is part 2 of the story I submitted yesterday, of the new spirit from Hell who was communicating with me, Jason, Morgan, and Chelsey.
<br><br>
The next day after our conversation  (in which he refused to tell his name), a few little things happened. I was laying on the couch, and I felt something cold over my lips. Like a dry piece of ice, pressing against my lips. It was the oddest feeling. I rubbed my lips wondering what it was, and felt the same feeling on my thigh. And then again on my shoulder. It was as if someone invisible and cold was kissing me. A few minutes later, Jason heard a knocking on the wall behind us. Three strong knocks in a row. Then again later, I was fixing my hair in the mirror, and I heard a growl that I thought was at first kids playing outside. Jason and I were alone that night and decided to try and contact our friendly ghost Tom who lives in our house. Here's how it went:
<br><br>
Me: Is there anyone here who wants to talk with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is this you, Tom?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How are you?<br>
Board: Good<br>
<br>
Me: Is there anything you want to say? We haven't talked for a little while.<br>
Board: Be careful who you invite into your house<br>
<br>
Me: We are careful. We ask for spirits that mean us no harm.<br>
Board: He still got in<br>
<br>
Me: Who? That guy from yesterday?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is he evil?<br>
Board: (moved between Yes and No)<br>
<br>
Me: Maybe?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who was touching me earlier?<br>
Board: him<br>
<br>
Me: Why did he do that?<br>
Board: Bad<br>
<br>
Me: Is he here now?<br>
Board: (moved between Yes and No)<br>
<br>
Me: Why wouldn't he tell us his name?<br>
Board: You cant say it out loud<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: He will get tortured<br>
<br>
Me: What is his name?<br>
Board: Leo<br>
<br>
Me: Satan tortures him?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: No wonder he didn't want to tell us. Did he do anything else?<br>
Board: knock<br>
<br>
Me: Did he growl too?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jason: Do you have any advice for me? I want to see you like Amanda did.<br>
Board: Open your mind.<br>
<br>
Me: How does he do that?<br>
Board: Believe<br>
<br>
Me: He does believe.<br>
Board: He can see us<br>
<br>
Jason: Do I need to try harder to see you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jason: Where do I look?<br>
Board: We stand in front of you<br>
<br>
Me: Can I see you too if I try harder?<br>
Board: he has a different connection<br>
<br>
Me: Do I have any gifts?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What?
Board: An open heart<br>
<br>
(Jason felt something really cold next to him, from what he says)<br>
Jason: I think I feel him. He's right next to me here. Right here!<br>
<br>
Board: (really quickly) Goodbye<br>
<br>
Me: Wait don't go Tom! Why did you leave?<br>
Board: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: Tom, is something happening?<br>
Board: (no movement)<br>
<br>
Me: Is he here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We put the board away and went to bed. Leo didn't do anything HARMFUL to us, but Tom's warning does have me a little shaken. Thanks for letting me share.
