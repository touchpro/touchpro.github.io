On August 17, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kelly about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
This story involves Kelly, Bria (written by), and Maria.  We are all really good friends, and have had two ouija board experiences with each other.
<br><br>
The first was months ago at a birthday party with maybe 4 or 5 people. It being the first time and with us having some people who weren't willing or into it much, it didn't turn out too well. As expected, we conversed with a spirit and it turned out different than expected. The spirit we spoke with (it seemed to be the same one) answered our questions and was very patient for the most part. Until something happened. I'm not sure about what it was exactly, it may of been loud laughing at my friends singing or something we just don't understand. Well, so all of a sudden from this seemingly kind spirit, we started getting threats about haunting the room and attacking us. We immediately said goodbye. It might not of been done properly, but the board was given away and the room sprinkled with holy water, just for a safety precaution. Then afterwards as everyone freaked out me (Bria) and my friend Kelly tried over and over again to explain what we know about ghosts and why the others shouldn't have been scared, since we are very interested in paranormal activity and have been for as long as we can remember. I'm not sure how well it worked but that spirit never did anything to us.
<br><br>
The second time we used the ouija board was much more recent. It was actually a day or so after we first came upon this website. We decided to make our own ouija boards and try them out both for fun and fascination. Since Kelly's was finished first, around 2 in the morning, we took it upstairs to try it out. Since Maria was unsure about using a ouija board again, we read the majority of the tips you have. We actually used quite a few of them too. The ones like lighting a white candle, saying a prayer before and after using the ouija board, and flipping the board and the planchette over worked out for us and soothed any fears we might have had. This particular session began around 3 A.M. and ended around 5:30 A.M. We said the protection prayer we found on your site together, and afterwards we all felt very at peace. Then we started to make contact. The spirits were very interesting to talk to and very humorous, as one might imagine, and we found out and felt quite a few things. We asked a lot of the normal questions, like how did you die, what's your name, and when did you die. We got back names such as M. S. Vsea, W. S. Wuote, Mao, Mack, and C. J. Waes. Some of the deaths they described included explosives in a 1920's Phantom and a murder due to an overdose of glycerin while in the hospital. One spirit spoke of an old college in Ohio by the initials AQS, and a supposedly no longer existent hospital called OSRS Hospital in a supposedly no longer existent town of Merls, Minnesota.
<br><br>
We asked about these spirits' lives and about ourselves even, after all we got curious. We talked about our past lives and spirit guides and the rules of ouija. From what we were told, the number of spirit guides you have is the same amount of past lives you have, that maybe spirits can only follow you from a house or cemetery (not a street or car), that the homemade ouija board only worked when the person who was making it used it also, and some tips you had were told to be false or true. One tip on your website that was claimed as false by the spirits we spoke with was that if you burn a ouija board, the one who hears it scream will die in 36 hours. The only reason these spirits had for not burning a ouija board is that you might release evil spirits trapped inside it. The spirits also told us that a particular story on your site that was submitted was not true. Some tips of yours that were said to be true by these spirits were about the white candle, the prayers, that you should always be polite to the spirits, that it is best to prevent any words that could be categorized as evil from being spelled out, that evil spirits will come if you use a ouija board alone, and more that I can't recall. We asked questions about our futures and pasts that may be turn out to be true, but no one can ever really know for sure.
<br><br>
We did have a few interactions with the spirits too. We asked one to blow on one our fingers, at which point we received a cool breeze on our hands, and Kelly and I felt a tingling and coolness on our feet which the board claimed to be causing. That was most surprising to me because in the beginning my foot was mostly covered with a blanket and the sensation went up to the middle of my calf muscle. The spirits were all considerably kind and appealed to Kelly the most for they said she was the creator of the board, the one who lives in the house, and the strongest believer of the paranormal. One other thing that was, well... attention grabbing, was that the board could spell out people's names, gaming account names and what role they play in your life (brother, boyfriend, mother, etc.). The spirits also told me at one point that my mother was the one who they thought to be the cause of me having a weaker belief in the paranormal than I thought I had. In the end, we got a lot of answers and we all felt great and at ease.
