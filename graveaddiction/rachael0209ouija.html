On February 19, 2009 I received an e-mail from Rachael M. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

One night, me and a few of my friends decided we wanted to have a seance (so I guess technically this isn't an ouija board experience, even though we did use an ouija board like set up) at my friend Fidget's house (using nicknames and/or changing names at the request of friends).  So we all get together, and we have little pieces of paper that would represent the different parts of an ouija board. Because we didn't have a planchette, we used a cell phone. It was me and five others (Berry, Tiger, Fidget, Mir, and Em). Ohhh yeah. Me, Tiger, and Mir are all different levels of psychic, by the way. I'm a medium, Tiger sees auras, and the planchette wouldn't move without Mir touching it. So here's what happened.
<br><br>
Tiger: Is there anyone with us tonight?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Tiger: What's your name?<br>
Board: Colin<br>
<br>
Tiger: Do you know Deb? (ghost met during previous seance with Tiger, Mir, and Em)<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Tiger: How do you know Deb?<br>
Board: no movement<br>
<br>
Tiger, Mir, and Em: How do you know Deb?<br>
Board: Boyfriend<br>
<br>
Mir: You were her boyfriend?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
We all remove our hands from the cell phone being used as a planchette.<br>
<br>
Em and Mir: Guys, this is serioulsy freaking us out.<br>
Fidget: Just relax. Its not like anything seriously bad is going to happen.<br>
Me: Um...Fidget? You don't know that...<br>
Tiger: Yeah, guys, maybe we should stop...<br>
Fidget: Tiger! This was your idea!<br>
Tiger: Yeah, I know, but Lilith was right when she said that we don't know everything's going to be all good. And I mean, I don't know...I have a bad feeling about this...<br>
Fidget: Fine, we'll stop.<br>
<br>
We put everything away, and we all go home. Later that night, on IM...<br>
<br>
Tiger: That crap at Fidget's house was weird, huh?<br>
Me: Yeah, it was. God I hate doing that stuff. Why'd we do it, anyway?<br>
Tiger: idk. It was the weirdest thing ever.<br>
Me: Yeah, I know.<br>
Me: Hey Tiger? Can I tell you something that I've never told anyone before?<br>
Tiger: Yeah, of course.<br>
Me: Can you be open minded?<br>
Tiger: Most likely, yeah.<br>
Me: ...I'm...a...<br>
Me: I see ghosties.<br>
Tiger: ...SERIOUSLY!!?!?!?!??!<br>
Me: Um...yeah<br>
Tiger: Oh my God! That awesome, because I like, sense them!<br>
Me: ...woah<br>
<br>
After an extended conversation about ghosties, what happened at Fidget's house, and how the planchette would only move when Mir was touching it, we kinda got to know each other a little better. Now,  because of the whole ghostie thing, I am a very religious person. So I had a rosary around my neck all night. Then later, after the ghostie conversation, I went to take a shower. Of course, I took my rosary off and I proceeded to put it on my bed. When I came out of the shower, the rosary was still on my bed. However, the lower part that had the crucifix attached to it had snapped off. That night I had a sense of about three ghosties attached to me, two weak and one very strong. The two weak ones either left or moved on, but the strong one hasn't left me along since.
