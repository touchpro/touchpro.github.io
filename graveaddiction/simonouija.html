On November 7, 2005 I received an e-mail from Simon Dodd about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I recently returned from the States visiting friends (I'm from England). The mother of the family is all into the paranormal things etc...All of which have never really interested me as I would have then believed them to all be just made up. However, this trip was different. She was convinced she had to persuade me otherwise, so she took me to see her psychic friend.  It didn't really prove anything to me, as the things she told me she could have deranged from the earlier things I had told her and whatnot.  
Anyway it went from the psychic, to tarot cards, to rune stones, and a crystal pendulum.  Now the pendulum had me interested as
it seemed to get nearly all the questions right. I'd ask it for the ages of my friends that the family I was with wouldn't know, by asking say, &quot;Is Fred 21?&quot;, and it would go to no and I'd ask other ages until finally his right one.  It was right, amongst other things. Anyway, after this she told me about Ouija Boards.  To be honest, the only real time I'd seen one was in one of the Bill and Ted films :P.  
<br><br>
Anyway, I said we'd do one.  We waited a few nights, the the night came where four of us would be doing it.  We sat down, it all looked a bit weird.  Some prayer type things were said, and then they began asking questions. I had my hand on the planchette.  So they started asking if there were any spirits there with us,  and there was a &quot;yes&quot;.  It then spelled out my name, which I thought to be just them messing with me. Carolyn then asked who it was, and it spelled &quot;Wallace.&quot;  At this point I didn't say anything, and I didn't mention that was the name of my grandfather. She asked me if I knew a wallace, and I just shrugged. She then asked if he was a relation to me. It replied &quot;yes.&quot; Then she asked what relation, and you guessed it, the board spelled &quot;Grandad.&quot; With this I was trying to think how they could know my grandfather's name, but they just couldn't. I mean we were close and all, but I had never mentioned my grandad before, other than how cool he was and what he did in the war etc. Anyway, she asked the spirit what it wanted to say to me. &quot;Sorry&quot; was the reply.  She then asked what he was sorry for, and the reply was &quot;Car.&quot;  This meant nothing to me, I didnt know what it could mean, if anything, or if they were just playing a joke on me. It then moved and spelled out &quot;Action Man.&quot;  With that I froze, I mean literally froze! My mouth opened, and I was in shock. Nobody could have known about the Action Man car, other than me and grandad. I couldn't talk,
and they all knew something was up. I said I wanted to go, so they said I was leaving and told me to say goodbye. I left the room, and as I opened the door the heat rushed in. I was cold, and the room we were in was cold, but the heating was on all over the house. I walked right up into my room, and not very manly of me I know, I burst into tears. I think I was in shock. I sat there for about 10 minutes just crying, and then I fell asleep. The next morning Carolyn told me that after I left my Grandad was still there, and just spelled the word &quot;Proud&quot;.  There was no further movement, or anything that night. I then explained to her that my grandad was sick, and the day before he died, three days after his 50th wedding anniversary with my granny, he promised me that when he was better he was going to get me an Action Man car for the Action Man he had bought me just a few days earlier...but not to tell anyone because my sisters would get jealous as I'd just gotten the Action Man.  He died the next day, and obviously wasn't able to get me the Action Man car.
<br><br>
There you have it...I'm now pretty sure those things can work, even though I was only there for minutes. I was so shocked, and I don't know..Emotional? I'm now convinced,  and when I gather up the courage to try it again I'll try to tell my grandad that it's ok about the car :) Also that I'll see him again, as I now know I probably will.&quot;
