On August 25, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amanda J. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Jason and I have continued to play with our board and talk to Tom, but wanted someone friendly and new to come talk to us. We drew a new board, lit candles, sat some protective stones around us, and started.
<br><br>
Me: We wish to invite all spirits into our home that mean us absolutely no harm. If you want to talk to us please feel welcome. We aren't here to harm you, we want to talk to you. Is anyone here?<br>
Board: (after a few minutes) Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Who is this?<br>
Board: Max<br>
<br>
Me: Hi Max! Do you have something you want to say to us?<br>
Board: Love is eternal<br>
<br>
Me: Yes it is. Anything else?<br>
Board: You have a lovely home<br>
<br>
Me: haha thanks! How old are you Max?<br>
Board: 53<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know Tom?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: We love him, you be nice to him, ok?<br>
Board: Yes he is nice<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know Leo?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is he evil?<br>
Board: Maybe<br>
<br>
Me: Why does he always hang around here when we tell him to leave?<br>
Board: Because you talk<br>
<br>
Me: Do you talk to people through boards often?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What's your last name, Max?<br>
Board: Max Benedict<br>
<br>
Me: How did you die, Max Benedict?<br>
Board: I got sick<br>
<br>
Me: What year?<br>
Board: 1425<br>
<br>
Me: 1425?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Have you been alive since then?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How many lives have you had?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Me: How many have I had?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Jason: How many have I had?<br>
Board: 5<br>
<br>
Me: What do you think of our cats running all over the place?<br>
Board: They are nice<br>
<br>
Me: Did you have cats when you were alive?<br>
Board: Yes 3<br>
<br>
Me: We love our cats! Did Jason and I know each other in any other lives?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What year was it?<br>
Board: many<br>
<br>
Me: Many years?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: When was the last time we knew each other before this life?<br>
Board: 1856<br>
<br>
Me: How did we know each other?<br>
Board: married many times<br>
<br>
Me: How many times?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Me: We were married 4 times?!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: When did I die last?<br>
Board: 1856<br>
<br>
Me: When did Jason die last?<br>
Board: 1857<br>
<br>
Me: Did you have a wife?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is she with you?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why not?<br>
Board: not soul mates<br>
<br>
Me: Are Jason and I soul mates?<br>
Board: Yes Love is eternal<br>
<br>
Me: Why do you keep saying that?<br>
Board: You have loved each other 1927 years<br>
<br>
Me: So, is it kind of like, we are destined to find each other in every life we have?<br>
Board: Yes Yes Yes<br>
<br>
Me: WOW<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What were our names in the 1800's?<br>
Board: Beth and John<br>
<br>
Me: Was I Beth or John?<br>
Board: Beth<br>
<br>
Me: Should we have kids?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: When?<br>
Board: after wedding<br>
<br>
Me: What do you think we should name our first baby?<br>
Board: Macey (that's my favorite girl's name)<br>
<br>
Me: How did you know I like that name?<br>
Board: Tom told me<br>
<br>
Me: I like you Max. I get a really peaceful sense and feeling when we're talking to you.<br>
Board: Thank you<br>
<br>
Me: Will you come back and talk with us again sometime?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, you just let us know whenever you want to talk.<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you do that? Like move something or say something, or give us a sign you're around?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How about we have a code word, and you say it or write it to one of us when you want us to talk to you??<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: You can pick the word. Anything you want<br>
Board: (after a minute or two) Now<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Now&quot;, is that the code word?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok. Awesome. We're going to say goodbye for now, Max. Don't be a stranger.<br>
Board: I won't Goodbye<br>
<br>

I can't really explain the feeling I had talking with &quot;Max,&quot; but I just had an extreme calming, peaceful feeling, almost like a high. I've never talked to a spirit that gave me this feeling. Jason said the same thing. I don't know if he was making things up or not, but everything he was saying made me extremely happy. If anyone has any comments or advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

<br><br><br>
If you have any comments or advice for Amanda, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will send it on to her.
