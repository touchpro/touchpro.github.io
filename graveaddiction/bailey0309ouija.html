On March 31, 2009 I received an e-mail from Bailey about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Bailey, and I'm 15. My two best friends and I have been using the ouija board pretty frequently for about 2-3 months. At first we were scared, so we didn't use it very much.  However, now that we have gotten over our fears, we use it almost every weekend we are together. We always use it at night, and we barely ever talk to ghosts from heaven; they are almost always from hell. Our board is homemade, and at first it was just to try it to see if it really worked. When it did, we wern't sure if someone else was doing it or it was real. The very first time we were shaking violently and crying our eyes out. Our friend died when we were in 7th grade. We talked to him, and he was one of the few in heaven. We knew enough to not be stupid and completly believe any spirits, but we made him prove it and he did. I also talked to my grandmother who died when I was 6.
<br><br>
But that's not why I'm e-mailing you.  Lately we encountered a spirit from heaven. A 16 year old girl who died in February this year, and she said she died in Chicago from a drive-by. She and her baby sister are in heaven. We asked her if she would be willing to make a noise on the closet, because that is where she said she was. She did. We all heard it. She said she had no intention of hurting us, and she even asked if we were friends.  We said sure of course, not wanting to be rude. But then we asked if she would say something for us. She agreed of course, and she said hi. When she said it, it sounded right next to mine and my friend's head.  It sounded like &quot;hhhiiii,&quot; very breathy. We all heard it, and were amazed.  Then we asked if she would say my name, and she said yes. My friend (the one whose head the noise was between) said that she heard it, but I didn't. My friend told me to listen. Then she gasped. Natalia had said my name 3 times, and I never heard any of them. We asked her to say pillow. She said it like &quot;pilllooooowww,&quot; and it was loud. I asked if she was shouting at us, and she said yes. Then I had a strange urge to go to the bathroom.  Really bad, and not wanting to go alone, my friends came with me. We asked Natalia to wait, and she said ok.
<br><br>
When we came back, we started talking and at first it didn't say anything.  We were thinking she left, so we kept asking if anyone was there.  Finally it answered, but the way it was talking didn't sound like Natalia. It was another ghost, but one from hell that we had talked to a couple weekends before; there were 5 of us then. My friend had gone to get incense, just in case after we found out it was a girl.  I guess girls are never good to talk to?  We were trying to say goodbye, but she kept going to no.  We were getting a little scared, and finally I asked her what she wanted.  She spelled out life. We all got really freaked out, and my friend came back in with burning incense and told us to say God's Prayer.  So we did, over and over again. Maybe 10-15 times. We were scared to stop. And finally it went to goodbye.
<br><br>
The other night Christine came back and said she wanted the same thing. Life. My friend got the incense and had it ready, but didn't burn it yet. We were hoping we could just talk to her and try to change her mind to not hurt us as she said she was going to. In the middle of talking to her, my friend was like &quot;wtf!?&quot; I asked her what and she said, and she felt a strange sensation almost like a tickle or something on her ear.  I asked her if she was doing it, and she said yes. I told her to stop, and my friend was like don't make her mad its ok, I'm fine. So we kept talking to her.  Then my friend said it was on her jaw, almost on her throat. I told Christine not to hurt Caitlan. And then my other friend, Tiffany, asked if I had any tylenol or ibprofen. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me she had a splitting headache. It was so bad she started crying. Caitlan and I both knew what was going on. It had happened to Caitlan before, but that time we were safe because the guy promised he wouldn't hurt her and would stop when I told him to. Besides, she asked for it that time. I asked too, but he said I was too weak. That made me mad. But we thought that was being possessed, but reading your website I found out that she wasn't. She was being inhabited. Caitlan said that she saw things in her head, almost like memories.  I asked Tiffany if she was seeing anything. She was in so much pain she couldn't answer. Immediately, Caitlan lit the incense and I started praying with my hand on her head. She said whenever I prayed, her headache got worse.  She told me to stop, but I knew that I couldn't stop. Caitlan also got a silver cross necklace, and put it on Tiffany and started waving the incense over Tiffany's head and around the room.
<br><br>
Eventually it went away, and she told us that she saw an old woman staring at her. When I asked if the woman looked angry, she said she wasn't really angry but she was definitely not happy. Christine stayed though, and Tiffany said she has the same sensation Caitlan had on her ear, but on her toe that was sticking out from under the blanket. It happened to be next to me, so I whacked her toe and told Christine: &quot;STOP AND GO AWAY!!&quot; Then Caitlan yelled at me for yelling at a ghost and possibly making it madder than it already was. So I asked if I had hit her hands away. She said yes, and I laughed at her in almost a taunting way to show her that I wasn't scared. Tiffany said it was happening again, so I started lashing out around her feet. When I stopped, I asked again if I had hit her.  She said no, but it hesitated a little and went slow so I think I did and she just didn't want to admit it. So I was like &quot;GOODBYE!!!&quot; It went to goodbye REALLY fast.
<br><br>
The the next day I went home, and that night they did it themselves. Tiffany told me as soon as it said hello, it went straight to spelling &quot;Where's Bailey?&quot; They asked who it was, and it was Christine.
<br><br>
This may mean nothing to you, and you may think I'm some stupid little kid that shouldn't be messing with a ouija board.  But I just need to know if you think because of what I did, will I be in any harm or anything like that? I'm sorry this is so long :) If you can help though, it would be much appreciated.

<br><br><br>

If you have any advice/comments for Bailey, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I will forward it on to her.
