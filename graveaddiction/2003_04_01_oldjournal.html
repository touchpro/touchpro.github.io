This weekend I went down to Point Pleasant, WV and took lots of pictures at the TNT Area and at the abandoned Lakin State Hospital.  Here are the links to the pages with the new photos on Grave Addiction:<br /><br />TNT Area - <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/tnt2.html" target="blank">http://www.graveaddiction.com/tnt2.html</a><br />Lakin Hospital - <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/lakinam.html" target="blank">http://www.graveaddiction.com/lakinam.html</a><br /><br />I still have seven more pages to add to that site, hopefully I'll get a chance to do that tomorrow night.<br /><br />Last Wednesday night I met one of Chrissie's friends from Newark, OH at a get together at Chrissie's place.  She, Stefanie, works at one of the libraries there, and she was looking for someone to talk about ghosts for the summer reading program.  So guess who's going to do that...you guessed it, me!!  <br /><br />Anyway, I need to get back to work, but I'll try to blog more tonight!<br><br>

I haven't posted these for a month or two...<br /><br />My top referrals for the past two weeks:<br /><ol><br /><li>"Inside Lakin Hospital" - they should probably see my <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/lakin.html" target="blank">Lakin State Hospital</a> page on Grave Addiction.  There were quite a few variations of this search as well, like "Inside Lakin Hospital", "Lakin State Hospital Point Pleasant West Virginia", "Ghost Stories About Lakin", etc. <br><br><br /><li>"How to Cure Tapeworms" - I can't believe people are still finding my site looking for this...it has been months since Kitty and I had the tapeworm discussion at work! <br><br><br /><li>"Crack TestDirector" - no helpful hints on cracking TestDirector on my site.  I just use this tool at work, I've never tried to "crack" it!<br><br><br /><li>"Female Sock Fetishes" - this one made me laugh!  I certainly don't have a female sock fetish...in fact I've never met anyone who has!<br><br><br /><li>"Foot Cramps and Chips" - wonder if they were trying to find out if eating chips causes foot cramps?  Sorry, I just get foot cramps and blog about them, I don't know much about what causes them.<br><br><br /><li>"Frog Flower Pot" - bet this person was looking to buy a frog flower pot, but instead he/she found my site and got to read about the "Miracle Frog...the weeping frog flower pot of the fifth floor!<br><br><br /><li>"Weather Wive's Tales" - the only time I remember writing about old wive's tales was when I blogged about the tapeworm cures.<br><br><br /><li>"Beth's Journal" - wonder if I was the Beth they were looking for?<br><br><br /><li>"Lots of Mudvayne Fan Art" - none of that here, but I do like Mudvayne!<br><br><br /><li>"Soap Foot Cramp" - hmmmm, were they looking for soap shaped like a foot cramp?!  Just kidding, my guess is that they were looking for foot cramp cures or causes.<br><br><br /><li>"Frogs" - this is the best...someone did a search <i>using my site's search engine</i> to search for "frogs" on my site!  Since the main focus of my site is frogs, this returned 111 matches, including this blog.<br><br><br /><li>"Pictures of German Sheppard Mixes" - I've never blogged about her, but my family did have an Australian Sheppard/German Sheppard mix when I was a kid.  Her name was Tillie.<br><br><br /><li>"Lancaster Ohio Haunted House on Mud House Road" - won't find pictures of Mudhouse Mansion here, but you can see some on Forgotten Ohio's <a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com/mudhouse.html" target="blank">Mudhouse Mansion</a> page.<br><br><br /><li>"Sounds of the Dumpy Tree Frog" - I don't have any sound files on my site, and I never call my White's tree frogs Dumpy tree frogs, even though that is a common name for them.<br /></ol><br><br>

Another fun and exciting week at work.  So far this week is a little better than last, but not that much better!  Maybe it's the colder weather that's causing me to feel a bit down.<br /><br />Anyway, this past weekend was the Civil War Encampment at <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/smeck.html" target="blank">the park</a> near my parents' house.  It was quite interesting.  But it seems a little funny to me when I think that these people get so serious about pretending to be Civil War soldiers...they camped out in tents during a thunderstorm!!  Of course, some probably think that my <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/cemindex.html" target="blank">cemetery addiction</a> is strange too.  Oh, and don't forget my frog obsession...I know people think that's stange!  But back to the Civil War...they had muskets and three cannons that they fired for the artillery demos, which really made my parents' dogs bark LOTS!  I took some pictures, I'll be posting them on <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com" target="blank">Grave Addiction</a> within the next few days.  Also, Jason and Misty from the Ohio Exploration Society came down and they took some pictures as well.<br /><br />Speaking of Grave Addiction, I made some major updates to the site last night.  You can see the list of updates <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/newstuff.html" target="blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Mark and I will be going to Point Pleasant, WV for a short trip this weekend to take some more pictures of the <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/tnt.html" target="blank">TNT Area</a> for the Mothman section of Grave Addiction.   We're also going to visit the <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/lakin.html" target="blank">Lakin Psychiatric Hospital</a> that Jeremy told me about and the Tyn Rhos Cemetery that Mark said is really creepy.  I can't wait!  So far it looks like the weather is going to be decent so we should have a good time exploring.<br /><br />No more significant hauntings in my apartment to talk about.  The other night all of my remote controls (5 total) were arranged in a circle in the middle of my living room.  And as usual, the "normal" stuff...the candleholders moving, the Ouija board moving, etc.  I've been seeing a lot of shadows recently though, and the cold spots around the apartment (that move) have been more noticeable.<br /><br />In a few weeks I'm volunteering with a cemetery clean-up project.   There's an old cemetery in Upper Arlington, Bickett-Richards, that's in really bad shape.  The county has decided to clean it up.  I'm going to help with gardening tasks, like planting bulbs/plants and mulching.  I think it'll be fun...I love volunteering and I love cemeteries so this is the perfect combination!  I stopped by the cemetery tonight (which is kind of hard to find if you don't know exactly where to look) and took some "before" pictures.  I'll be adding them to Grave Addiction soon.  I also want to take some "after" pictures for the site too.<br><br>

Is this week <i>ever</i> going to end????<br /><br />Obviously, it hasn't been a great week.  I'm OK when I'm at home, but at work I've been a little down lately.  But doesn't everyone have weeks like that?  I've noticed my coworkers having "bad" weeks before, but for some reason I guess it's not OK for me to have a bad week.  Lots of people have been asking "are you OK, you haven't been as talkative as usual", "are you in a bad mood, you don't seem as perky as usual", etc.  And on Monday my manager actually asked me to stay after a meeting, just to ask if I was doing OK, someone told him that I seemed depressed last Friday (he was out so I guess someone felt it was necessary to inform him)!  I wonder if everyone gets these questions when they're having a bad week?  It's starting to annoy me, which most definitely isn't helping me feel more "perky" or talkative.  I'm just a bit overloaded with project assignments right now, maybe once some of them are wrapped up I'll feel better.<br /><br />The other thing at work that absolutely drove me CRAZY this week was the never ending report.  On Sunday a few of us were in to work on some Statement issues.  Deidee needed to print out a report, but she accidentally printed the wrong one.  The report she accidentally printed was about 150,000 lines!!!  Since we printed it from the SAR application it didn't show up in the task bar on her computer, usually we can stop these jobs from printing by hitting the "cancel print" button on the printer.  It appeared that this solution worked until about an hour later when the report mysteriously started printing again, from the beginning even!  We called tons of people, even our Data Center, and no one could help us!  It was kinda funny on Sunday.  However, it started to print again on Monday.  That's when everyone started complaining about how much paper was being wasted, etc.  And we still couldn't find anyone to help us with getting the report from hell to stop printing!  Then this morning I heard someone complaining at the printer and I got a sick feeling in my stomach...yes, it was the dreaded report.  It started to print a few more times today, but by 11:00 I got ahold of someone who was able to stop it from printing!!!  So at least now that nightmare is over!<br /><br />Since I think a few of my coworkers do read this occasionally I better stop complaining about work related stuff :)  Let's move on, shall we...<br /><br />OK, first let me tell you that I'll understand if you call me a dumbass and tell me that I deserve everything that's happened.  Now that I've said that, I'll tell you about my most recent ghost related experiences.  Two years ago I saw two pieces of a broken tombstone in my great uncle's yard...now part of a park.  The piece with the name is missing, the only info I know is that the person died in 1867, and I can make part of an age.  As far as we know there was not a cemetery on the property.  Turns out that the park wasn't going to keep the tombstone since they had no idea where it came from, they were just going to throw it away.  So I decided to bring it home this weekend, it'll look nice in my garden.  I got home late on Saturday, and I was feeling too tired and lazy to put the tombstone pieces outside in the garden so I just sat it on my table in the living room.  Other than feeling intense cold spots throughout the apartment (even though I turned the furnace up to 68 degrees!), nothing strange happened.  Sunday I spent most of my day at work.  I got home around 5 PM, so it was still light outside.  When I walked into my apartment the first thing that I noticed was that the living room seemed really bright!  I knew I left the patio blinds shut that morning, so I wasn't sure why the room was so bright.  Then I saw that the blinds were all formed into "X" patterns!  I do have a heating vent over there, but all that has ever done was make the bottoms of the blinds shake a little.  Also, the vent wouldn't cause the blinds to be moved into the "X" patterns!  In addition to the blinds, a few things had been moved around, like candleholders, the Ouija board planchette...you know, the "normal" stuff!<br /><br />I know what you're thinking - did I put the tombstone outside after the blind incident?  No, I ate some dinner and went to bed because work wore me out.  I woke up Monday morning and everything was fine, nothing had been moved.  However, when I came home from work Monday afternoon everything wasn't normal!  I have a bad habit of kicking off my shoes by the front door and leaving them there, so unless I'm expecting company there's always a pile of shoes near my front door.  Well, Monday afternoon the five pairs of shoes that were laying by the door had been moved.  All ten shoes were lined up single file from the edge of my living room towards the patio door.  I saw it as a sign - the tombstone wanted to be outside!  I didn't waste anytime, I found a place for it in my garden and it was outside within half an hour after I arrived home!  <br /><br />Tonight nothing too strange happened.  Just the "normal" stuff!<br /><br />By the way, I think I forgot to post this last week...I put the list of questions and answers from the last Ouija board party out on Grave Addiction.  We used the board for about an hour and thirty-three minutes and had a lot of interesting stuff come out...<a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/ouija032003.html">CLICK HERE</a> to read about it!<br><br>
