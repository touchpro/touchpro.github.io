On August 29, 2008 I received an e-mail from Lauren about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have been using ouija boards for some time now, and I have always had fun with them.  Like asking stupid questions about our future, and the spirits giving us stupid answers, and us just laughing and joking around.  Tonight started out much the same, but ended so different.
<br><br>
It was me (Lauren), Alli (my best friend), and Matt (my boyfriend).   We were down in the basement with a paper ouija board and two candles.  The lights were off, and all the windows were covered with pillows so it was almost pitch black, except for the candles.
<br><br>
I can't remember exactly what was said, but we talked to a few people we are familiar with, including Ben and Lyle.  They both have huge crushes on Alli and I.  We also talked to Cherry Vine, a drag queen who showed a love interest in Matt.
<br><br>
After a while I said that I wanted to do something scary, and I decided we should talk to someone new.
<br><br>
We asked for someone new, and got Carol.  She is a 17 year old spirit who said she jumped off a cliff when something tragic happened with her boyfriend.  She kept saying that I had an amazing aura, and that I had really good energy.  She also said that I was the best ouija board person she had ever done it with before.  We talked for awhile, and then we asked if she had any questions for us.  She started spelling out my name again and again and again.  I was like what?  Then she said you die.  Then we said goodbye.
<br><br>
We tried again, and it was still her.  She kept saying all this scary stuff, and said she was a lesbian and was going to rape me.  I asked when, and she spelled out all alone tonight.  Well, that got me freaked out, and even though Matt and Alli weren't scared, I was getting really freaked and said we should stop.
<br><br>
Carol kept making a figure eight around the board, and kept spelling my name. Then it started spelling Lucifer, the name of the devil.  We said goodbye and tried again, but like last time, when we asked who it was it kept spelling Lucifer. Before it could finish, we would say goodbye.
<br><br>
I finally said that I wanted to stop, and I let Matt and Alli do it while I watched.  I was sitting all alone and scooted over by Matt, but when I did, I tripped over the blanket (because I am the biggest klutz ever).  When I fell, something scraped my ankle really hard.  We took the lighter we had been using and lit it right over my ankle so we could see.  There was a huge red mark, and it was scraped.  We looked all over the place, but all we saw were blankets and nothing that could have made that red mark.
<br><br>
They kept talking to Carol, and asked her if she had made me trip.  She said yes, and she was gonna do worse.  Then we said goodbye, and Matt had to go home so we stopped.
<br><br>
I am so freaked out because my parents won't believe me.  I don't know what to do because I keep hearing noises coming from the dark.  I can't be in dark rooms by myself anymore.  I am 13 - I shouldn't be scared of the dark.  I have no idea what to do. Please help.
<br><br>
(I still love ouija boards and think they're tons of fun to do.  I will continue to do them in the future, but I'm just scared of Carol.)

<br><br><br>
If you have any advice or comments for Lauren, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll pass them on to her.
