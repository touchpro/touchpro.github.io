On May 31, 2008 I received an e-mail from Derek about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Derek, and this is my story.
<br><br>
My sister, brother, a close friend of mine, and I (I was about 13) decided to play the Ouija board one night.  We were contacted by Ester Hicks.  She was a great spirit - very polite, never got angry, and was very fun to talk to.  After that night, my sister, brother and I would contact her on a regular basis, just to see how she was doing.  One night we were talking to her, and she became tired and said she had to go.  So we said goodbye, but we still wanted to talk to someone.  My younger brother said, &quot;Let's contact Freddy Kruger.&quot;  Not thinking anything of it, we did.
<br><br>
Well, we got what we asked for.  After about five minutes of him being nice, he turned mean.  And of course we were cocky, taunting him, and we asked him his real name.  He replied &quot;The Joker,&quot; so we poked fun even more.  He started to threaten us, and he started to throw things from the counters to the ground.  We became scared.  I can remember the last thing he said to us before we cut off communication with him: &quot;Don't go to sleep tonight, because I will come and kill you all.&quot;
<br><br>
Now I am the oldest out of us, and am very scared.  My brother was crying, so I contacted Ester right away.  At first we thought it was her, but not too long after we noticed that the spirit wasn't doing what she does (ie she would use one of the back legs and circle the letters, and move slowly).  We demanded to know who it was, and then the front door slammed shut.  We screamed &quot;The Joker&quot; and broke off communication again.  I tried once more to contact Ester, and she came forth.  We didn't even get to say a sentence to her when she said, &quot;I cannot talk, I have to save my strength and protect you. I have to go stop him.&quot;  None of us could sleep that night, and for a couple weeks we didn't touch the Ouija board.  About a month later, my friend asked if we could play it, so we did.  We contacted Ester, and we asked her what she did and if we were in danger.  She replied, &quot;Not anymore, I stopped him.&quot;  I haven't used the Ouija board much since that age, and haven't had anything even close to that experience.  They have been pleasant, like when friends and I contacted John Candy...that was awesome, but another story all its own.
<br><br>
But I do recommend contacting Ester Hicks.  She is very unique in her ways of communication, she even laughed at her death.  Mind you, we were both aware death isn't funny, its just the how, and her response to our question.  I'll be back to check up to see if anyone has contacted her too.
