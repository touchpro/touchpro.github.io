On August 17, 2006 I received an e-mail from Carlie M. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
First of all, by no means do I consider myself to be a believer in ghosts, spirits, or anything that could be considered as metaphysical. I don't rule it out as a possibility, but it's not exactly a subject I'd hold stock in.
<br><br>
When I was 13, I was living in a victorian mini-mansion in Ontario. My parents had just gone through a messy divorce, and my mum wanted to have a priest from her church (Ukranian Orthodox) over to bless the rooms to, I don't know, get out all the negative vibes I guess. So anyways, the same night that the preist is scheduled to come over for dinner and bless the house, I'm supposed to be going to a friends house for a slumber party. I was in charge of bringing the ouija board. I didn't want the priest to see it and destroy it, or tell my mum to get rid of it, so I hid it in a wooden carved box I keep things in under my bed.
<br><br>
The priest arrived, and we went around the house to do the blessing. It was pretty simple, he had his little holy water stick thing, he'd stand in the frame of each rooms doorway, say a small prayer and shake some holy water into the room. After escorting him around the house, we went down to the dining room for dinner. The priest thanked us for dinner and left, and I went to go pack my bag for the sleepover.
<br><br>
It is important to note at this point that at no point was the priest, my mother, my brother, or anyone alone in any part of the house. We were all together throughout the entire blessing process, no doors were closed, and the guy didn't even go into any of the rooms except the family room, morning room, and dining room. At no point did anyone get up from the dinner table.
<br><br>
When I opened the box from under my bed, the board was gone. I never saw it again.
