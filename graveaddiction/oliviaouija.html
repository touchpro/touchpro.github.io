On March 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Olivia M. about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ok, so just tonight my friend Chloe and I (Olivia) were using the Ouija board and were trying to get it to work when finally we got somewhere and it moved to yes when we asked if anyone was with us. We asked it for its name and all it did was go to X and then 9.  It kept doing this until it said goodbye.  We tried again an hour later...we tried again in a different room, and when we asked if anyone was there it said no.  So we asked if it wanted us to leave and it said yes. We asked if we could talk to another spirit and it said no.  And then we asked what its name was, and it said X 9 again.  I don't think it was even the same spirit as before.  Then we asked if we were going to die at nine tonight and it said yes. So then we just said goodbye.  I'm not sure if it was playing a trick on us or something because my friend was really scared...I stayed calm but she was hysterical so I'm not exactly sure if it is true or not.  I'm pretty sure he or she was just playing a joke on us.
