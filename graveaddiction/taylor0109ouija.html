On January 23, 2009 I received an e-mail from Tay about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Okay, about two years ago I created a Ouija board. I decided to play it alone one day (I know most places say not to, but I ignored it). Anyway, I contacted a 15 year old girl named Megan. I asked her how she died, and she said suicide. I asked her why she killed herself and her mom and never came back. Then her ex-boyfriend came. She had broken up, and she told me her story. She told me that when she was about 14, she realized she was a lesbian. Her father was very homophobic, so he stopped caring for her. She left her boyfriend after she realized she wasn't straight. He was angry because she had told him she loved him and all. He had a mental disability and couldn't tell right from wrong.  He went into her house. He didn't know her mom was there, so he killed her. Then he went into Megan's room and raped her. She became depressed from being insulted about being a lesbian and now she had been raped and was an orphan. And to make matter's worse, her ex made her pregnant when he raped her. Then she gave up. She killed herself.
<br><br>
Then I got tired and said goodbye. Thanks for listening to my story.
