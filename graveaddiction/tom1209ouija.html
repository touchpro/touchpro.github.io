On December 4, 2009 I received an e-mail from Tom about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My name is Tom, age 40, and this is a true story. When I was 16 my friends and I started playing with a ouija board. My friend Cory and his brother, Chris, lived out in the country in southeast Wisconsin. Every weekend Cory's dad worked 3rd shift, so 3 teenage boys had the house to ourselves. One Saturday night we were smoking pot, drinking beer, and blasting metal music like usual and some how ended up with a ouija board and started playing. We started off with all the normal questions like names, when will I die, and so on. We kept accusing each other of moving the pointer to spell out answers, so I had the bright idea of figuring out questions to ask that no one in the room knew the answers to, but we could look up somehow to see if the answers were right. And there was no such thing as the internet back then.  We started digging around the house to figure something out, and I was in their dad's room and he had a big stack of albums. They were all old people music and religious music, and I knew that on the back of album covers it listed all the band members and what they played: guitar, drums, etc. So I called my friends in, showed them the albums.  We took 5 of the albums out, laid them on the bed making sure no one could read the back, and started asking the ouija board questions. EXAMPLE: who was the drummer for The Carpenters.  Then the pointer would start spelling out, and Chris's girlfriend would write down the letters, no one in the room spoke a word. The air in that little bed room was so tense you could cut it with a knife, for real. We could see the names of the bands on the cover, but nothing on the back cover since they were laying on the bed. I know for a fact that dope smoking teenagers did not know the names of back up singers for a religeous group we have never heard of. We asked about 15 questions and that board spelled out almost every single name, FIRST and LAST, exactly right, to the letter.  Some of the names were German or something because we couldn't pronounce them, let alone spell them exactly right.  We got so freaked out that we stopped playing, because if all that info was exactly right, what does that say for all those other questions we asked earlier, like when will I die and all that crap.  Now, I didn't want to know, because I was scared shitless!!!  I was so scared that I didn't want to drive home, because I would be by myself. So I called my mom and asked if I could sleep over there, but I had her car and had to bring it home. I was so scared that I drove home with the dome light on, my heart pounding out of my chest, and kept looking at the back seat in case some spirit was going to kill me. I have not touched a ouija board since that day.  TRUE STORY.  Can someone please tell me how this is possible, because I just don't get it...
