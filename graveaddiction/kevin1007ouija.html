On October 6, 2007 I received an e-mail from Kevin about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Last night was my first experience with a Ouija, and I'm concerned because of what happened.
<br><br>
Last night we ended up doing multiple sessions.  Three of which were in sequence and were disturbing and odd.  There were 4 people: myself, C, B and A.
<br><br>
The first session we ended up with someone very quickly.  We asked the spirit if it was good, and it said yes.  Then we asked if it was an adult, and it said no.  We then proceeded with gender, and it answered yes to girl.  We then asked if there was more than one spirit, and it said there were five present.
<br><br>
From there it started spelling out my friend's name, and answered yes to if he was being watched by them.  We then asked if this was the same person, and they said no.  We asked if something bad was to happen, and they answered yes.  During this time, my other friend went into a heaving mode that seemed very odd.  After that we said goodbye and turned the board over and wiped it.
<br><br>
The next session dealt with a group of five as well, and this time we asked if they were good and they said no.  We asked if he was going to hurt us, and he said yes.  We then said goodbye to him.
<br><br>
The third time was when it got truly creepy.
<br><br>
We got a group of five again this time.  We asked them questions, and apparently the one we were talking to knew our friend as well.  He started to spell out the word devil as DEVL, repeatedly missing the I.  We asked if he was spelling devil and he said yes.  The next word was kill.
<br><br>
After much asking on these terms, we got that he was one of five devils that were going to kill, and that it involved my friend in some way.  We ended up saying goodbye and wiping the board.
<br><br>
We then found out that my friend was being paranoid from the beginning and drew a pentacle on his palm, but if looked at from the pointer's view, it appeared as a pentagram.  We ended up leaving him out for the next two runs.
<br><br>
The following run there were seven spirits, but they didn't say much and ended up leaving so we said goodbye.
<br><br>
The last group frightened me as well.  We asked if there was more than one, and they said yes.  We then asked how many there were and the board went to 6, then 5, then 4, and before we let it go lower we said goodbye and dismissed them, turned the board over, and wiped it.
<br><br>
I didn't know we were doing things wrong until now after reading this site.  We sort of jumped in with my friend C's experience.  It didn't help that B was wearing a possible pentagram and was super paranoid, or that A was slightly buzzed and still had a little drink left.
<br><br>
Our board was homemade, consisting of letters, numbers, goodbye, hello, yes, and no on mini cards of printer paper.  After each session we scattered the board, then turned it over and wiped the board.
<br><br>
If anyone knows what some of this means, input would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if anyone knows what kind of precautions we should do for next time then thanks in advance :)
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice for Kevin, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward your advice on.
