On May 20, 2007 I received an e-mail from Sarah about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My three friends all got into it before they introduced me to the Ouija, and they contacted their &quot;guardian angels.&quot;  My friend Jill had a guardian angel named Zaz. When they finally got me to do the Ouija with them, I didn't believe it and thought they were the ones moving it. Whenever we started out talking to Zaz, which was always what happened, he moved it around really fast, always acting as if he was mad about something. As we kept on doing the Ouija every weekend, weirder things started happening. We were all paranoid about everything, and we kept hearing him moving things and tapping on things. We were all joking around about it, trying not to be scared, and my other friend Hillary told Zaz to hand her her drink on the table. The candles we had burning all blew out, and we all screamed. As soon as I jumped up to go and turn the light on, Hillary was covered in her drink. She screamed and ran out of the room. When we finally calmed her down, we all did it again and this is a little how the conversation went...
<br><br>
Me: Zaz, is this you?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Jill: Did you spill Hillary's drink all over her?<br>
Board: Yes.<br>
<br>
Hillary: Why did you do it?<br>
Board: Make you believe.<br>
<br>
Tina: We did believe though.<br>
Board: No.<br>
<br>
Jill: Will you ever scare us like that again?<br>
Board: Now.<br>
<br>
The coin we were using started going in circles all crazy.  We all took our fingers off of it, and it flew off the board and on hit the wall. Then the light turned off, and when Hillary and I went to go and turn it on, it wouldn't. The door slammed shut and we heard a laugh. After that, we've never touched the Ouija again.
