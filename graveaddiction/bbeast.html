On March 13, 2001 I had the honor to &quot;meet&quot; 
another one of Mark's cars....this time I met the &quot;Black Beast&quot;.  The Black Beast is a 1984 Pontiac Grand Prix.  It has a 1981 engine (from some 
type of GM car, for some reason I want to say it was from an Olds but I could be wrong), and it 
has over 100,000 miles on it.  The Black Beast was &quot;out to pasture&quot;, just like Old Blue until 
March 9th.  Mark sold one of the other cars that he had up here in Columbus (the Old Gray Buick) 
to his friend John from Gallipolis so it was time to resurrect the Black Beast.   Around 10 PM 
on the 9th I got a phone call from Mark, telling me that the Black Beast was on the 100 mile 
trip up to Columbus.  He had some friends follow him in case it died!!!
<br><br>
I was asleep so I was kinda out of it when he called (I know, it's pathetic that I am 21 and was asleep at 10 on a 
Friday night - but it was a rough week!) so I wasn't that excited about the Black Beast coming 
to Columbus.  But the next morning I woke up and thought I had a dream about Mark calling me and 
telling me that the Black Beast was coming to Columbus, but then I realized that it wasn't a 
dream, I was really going to meet the Black Beast!!  I didn't think he was going to ever bring it up here, at one point he was even thinking of selling it, so I 
was overjoyed that I would get to see this car!!!
<br><br>
March 13th was a rainy day in 
Columbus, lots of wind too.  Mark and I thought we'd have to pick another evening for me to 
meet the Black Beast, but then it cleared up a little so he came over to my place after work.  
As soon as I walked outside I could smell the gas, oil, and exhaust.  It was almost, not quite, 
as bad as Old Blue scent wise!  But the exterior wasn't really all that bad.  Oh sure, it had 
some &quot;minor&quot; problems....like the crack in the windshield that ran 3/4 of the way across the 

glass!!!  And it was a little muddy from sitting in the field.  And it was kinda banged up and 
had some scratches.  But other than that it was fantastic!
<br><br>
Now the ride.  That's when things 
got interesting.  The first thing I noticed was that there is a crack in the windshield whistles 
LOUDLY when driving fast - when it hits about 45 mph it really starts to whistle!!!  I also 
noticed that the car is loud.  A fan in the car makes a REALLY loud noise.  I don't know what 
Mark does to get it to sound so loud, but it makes this terrible noise that scares pedestrians!  
A belt in the car is also loud.  It makes a screeching noise sometimes.  That was scary too!  
I also noticed that the speedometer rattles the whole time the car is running.  It was quite 
annoying!  And the needle in the speedometer wobbles!  Bu that's not all that rattles, one of the 
panels on the dashboard rattles too, Mark even admitted that he might have to fix that before it 
gets on his nerves.  Another thing I noticed was that the windshield wipers were really bad, but 
at least those are easy to replace.  And then my favorite.  To turn on one of the turn signals 
Mark had to hold down the little switch thing because it won't stay down by itself.  And the 
left turn signal can't be used when braking, because if your foot is on the brake and you 
attempt to use the left signal the right turn signal blinks instead, and Mark said that 
sometimes the horn will blow too!!
<br><br>
But the good news is that some of 
the stuff in the Black Beast works great!  It has power door locks, power windows, and a clock 
on the dashboard that works....you know, the really important things!!  And all of the lights 
work, so that's good too!  I was really happy that I got to 
ride in the Black Beast, it was...well....an interesting experience!  One I will never forget, 
that's for sure.  And I must admit it was a little better than my experience with Old Blue....
at least the Black Beast didn't die in rush hour traffic!!  I wasn't at all upset about that!!
<br><br>
I am very thankful that Mark lets 
me meet his cars...he's the best!!  I am even more thankful that I didn't die from carbon 
monoxide poisoning after riding in the Black Beast!!!!  Just kidding Mark!! Anyway, if you haven't already 
checked it out, you must read the story about <a href="oldblue.html">my adventure in Old Blue</a>!
