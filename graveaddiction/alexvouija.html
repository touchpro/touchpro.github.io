On March 6, 2006 I received an e-mail from Alex Veloso about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;On the night of March 5th, me (Alex) and my brother (Michael) were visiting our cousins, aunts, and uncles for dinner. I am 13 years old, my brother is 11 years old, and my twin cousins, Katie and Jessica, are 15 years old. My cousins decided to play with an ouija board.  I got really excited because I had never played, and neither had my brother.  Here is our experience, word-for-word:
<br><br>
All of us: When will our parents come and call us for dinner?<br>
Board: 8 minutes<br>
<br>
Alex: Are you sure?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Katie: Is there anything negative that will happen within the next 8 minutes?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jessica: What is going to happen?<br>
Board: An unexpected surprise<br>
<br>
***At this point we were pretty spooked out***<br><br>
***8 minutes later***
<br><br>
My mom and dad didn't call us for dinner yet, so we thought the board was fake after all.  Then suddenly the door flew right open...that was our biggest scare!  We were all running in the opposite direction of the door, and no one had came from the doorway...the door was LOCKED, so no one could get in...so how did it happen????<br><br>
We continued...
<br><br>
Michael: Is there something negative you'd like to share with us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
All of us: What is it you'd like to share?<br>
Board: DIE B***H<br>
<br>
**We immediately stopped playing...but for some odd reason we wanted to continue and play more.**
<br><br>
Alex: Why would you say something like that?<br>
Board: There is going to be an attack<br>
<br>
Jessica & Katie: Who is going to be attacked?<br>
Board: Blanche<br>
<br>
***Blache is our grandmother***
<br><br>
All of us: Who is going to attack her?<br>
Board: Abby<br>
<br>
***Our dog***
<br><br>
At that point we stopped playing.  But not only did we stop playing, we forgot to say goodbye.
<br><br>
Later that night, at my house, all during the night our speaker system was making noises and that really spooked us out.  There couldn't be anything wrong with the speakers because we JUST got them.
<br><br>
Definitely a scary experience...but I would play again.&quot;
