On March 8, 2005 I received an e-mail from Mary Beth Clemons about her interesting experience with the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;We always channeled a very fun and sincere spirit/person named Vega.  As soon as we touched the planchette, he would zip it over to &quot;Hello&quot;.  He often told us how much fun it was to talk to us and how silly I was and how interesting my friend, Carrie, was.  He never seemed interested in giving us information or answering questions about the unknown, but more interested in seeing how we were because he thought we were &quot;charming young ladies&quot;.
<br><br>
Is it possible for a living spirit to communicate with you via the board? He told us that he was not dead. Once he moved slow and told us that we woke him up and wanted to go back to sleep.  After that, we always asked him if he was too busy to talk to us. We saw him once while driving in a silver car that drove up next to us and we could only make out his profile briefly before it sped away, but Carrie and I had the immediate same reaction of &quot;Vega!&quot;.  When we used the board later that day, it went over to hello as usual and we asked if it was Vega and we got the reply of &quot;MOSI&quot; (Museum of Science and Industry) which was where Carrie and I were going and close to where we saw him.  He then said &quot;Fun?&quot;  And Carrie says &quot;you probably already know!&quot; And he said &quot;red lift&quot; and we laughed because Carrie and I got stuck in a red elevator there for about 15 minutes during which we theorized was Vega's fault!&quot;
