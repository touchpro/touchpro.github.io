On June 13, 2005 I received an e-mail from Ryan, AKA Beatty, about an extremely creepy ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
&quot;My friends and I always hung out.  We never even talked about the Ouija board or nothing really, and my friend brought it to a little get together.  There were a bunch of us there.  Myself (Ryan aka Beatty) Shane (aka Freddy), Brian (aka Lawson), Corey (aka Ham), along with Evan, Julie, Karli, and Samantha (aka Sam).  Karli had a large property with a woods in back.  It was just outside the small town of Castalia, Ohio.  We put down a blanket and gathered around.  About half of us really believed it would work.  But there were several skeptics...including Lawson, Ham, and Evan.  
<br><br>
We started playing by the light of flashlights....and made contact.  Every word was spelled out with speed and a strong pull on the pointer.  We noticed a lot of misspelled words though.  As the event went on, for over an hour at least, we found out several details about this spirit.  She was 12 years old and died in 1849 of tuberculosis.  Despite the objections of friends, I asked her if she needed help.  She immediately responded &quot;yes.&quot;  Yet we could not figure out what she was saying.  We could not get a name from her.  We continued and were persistant.  The flashlight heated up, and on a calm, still night there was movement was all around us.  We all panicked and ran.....not one of us wasn't scared.  We called it a night.
<br><br>
The next weekend we continued, trying to contact the same spirit.  We asked her to show herself.  She said she would for only 3 people.  One of which was a newcomer....Tyler, Lawson, and Evan.  Everybody chickened out when the air chilled.  We yet again put it off until another night.
<br><br>
I was absent for this night, but this is a consistant account I got form several people.  They were questioning this spirit, and it told them specifically not to leave.  One left, Evan.  After he left, it asked &quot;where is the lost one?&quot;  followed by &quot;where is his mom?&quot;
<br><br>  
After arriving home, Evan discovered his mom wasn't there.  She was in a car accident and in the hospital for minor injuries.
<br><br>  
This is when she got personal.  The dreams and paranoia began.  Shane had a dream where he saw his family and friends brutalized and the vision of a girl in a potato sack.  This followed a dream where he was a slave girl being forced to play with a sick slave-owner's daughter. His mother had a dream from the point of view of a sick white girl playing with a slave girl.  His sister had a similar dream in which she was the mother of the sick child.
<br><br>
Evan also had a dream about a sick black girl.  She wanted him to care about her......and he was afraid.
<br><br>  
Ham refused to play any longer, and Julie ended up in an accident where she is still recovering after waking from a coma.  Karli, Sam, and Tyler haven't been present for any more events. 
<br><br>
She follows us, it seems like there is always soemthing there...and we are afraid.  She told us not to tell anyone about her.  I have broken the silence.  On my neck I wear a St. Christopher pendant on my necklace.  We each received one from a psychic who told us to burn the board.&quot;
