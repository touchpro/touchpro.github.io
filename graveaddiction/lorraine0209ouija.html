On February 18, 2009 I received an e-mail from Lorraine O. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

This story is on behalf of my Dad, who is still alive but doesn't like to talk about this story.  He told my mum (as he was going out with my mum at the time this happened to him), and it was on a night my Dad was drunk that I managed to get him to tell me what happened to him and his mates whilst playing the Ouija Board.
<br><br>
This was when my Dad was in his twenties (he's 60 yrs old now).  My Dad was a real live wire, and most likely up to no good most of the time.  Anyway, him and his mates all went down to this derelict house, taking along the Ouija Board.  They started playing on it, and the only reason why they were using it was they wanted to know who was going to win on the horses so they could put a bet on the upcoming horse racing.
<br><br>
After a few minutes of trying, a spirit came through.  But before it would answer any of their questions (and there were about 6 of the lads including my Dad), it requested that they turn around a holy picture of the Virgin Lady so it wasn't showing.  They did, then it requested that one of the lads there (don't know his name) would have to leave.  This lad was known to be a really good guy, so anyway they gave him his marching orders and off he went.  Then the spirit started to swear and spell out to them that they were all damned and going to hell.  With this, the guys started swearing back at this spirit, and the spirit went on telling them that they were all no good and doomed to the depths of hell.  Then the glass flew from the table – smashing against a wall, and the board went flying in another direction.  After that, the whole house they were standing in started to shake, like it was about to fall apart.  The lads all made a run for a smashed window to get out, as the floor shook and bits of walls and ceiling started to fall on them.  As they all went for this same window at the same time, they all jammed together trying to get out of the window.  There was jiggered glass around this window, and they managed to cut their arms and legs to ribbons.  My Dad said that him and his mates as soon as they were out to the other side...without a word they ran as fast as they could, all towards home.
<br><br>
From then on, my Dad has vowed never to use a Ouija Board.  He warned me not to myself.  I know this story is true, as my Dad doesn't even like it when I bring up the subject.  I have never played the Ouija Board myself – wouldn't rule it out though.
