On August 9, 2008 I received an e-mail from Kenzie about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

My friend Brianna and I (Kenzie) tried out the ouija board for the second time last night. The first time we played it was a little freaky, but I won't go into detail. Apparently everyone has a ghost, or &quot;spirit guide,&quot; that follows them around. And mine is named Seth. As soon as we started playing, Seth came on.
<br><br>
Me: Do you have anything important you need to tell us?<br>
Seth: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What is it?<br>
Seth: Death<br>
<br>
Me: What? Who?<br>
Seth: Nick (my brother's name)<br>
<br>
It then proceeded to tell us how he was going to die in a car accident, with Erica. When we asked it when, it said now. Erica is my brother's girlfriend. I didn't have any idea where Nick was that night, so I decided to call him. He told me that he was at his friend's house, so I told him nevermind, that it was stupid. He kept insisting that I tell him what it was. So finally I told him that the ouija board told me he was going to die in a car accident with Erica. He said, &quot;Okay, okay. Alright, alright.&quot; and the phone died. I called back. He was getting out of the car with Erica. He was with her in the car when I had told him, and he made her stop. He had lied to me about being with her, because he didn't want me to tell my mom.
<br><br>
We were really freaked out. A little while later though, we began to play it again. We talked to a different ghost, I'm still not sure who it was. It kept saying death, and the names of people I was close to. First it said that Brianna was going to die. It simply said chair. Then we checked a couple minutes later and it said she was fine. Then it said I was going to die, from stairs. I asked it how, because I didn't have any stairs. It spelled out Jenna's. I'm going to a party tonight at a girl named Jenna's. She has stairs. Then it said one of my other friends was going to die. When we asked it how, it said rifle. When we asked it when, it just kept trying to spell out evil, satan, demon, etc. And then fuck you. We stopped it everytime. We flipped the board over, and this morning we cut it into seven pieces and buried it.
