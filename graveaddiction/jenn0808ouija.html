On August 5, 2008 I received an e-mail from Jenn about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So I have this crazy story about my friend and I using the ouija board. We made our own since we don't own one, and we had around five candles and a light that was dimmed a little. We were sitting in my living room at the table, and we began talking to this one spirit. We asked its name and it spelled S.W. That was its initials. We then asked if it was once a human, and it said no. Then we asked if it was a guardian angel, and it said no.  Then it spelled fallen, so it was a fallen angel or demon. My friend said, &quot;But I thought you were a nice spirit&quot; (because we asked for a friendly, nice spirit to talk to us in the opening). It went to yes, then spelled, &quot;I am near.&quot;  That is when I suddenly got this cold chill down my spine, as if someone was watching me. Then my friend asked, &quot;Where are you?&quot; The shot glass slid slowly towards me, and every inch it came closer, my body suddenly became completely cold. My friend then asked if it was here to harm us, and I suddenly felt a breeze by my legs as if a fan was blowing on me but the air was ice cold. My eyes got really wide, and my friend noticed my expression.  She ran out before the spirit was done spelling, and I followed her to persuade her back into the room to close it up. My friend and I don't get scared easily (like we walk to each other's houses through the woods at midnight by ourselves and don't think about anything), but I have NEVER been so scared before.
<br><br>
That was my first experience with the ouija board.
