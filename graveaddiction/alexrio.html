<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana">Alex Cerda sent me the following information about this interesting, haunted cemetery:
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I come from a very haunted and rich in folklore place in the Rio Grande Valley of south
Texas. The city graveyard in my home town harbors a  great deal of paranormal happenings and stories. We
have a weeping woman (La llorona), lycanthropy, owl witches (Lechuzas), and El Chupacabra. I myself have
witnessed lycanthropy and an owl witch in that very graveyard.&quot;</blockquote> 
<br>
Since I was curious about Alex's lycanthropy experience and lechuzas, he sent me even more information!
<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;I had a lycanthropy experience once in the very same graveyard those pics were taken at. One summer two friends and I were walking around the cemetery at about 3 in the morning, doing a little unofficial ghost
hunting (we did not have cameras or audio recorders). We heard a groan come from the darkness in front of us. I shined my flashlight into a large mesquite tree, when suddenly a naked hairy man jumps from a branch of the tree and lands on all fours in front of us. Note: mesquite trees have very sharp thorns, not a place to be around barefooted. He turned around and took three long leaps into the tall grass and vanished from site.
<br><br>
The very next morning, we paid a second visit and found some very deep scratch marks on the same tree the man
had jumped out from. We also found a trail made from smashed down grass from the tree down to a ditch, and
up the other side. About a year later I ran across an old newspaper clipping that dated back to 1944 about a
man who arrived at the San Benito hospital severely ravished. He claimed he was visiting his mother’s grave that day on her death's anniversary...in the same graveyard I had my experience at...when he was suddenly attacked by a pack of werewolves. His car also had some uncanny and deep scratch marks. When I first had the experience, I considered lyacnthropy as a possible explanation, but after stumbling upon the newspaper clipping I am convinced what we saw was a lycanthrope.
<br><br>
You also wanted to know about Lechuzas. Lechuzas are witches who shape shift into large half woman, half owl   creatures. When I was a child I saw a currandero (witch healer) cast a ritual and drop a lechuza from a tree and stab it in the heart with a silver knife. My mother forced me to turn away at that point so I missed the &quot;shape shifting back to human form&quot;. The lechuza that was killed by the currandero was allegedly causing trouble in the neighborhood. If you go to <a href="http://www.teresafbarker.com" target="_blank">teresafbarker.com</a> you can read about lechuzas. She calls them by their other name, Tecolotes. If you click on the site map on the homepage, you will find tecolotes under supernatural. Teresa Barker had some bad experiences with lechuzas herself. The kind of lechuzas that were bothering her were not shape shifters, they were sent by witches to do the harm. I personally know a Bruja (witch) who keeps owls in cages in her backyard. You can guess what she does with them.&quot;</blockquote>
