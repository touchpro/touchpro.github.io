On June 13, 2005 I received an e-mail from Dave Phillips about his first time using the ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I have played the board and nothing odd has happened.....yet.  Me and my friend Monkey (real name Cliff) played it while our chum Darren wrote everything down.  Here is what happened step by step, some of it was quite amusing! 
<br><br><br> 
Me (Dave):  Is there anyone present who wishes to speak?<br>
Board: No response<br><br>
 
Me: Is there anyone there?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Monkey: Victory!  Who are we speaking to?<br>
Board: Matthew<br><br>
 
Me: What is your surname?<br>
Board: *no response*<br><br>
 
Monkey: You bust it!  Let me try!  Is there anyone else there?<br>
Board: William<br><br>
 
Monkey: How old are you William?<br>
Board: 20<br><br>
 
Monkey: Did you live near here?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Monkey: How did you ermm.... pass on?<br>
Board: *no response*<br><br>
 
Me: See?  You've pissed him off.  Is there anybody else there?<br>
Board: Alan<br><br>
 
Me: How old are you Alan?<br>
Board: *planchette moves around the board in a number 8 shape.<br><br>
 
Me: How old are you?<br>
Board: planchette tries to move off the board. >>> Monkey grabs it . "Don't let it move off the board!"  I heard thats bad luck.<br><br>
 
Me: How old are you Alan?<br>
Board: 10<br><br>
 
Me: how many other spirits are with you?<br>
Board: 10<br><br>
 
Me: Are the spirits with you all good?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Me: Are you good?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Darren(the guy writing all this down): This is f***ed up guys - I want no part of it.<br>
Monkey: Wise up you old man - this is good craic<br>
 
Me: Is there anyone else who wants to speak?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Monkey: What is your name?<br>
Board: Thames<br><br>
 
Monkey: Thames?  Don't you mean Thomas?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Monkey: Ok Thames, how old are you?<br>
Board: 10<br><br>
 
Monkey: What is the name of the street you lived in?<br>
Board: ADAF *spells out a lot of gibberish.<br><br>
 
Board: *planchette again tries to move off the board.<br>
Monkey: stop doin that!<br><br>
 
Me: Are we really speaking to Thames?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Me: Is this Alan?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Me: Are you going to let anyone else speak?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Me: Do you like us?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Me: Do you like Darren?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Me: Why do you not like Darren?<br>
Board: Liar<br><br>
 
Me: You think Darren is a liar?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
**Please note that darren has been known to tell us quite a few tall tales over the years**<br><br>
 
Me: What else do you not like about Darren?<br>
Board: smells<br><br>
 
Monkey: Darren smells?  So what else is new?  heh heh.  Just kiddin mate.<br><br>
 
Darren: F*** you guys, I've had enough of this freaky shit.<br><br>
 
**Darren proceeds to throw the notepad at us and heads for the fridge to make a sandwich.<br><br>
 
Me: What year were you born?<br>
Board: 1900<br><br>
 
Me: Ok that will do for tonight, we have to go now, ok?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Monkey: We will speak to you another nite, ok?<br>
Board: *planchette moves in the number 8 shape again and tries to moves off the board.<br><br>
 
Me: If we promise to speak to you another nite, can we go?<br>
Board: Yes<br><br>
 
Monkey & Me: We promise to speak to you again another night.<br>
Me: Can we go now?<br>
Board: No<br><br>
 
Monkey: Screw this.  *Monkey moves the planchette to GOODBYE.<br><br>
 
Thats it!&quot;
