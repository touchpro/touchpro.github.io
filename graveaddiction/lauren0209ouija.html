On February 22, 2009 I received an e-mail from Lauren S. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Alright, so we were playing ouija board and it was like intense. It told Jacey she was going to die at 18 in a drinking and driving car accident, and it told me I was going to die at 89 from colin cancer. Which is super weird, because my whole family pretty much has had cancer. But then I was trying to see if this thing was true. So I asked it where I just moved here from, and they said N.C. So that freaked me out.
<br><br>
ALRIGHT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS SUPER WEIRD.
<br><br>
It said, &quot;Lauren, go upstairs now.&quot; We were like why, and they said that it left me a present. They wouldn't tell us what it was. I asked where I should look for it, and they said behind the hamper in Jordyn's room. So I went up and looked.  I didn't see anything, and I looked really good. Then I came back downstairs, and I told it that I didn't see anything. He said look again, and hard. So I went upstairs and looked hard...I saw a ring. I picked it up, and it said &quot;Jesus saves.&quot; As I was walking downstairs, Jordyn, Jacey, and Angela were asking what he gave me. He was spelling out a ring as I came down and told them it was a ring!!!!
<br><br>
Later i asked it why he gave it to me. He said it will save me from a car accident, and that I need to wear it forever. I got really freaked out, and I was like I'm going to wear this forever. I took it off, and asked if I was wearing it.  He said no.  I put it on and asked if I was, and he said yes. THIS SHIT IS REAL.
<br><br>
Later I asked where he got the ring, and he said my old house. I asked if it was his, and he said yes. Then I left Jordyn's house.  They were playing still, and Angela's guardian came back to talk to her.  That guy that said his name was Santian. So she was asking if I was going to get possessed from this ring, and she said yes...on 2/28, which is next Saturday. They asked if I should take the ring off, and she said yes. She said that it was the ring of the devil, and that's why there is a cut in the back of it. Which freaked me out, because I was home and I got a call from them saying to take it off and shit. I threw it in my trash can, and I want it out of my house right now. But I don't know what to do with it. But fuck the ouija board. That shit is real and don't do it. I cried so much that night. Neeeverrrr again.
