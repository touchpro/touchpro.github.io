On October 26, 2008 I received an e-mail from Lucky about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Here's a story that is very true. When I was 15 I bought a Parker Brothers Ouija Board. I knew never to play with a ouija
board alone;  So I only used it with friends. Well, after a few months I forgot about the board.  A couple of years had passed now, and I was 18.  One night I was out with friends, and I got home about 6:30. One of my grandmother's sister's and her daughter were at my house. The first words out of the daughters mouth was &quot;where is your ouija board?&quot;
I stood there looking at her like, how did she know? She told me to find the board because she could feel evil spirits in my house. I looked at her like she was on drugs.
<br><br>
I went and found the board, and brought it into the parlor.  My mom's cousin told me to break it and get rid of it;  well I tried breaking it in half using a few different ways.  Needless to say, it wouldn't break. I took the board out in the backyard and I tried lighting it on fire. It wouldn't catch. I grabbed a can of lighter fluid that was out there,  pouring some on it, and it still wouldn't light.  Finally, after using almost a whole can of fluid, it finally caught.  What came next I will remember for the rest of my life.
<br><br>
When the board finally started to turn to ashes, out of the flames came out this thing.  It was the size of a worm and had the head of a serpent.  It looked at me and hissed, then went into the ground. Thank God my mother was out there and saw it too, because I would have thought I was nuts. When we went back into the house, I questioned my mother about how her cousin knew I had the board.  My mom told me that my little sister, at the time she was 8, found and used the board by herself, trying to contact my grandfather.  At that time my family was attending Gospel Temple Assembly of Gods Church. So to all
those people who think you can be a person of God and the board won't hurt you, think again.  For many years after that, we had spirits in our home.  Having your home blessed doesn't always get rid of the spirits.  And another word of advice is you never, ever burn a ouija board, which I wish I had know that back then. What happenes when you burn the board is you're only burning the board...any spirits in the board that you have contacted are released. So don't ever burn a Ouija board, and better yet, don't play with it.  I'm 37 years old now.
