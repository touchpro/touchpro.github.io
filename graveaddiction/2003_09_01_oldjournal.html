I am loving this cooler fall weather!  The weekend was beautiful, I spent most of it outside.  Saturday I walked around a few (five to be exact) Fairfield County cemeteries, including Forest Rose Cemetery...it's gigantic.  I compare it to Greenlawn Cemetery in Columbus as far as size goes, but it's much prettier.  There are lots of steep hills and winding roads.  There are even some brick roads.  I found one hill with a gorgeous view of Mount Pleasant and downtown Lancaster.  Visiting that cemetery alone made my Saturday worthwhile.  I enjoyed all of the cemeteries though, and will probably get some of the photos out there either tomorrow or Wednesday night.<br /><br />This weekend is my friend Mark's bonfire.  I'm excited about it, it was lots of fun last year.  I'm planning to visit lots of Southern Ohio and West Virginia cemeteries before the bonfire, I'm excited about that as well!  I'm always very thankful to the website visitors who tell me about and send me directions to cemeteries and haunted places in their towns.  Mark is going to go to two of the cemeteries with me, then I'll drop him off at his parents' place.  Then I'll pick up John and explore the places in West Virginia with him.  I think this weekend will be a blast!<br /><br />I put up all of my Halloween decorations yesterday.  I had fun doing that, I love Halloween!  I am sort of sad though, one of my favorite decorations isn't working very well...I bought the haunted toilet in 1996, after Halloween when it was on sale.  It's a little toilet, and when you flush it a skull pushes the lid open, and it's eyes flash red when it says &quot;Happy Halloween, hahahahaha&quot;.  It still sounds OK, but the skull is hardly able to push the lid open anymore.   I'd love to find another one, but I haven't seen a haunted toilet anywhere since 1996.  It's so sad!<br /><br />Well, it's time for me to get to work...here's hoping the day goes fast!<br><br>

I had one of the busiest, most hectic days at work ever!<br /><br />But first, let me tell you about last night...I received one of the strangest phone calls.  The phone rang around 10:30 PM.  Usually no one calls that late, and the caller ID said &quot;Private Name, Private Number&quot;.  I knew it wouldn't be a sales call that late, so I answered it.  After saying hello, the first words I heard were "Well hello Beth *Removed for Privacy*"...I instantly knew it was Mark, he's the only friend who always calls me by both my first and last name.  He told me he had something I had to hear.  He held out the phone so I could hear the TV.  And guess what...he was watching Dukes of Hazzard reruns again!  He found the episode with the line &quot;I'm madder than a long haired dog in a tub of fleas&quot;.  Why would he feel the need to call me at 10:30 just so I could hear that?  Well, Mark uses that saying quite frequently, and I always laugh at him when he says it.  He learned it from that episode, so he wanted me to hear it on the TV for myself.  Too funny!!!<br /><br />Now back to my day at work.  It was so crazy!  I was scheduled to do a training session for my division on this new testing software we're using.  The software is really easy to use, so I wasn't worried about the training at all.  However, everything started going wrong!  Here's a list of everything that happened:<br /><ol><br /><li>First thing I did after taking my morning break was pop in the disk that I saved the training handout on.  I attempted to open the document, and I received one of those &quot;disk is corrupted&quot; errors.  I couldn't get to my document!!  I had to hurry and rewrite the whole thing!<br /><li>OK, so I got the training document done.  Next I opened the example I created with the new software.  I hit the &quot;generate cases&quot'; button to make sure it worked...and guess what, it didn't.  The person who wrote the software is out on vacation all week, so I called one of his teammates.  Turns out no one else is familiar enough with the software to help with my error.  So I created the demo from scratch too.  I finally got it to work.  I thought that was the end of my problems...<br /><li>I had to load the software onto the Six Sigma blackbelt's laptop (since my division didn't have one I could use.  Went to his desk, found out he was in a meeting until 10AM, which is when my training was supposed to begin.  I freaked out a little, so my manager found the conference room he was in, pulled him aside and asked if he could give us his laptop real quick.  He gave it to us and went back to his meeting.<br /><li>Took the laptop to my desk and attempted to install the software.  Looked like things were working fine.  Then I got the dreaded &quot;you must have administrative rights to install software&quot;...Jeff, the Six Sigma guy, of course was the administrator, so I'd need his ID and password.  My manager and I didn't want to interrupt his meeting again, so we didn't know what to do since we needed the laptop to do the software demo.  Ben then suggested taking my PC, my <b>desktop tower PC</b> downstairs to the conference room.  Really, that was the only option so I unplugged everything.  Hauling that big computer down to the conference room was just too funny, it's definitely not something you see everyday.  <br /><li>Plugged in the computer in the conference room.  Hooked up the projector.  Guess what...Ben and the Facility Services guy couldn't get the projector to work with my computer.  So I ended up doing the training without it.  I had to draw an Excel spreadsheet on one of those big tablet things.  It was too funny.<br /><li>The training went well.  Took my computer back to my cube.  Hooked it up and turned it on.  My monitor wouldn't work.  The light came up and flashed, but the actual monitor itself stayed black.  I couldn't figure out what I did wrong.  Asked my coworker Jason to come over and take a look at it.  He played around with it for a long time.  Ben, my manager, came over and laughed.  Then Jason figured it out...I had two places were I could hook up the monitor, and I plugged it into the wrong one.  Ben looked at me...turns out he had plugged the projector into the same one I plugged the monitor into!  At least we figured out why the projector didn't work :)<br /></ol><br />So anyway, I'm exhausted tonight.  Work really wore me out!<br><br>

I've been slacking on my blogging duties again, I haven't posted anything since Friday!<br /><br />My weekend was fun.  I went to a ghost hunt at <a href="http://www.prospectplace-dresden.com" target="_blank">Prospect Place</a> in Trinway, OH (it's a small town near Dresden, the Longaberger basket place).  I had a fun time, and took quite a few photos.  I haven't developed the ones taken with the 35mm camera, but you can see the photos I took with the digital camera by <a href="prospect.html">clicking here</a>.<br /><br />The only other thing that happened this weekend was the light bulb adventure.  First, let me say that I have successfully and easily changed light bulbs millions of times before this weekend.  This weekend I ran into some problems.  Right as I was getting ready to leave for the ghost hunt on Saturday evening I discovered that the light bulb in the entranceway had burnt out.  I pulled out the step ladder and removed the shade.  I then noticed, before I even attempted to remove the bulb, that the glass part had separated from the metal part.  So I went and found some pliers to use help remove the metal part of the bulb from the socket.  Not only did I worry about getting electrocuted by accidentally sticking the metal pliers in the socket (even though the switch was off!), but I couldn't get the metal to twist out.  All I succeeded in doing was slowly tearing the metal part to shreds...it kept getting smaller and smaller.  I tried pulling on it harder with the pliers, and I managed to twist the base of the light, separating it from the ceiling.  By that point I was extremely frustrated, so I left (leaving the light hanging from the ceiling.  When I got home early Sunday morning I was too tired to mess around with it.  Sunday afternoon I was FINALLY able to get the metal part of the bulb out of the socket and get the light reattached to the ceiling.  But my problems weren't over...When I stepped down off the step ladder, I realized that twisting the metal part out with the pliers got little shards of metal and glass all over the floor.  And I discovered that by stepping on a teeny, tiny glass shard.  It was a real pain to dig out of my foot, it was so little and thin that the tweezers kept breaking it.  I think getting the glass out of my foot hurt more than stepping on it!  But thankfully the light bulb adventure ended.  I've know learned, thanks to Kate, that I can use a potato to remove the metal part of the light bulb, should this ever happen again.  Definitely a good thing to know.  Also, I think I agree with Michelle...<a href="ouija032003.html">Dug Hole</a> was definitely with me this weekend, and it's his fault I was so accident prone!<br /><br />I just found out yesterday that I have been nominated for the IA Systems employee of the month again.  I have a meeting next Tuesday to get my photo taken with the other nominees and Mike, our systems officer.  I was also nominated last year for the October employee of the month.  I was hoping I wouldn't get nominated again.  Don't get me wrong, being nominated should make me feel proud or something.  However, I hate drawing attention to myself like that.  My photo and nomination letter will be sent out to the whole department.  Then people will whisper things like &quot;what did <b>she</b> do to get nominated&quot;, &quot;she must be the manager's pet&quot;, etc.  Last time the phrase &quot;Beth is a model analyst&quot; was used in my nomination letter, that <i>really</i> made people give me a hard time.  Oh well, I guess I'll try not to be modest and feel proud instead.  It will be interesting to find out what I was nominated for...I should have more details next Tuesday!<br /><br />My coworker Brenda was just over here, she had a question about geckos.  I wasn't a ton of help since I'm a frog owner, but I was able to help a little.  Anyway, she was telling me about this strange lady she saw in the grocery store last night.  All this lady was buying was a pint of beer, but she was pushing a shopping cart around.  Brenda looked in the cart and was shocked to see a snapping turtle.  She asked the lady about it, and she told Brenda she thought it could use some fresh air.  So first of all, I don't know too many people who keep snapping turtles as pets since they can bite really hard.  Guess this lady knew that though, she told Brenda it's bit her several times, and a few times it bit so hard her finger was numb for days.  Second, why in the world would an adult take a turtle (a big one at that) to a grocery store and push it around uncontained in a shopping cart?  <a href="http://sdominick.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Sharon</a>, have you ever taken your turtle shopping with you???  I can't ever imagine taking the frogs with me!  I'd laugh if I ever saw that!<br /><br />Well, that's about it for now.  I think I'm going to visit my friend Chrissie tonight.  I can't remember whether or not I blogged about it, but she was able to leave the hospital last Wednesday.  Her mom is staying at her condo for a while to help Chrissie out.  She's started her speech therapy.  Right now she's relearning basic grammar.  She has to look at sentences and pick out which words are verbs, which are nouns, etc.  She said she's reading at a 4th grade level right now.  It's so sad.<br><br>

I had a wonderful drive home from my parents' house tonight.  Why was it so wonderful?  I-670 is FINALLY open again.  That's definitely the quickest way to get to their house, as well as home from their house.  For the past two years (or however long they've been working on it), I've had to go through downtown, and that's really not much fun.  Now I get to bypass all of that.  It really is nice.<br /><br />I didn't do much today.  I was off work to take my mom for some blood tests and stuff.  Just routine stuff, but she gets stressed because they've been having trouble drawing blood.  Guess her veins are difficult to see, and therefore they do a lot of poking to find them.  Doesn't sound like fun.  <br /><br />I did go to K-Mart, and bought some more Halloween decorations.  I didn't need anymore, but I couldn't resist.  Halloween is definitely my favorite holiday.  It's really the only one I decorate for.  Anyway, I got some automated bone windchimes that jiggle and light up, a screaming wall thing, and a crawling hand.  I've been playing with them all night.  I also decided to dig my other Halloween decorations out of the closet.  I'm not putting them up yet, I just want to have them ready so I can start decorating on October 1st.  My closets are the messiest areas of my house, so digging the decorations out was quite a chore.  But I succeeded, and now I can play with those decorations too :)  I found some finger shaped taper candles that &quot;bleed&quot; red wax when they are burning...I bought them last year during the after Halloween sales, I can't wait to burn them!  I need to get to Garden Ridge sometime soon, they usually have cool decorations too.  <br><br>

My day was rather uneventful.  The most &quot;exciting&quot; thing that happened to me was stepping on a piece of broken glass around 6:40PM this evening.  Really, exciting isn't a good word to describe that, &quot;painful&quot; or &quot;messy&quot; would be much more fitting adjectives.  I have no idea where the little chunk of glass came from since I haven't broken any glassware lately (I even checked to make sure I didn't see any broken glassware I didn't know about), but I sure was able to find it.  The pain really wasn't unbearable or anything, but it did sting.  When I lifted my left foot to see what was wrong, I noticed blood on the floor.  As you can imagine, I wasn't very happy.  Not only did I have a hurt foot, but I had to mop the kitchen floor...mopping isn't one of my favorite chores.  Yes, I could have simply wiped the blood off the floor, but I border on being a neat freak so that wasn't good enough.  Anyway, the cut on the bottom of my foot isn't very bad.  In fact, you can hardly see it.  But it must have been deep, it seemed to bleed for an eternity.  <br /><br />Enough about my foot.  My day at work flew by again today.  I'm definitely not complaining about that.  A guy from Life and Health Systems came up to my desk this morning to install some software I need for the training presentation I'm doing for my team next week.  Since the training is about the how to use the software he installed I sort of needed it on my system :)  He installed the current version, as well as the first release of the new version he's working on.  It looks like it'll be really cool!  Pat is also a tester, so I asked if he worked on developing the software here or at work.  Since he's using it at work, I sort of thought he might work on it there.  Turns out he works on it at home though, which made me laugh!  I didn't get to call him a geek though, he admitted to it before I had a chance :)  My friends and family call ME a geek for spending so much time on the site...however, at least the site is about something fun, I'm not spending my free time working on testing software.  Really though, it's cool that he enjoys it so much.  I say people should be able to do whatever makes them happy and not get called a geek for doing it! <br /><br />This afternoon a few of my coworkers and I were talking about activities we were involved in while we were in high school (I don't even remember how the subject came up though!).  It was a very amusing conversation.  Everyone is going to bring in photos from their high school days to share, that will be even more amusing!<br /><br />Well, that's all I can think of for now.  Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting!<br><br>

OK, I admit that I am a geek for being so excited about this, BUT...<br /><br />I added a <a href="http://www.graveaddiction.com/phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">message board</a> to the site.  And it actually works!  I'd been thinking about adding one for some time now.  However, I thought I'd probably have to host it through a third party since I wasn't sure I could configure a script to work.  But I was able to download a script from <a href="http://www.phpbb.com" target="_blank">PhpBB.com</a>, upload all the files, change the permissions, and set up the forums with no problems at all!  So yeah, the message board is exciting, but me getting it to work is definitely the most exiciting part.<br /><br />Do any of you think 74.7 F is cold?  That's the temperature at work right now (with my fan blowing towards the digital thermometer).  I personally don't think that is cold at all, I keep the temperature in my house set at about 70-72F.  I think it's comfortable at my desk right now.  I'm asking because there are a couple people who think it's always freezing in here!  Then they ask for the temperature to be adjusted and it gets about 10 degrees hotter.  Ugh, one of these days I'll end up having heat stroke in here, but at least those few &quot;always cold&quot; people will be comfortable.<br><br>

I itch so bad today...I was attacked by mosquitoes this weekend!!  I was exploring a cemetery during the day, and I didn't wear any insect repellent...I never do when I go to cemeteries during the day.  There was also no standing water around the cemetery since it was pretty dry last week.  Anyway, I was taking photos when I felt them bite my arm...then they started biting my face...then they got under my jeans and were biting my legs!  There were mosquitoes EVERYWHERE!  I waved my arms frantically to keep them away, but it was no use.  I ran back to the safety of my truck.  Thankfully most of the bites aren't as swollen today as they were yesterday, and the one that was right under my eye is totally gone.  But the bites that are left itch terribly!<br /><br />I changed my site this weekend.  Instead of being red and black it's now gray and black.  It seemed like almost every ghost site I went to was either red and black, green and black, or blue and black.  I'm sure there are plenty of gray and black ghost sites too, but this is a nice change for me.  It took an eternity to update all of the pages, I had over 300 to update!  I also have three cemeteries to add to the site.  I wanted to do that with the color scheme update, but I ran out of time.  Perhaps I'll add the new pages tonight or tomorrow night.  <br /><br />This weekend is the Ghost Hunt at Prospect Place.  It's similar to the <a href="osr.html">Ohio State Reformatory</a> ghost hunt.  It's an all night thing, and you can bring all of your ghost hunting equipment with the exception of ouija boards.  The house is currently being renovated, it's a big mansion that was a stop on the Underground Railroad.  I'm excited about the hunt, they usually see lots of interesting things!<br /><br />I can't think of anything else to blog about right now, and besides, I need to get back to work.  Today has been going by fast, hopefully the rest of my day will go by just as fast!!<br><br>

I'm really enjoying these free features blogger just gave everyone!  I'll have to try the &quot;upload file&quot; thing sometime.  And I can't wait to use the spellcheck!!!<br /><br />Yesterday was the &quot;Thanks a Million&quot; celebration at work.  Upper management (like president and VP level) threw a big party for everyone in my building to celebrate Life and Individual Annuities passing the 1 million customer mark.  They set up tents in the parking lot, had free food (including Graeter's ice cream...mmmmmmmmm!), and reps from some of the fund houses we work with were there.  The fund houses gave away some pretty cool things.  Of course, I missed out on a lot of the freebies since my area didn't get scheduled for the celebration until 1:00.  I did get one of those battery operated personal fans though from the Janus booth.  I'll definitely be able to use that at work, it's always soooo hot at my desk! I can't believe anyone could think the area I sit in is cold, but there are always a few people who complain about freezing.  I'll probably have a heat stroke one of these days.  Anyway, now I'm rambling :)<br /><br />I talked to Chrissie, the friend who had the stroke and open heart surgery, on the phone last night.  She's been moved to the other hall now.  She said there's a chance she may get to go home before the 2 weeks is up. She sounded more like her old self...she's still having trouble forming sentences, but she laughed as much as she did before the surgery.  The main reason she called though was not to tell me about moving to the other hall...one of her nurses is my old roommate!!  The one I kicked out back in March 2001!!  I never dreamed that Chrissie would even run into her there, let alone have her as a nurse.  Too funny.  Wonder if I'll run into her when I visit???  This roommate was one of my best friends in high school, so I don't dislike her as a person, but she was the most disgusting, filthiest person I have ever lived with.  God, I have TONS of horror stories I could tell!  I don't know how my blog makes me seem, but in real life I'm a rather quiet, easy going, non-confrontational person.  I hate arguments.  Well, Abby pushed me too far, and I blew up.  That's how everyone knew she REALLY pushed me too far...I almost never get mad and yell at people!  Then I started receiving rather amusing hate mail from some of her family members.   I hadn't read them for a long time, but since all of the horrible memories came flooding back with Chrissie's news, I found an e-mail from one of her brothers (a 20 year old).  Here it is for your reading enjoyment (and so you can see what I had to put up with!):<br /><br /><blockquote><i> Hey, now that I've gotten you to open this message, I will comence with the outright disgust I have for your kind. It must be really easy for you to make fun of Abby and hurt her feelings, being that she is the nicest girl in <br />the world and would never do a thing to hurt a soul. You don't see that though, all you see is someone you hate for obviously stupid and self absorbed reasons. I once thought you were a nice person, but now I just look at you as the devil, reencarnated as a childish (but big)joke, subject to public ridicule. The countdown to freedom will deffinatley come when my sister breaks the chains of the backed up toilet that is Beth *Removed for Privacy*. Countdown to freedom, how retarded and kidlike can a woman in her twenties get, no more than you I think. I am writting this under my own demand for peace of mind in my sisters life.<br /><br />    I also hope you show this message to all your friends at work, this way <br />they will all know what a big, ugly loser you are. If you even have friends, which I doubt, who would want to be friends with someone who always wears black t-shirts and will turn their back on you by kicking you on your ass. <br /><br />Well its been great. Write back if you want, I'd love to hear what you have <br />to say.<br />     J.C.<br /><br />P.S.- Is everyone at nationwide as retarded as you? Are they all black t-shirt wearing withches? </i></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, I guess my reasons were &quot;stupid and self absorbed&quot; for asking her to move out.  I mean really, was living with a girl who put moldy towels in the linen closet, didn't flush the toilets regularly, ate moldy food, broke glass without cleaning it up so I could step on it (on multiple occasions), never cleaned ANYTHING, etc all that bad?  Yes, I am being totally sarcastic!  Living with her was pure hell.  I was so extremely happy when she moved out and I could live in a mold-free apartment :)  My coworkers were sort of sad though, they really missed me coming into work all pissed off with another &quot;living with Abby&quot; horror story.  But entertaining my coworkers wasn't a good enough reason to keep her as a roommate. <br /><br />Oh, and since I would seem bad for not mentioning anything about 9/11...I noticed that a lot of people have been writing about where they were on 9/11/2001, so I'm going to do the same.  I was at work, I sat on the 25th floor in Nationwide Plaza 3 downtown (and let me add, I still miss working downtown!).  The company had just sent out a mass e-mail to all of the downtown associates about stopping the shuttle buses that took people to the a few of the parking lots.  Well, several dumbasses kept hitting the &quot;reply to all&quot; button and sent out these crazy e-mails to everyone on the list.  It was getting a bit ridiculous.  I was over at Michelle's desk and we were laughing about this e-mail situation.  Saundra, another coworker, came over and interrupted us.  She had just heard that a plane crashed into the first WTC tower.  We thought it must be a joke.  Our coworker Brenda had a little battery operated TV, so we went over to her desk.  The news about the WTC attack was all over stations, and while we were watching we saw the second plane hit the other tower.  Everyone kind of freaked out.  We went over to the windows and saw the police blocking off the street in front of our building (it's close to a couple federal buildings), and I though that made it seem even more frightening.  The company let all of us leave around 11-11:30 that morning.  It really was a sad day, and I'm sure none of us will forget it.  However, I am tired of seeing the news stations showing the footage over and over and over and over and over this morning!<br /><br />Well, it's time for me to get to work :(  Perhaps I'll try to blog again tonight!<br><br>

I feel like I should say this...there's not much time left, but if you read this before the end of the day, go on over to <a href="http://brendoman.com" target="_blank">Brendoman.com</a>, look for the poll on the left hand side of the screen and vote for <a href="http://brendoman.com/houseofslug/" target="_blank">Luis</a>!!<br /><br /><a href="http://graveaddiction.com/blogtronics/" target="_blank">Erik</a> left a comment to last night's post and he asked for the spiced shortbread recipe.  So Erik, here you go:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><ul><br /><li>1 1/4 cup flour<br /><li>1/4 cup brown sugar<br /><li>Approx. 1/8 teaspoon cloves (I used a bit more)<br /><li>Approx. 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br /><li>Approx. 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (I used a bit more)<br /><li>Approx. 1/4 teaspoon cardamon (optional - this was just something I added)<br /><li>1/2 cup butter (I suppose margarine would work too)<br /></ul><br />Sift the dry ingredients together.  Next cut in the butter with a fork until the mixture is clumpy.  Then knead the dough until smooth.  You can roll it to 1/2 inch thin and use a cookie cutter to cut it into rounds, or you can cut it into strips.  Or you can do what I did - the dough it really thick, so I just rolled it into a log shape, like those Pillsbury cookies you can by in the refrigerator section of any grocery store.  Then I sliced it into 1/2 inch thick slices...it worked just fine!  Then bake them for about 20 minutes at 320 degrees on ungreased cookie sheets.  And that's it!  Pretty simple, really.<br /><br />This past weekend my sister bought me an old glass lamp at some store near Marietta, OH.  It's amber, so it matches my furniture!  Have I ever posted a picture of my furniture out here?  Some people think it's hideous, but I really like it.  It's my dad's old furniture, and it's older than me!  It's 30+ years old now, and it's orange, avocado, black, and brown plaid!!!  Since I collect vintage stuff from the 50's-70's it is perfect for me.  Anyway, my sister was really nice for buying me the lamp, she's a wonderful little sister!!  <br /><br />Tonight I was talking to my mom on the phone after I got home from work.  While I was talking to her my doorbell rang.  I had no idea who it could be.  I looked through the peep hole in the door and saw that it was the UPS guy.  I was confused, because the only time I get things shipped UPS is when I buy things on eBay, and even then those things are usually shipped USPS.  Anyway, I opened the door and accepted the package.  I opened it, and it was cookies from my mom!  The card on them said &quot;Happy Ghost Hunting!!!&quot;.  That really made me laugh, my mom said the service rep who took her order thought that message was pretty weird too.  She was ordering cookies for a couple other people, so she decided to send me some too.  What a wonderful Mommoth!<br /><br />OK, I SUCK at altering images, so you've been warned.  But I went ahead and tried to blow up the photo from Nemacolin Castle that I posted out here last night.  I also played around with the brightness, contrast, etc.  So here's the altered images:<br /><br /><center><img src="./nemcas/nemcas11neg.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="./nemcas/nemcas11eq.jpg"><br /><br /><img src="./nemcas/nemcas11large.jpg"></center><br /><br />I still think it looks like a child's ghost.  It's kind of exciting, it's one of the few strange things I've ever caught on film!!!  That's just too exciting!!<br><br>

Going back to work today was tough, but I did manage to survive the day.  Actually, it wasn't bad because it seemed like all I did was update people on Chrissie's surgery and talk about my trip to PA.  Speaking of the trip to PA, I added all of the photos I took to the web last night.  You can see the list of new pages by <a href="newstuff.html">clicking here</a>!  <a href="http://bethiwethie.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Beth</a> (not me, the other one!!) already looked at the photos, and she noticed something strange in one of them.  I noticed the same thing...in one of the pictures from <a href="nemcas.html">Nemacolin Castle</a> (a haunted house in Brownsville, PA) it looks like there is a child's face in one of the windows!  I swear I didn't see anything in that window while I was visiting the castle.  Here's the picture, let me know what you think:<br /><br /><center><img src="./nemcas/nemcas11.jpg"></center><br /><br />I think it looks like a face too.  And the castle is supposed to have at least 10 known ghosts, including a 7 year old girl.  Strange stuff, huh?!<br /><br />Other than that, I don't have much else to talk about.  I was going to go see Chrissie tonight, but I decided not to.  I think I'll wait until she's moved to Dodd Hall, which will probably be tomorrow. The last visit was just too depressing.  And I honestly can't believe that she's had all of those major complications and still thinks this ELECTIVE surgery was worth it!  My friends and I all think she's crazy :)  <br /><br />I did get bored tonight and decided to drink a cup of green tea, even though it's kind of hot outside.  I also decided to make shortbread cookies to have with my tea, since I couldn't talk myself into going to a grocery store to buy some.  I discovered that shortbread cookies are extremely easy to make!  I made spiced ones, with brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cardamom.  They turned out really good, and they were excellent with the tea.  I'll definitely have to make them again.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll probably blog more tomorrow. <br><br>

Guess I should have reminded all of you that I was going to be out of state earlier this week....I couldn't believe how many comments I had!! :)<br /><br />I had a fun time in Pennsylvania.  I was able to see an aunt that I haven't seen in 12-13 years, and I finally got to meet her husband that she married 5 years ago.  I have 6 new cemeteries to add to the site, two haunted houses, and a fort.  I took 353 pictures on the digital camera, and about 35-36 on the 35mm.  I'm working on getting them resized so I can add them to the site.  I'm hoping to have all the new pages out on the site by Monday night, but that might be pushing it.<br /><br />My friend Chrissie, the one who had the blood clots in her lungs, has been having a difficult time.  I got a phone call from my friend Jennifer on Monday night before I left for Uniontown, PA.  She told me that Chrissie was back in the hospital!  She went home last Saturday after the blood clot incident, but on Sunday morning she was back at OSU Med Center.  A blood clot made it's way to her brain and she had a stroke.  She wasn't able to speak, and she was dragging her legs when she walked.  But it gets even worse...I checked my voicemail from the hotel on Tuesday night and had another message from Jennifer.  Turns out the doctors found out she also had a blood clot in her heart and they scheduled open heart surgery for Wednesday at 11:30.  It was really risky since she was on blood thinners from the stroke, but they had no choice.  They also discovered that she had a pre-existing hole in her heart, so they fixed that too.  She was in ICU until last night.  I went to the hospital around 8:30 tonight.  She is able to speak now, but she's still having trouble articulating her thoughts.  Talking to her reminded me of talking to my grandma who had Alzheimer's...I ended up finishing most of Chrissie's sentences.  Her arms are blue, purple, and green from all of the IV's.  She has a big, gigantic IV in her neck since her arms are so bruised up.  She's on two IV blood thinners, and some other IV medicine.  She also had to take a big cup of pills while I was there.  She has a black eye and stitches above her eye from when she passed out in the bathroom last week.  It was a very depressing visit.  She told me she'll be in the hospital for 4 more days for heart surgery recovery, then she'll be in rehab for two weeks in other building.  She'll have 3 months of occupational, speech, and physical therapy.  As if all of that is depressing enough, she's very depressed about not being able to start grad school this quarter.  Plus she was depressed about all of the food commercials on TV that show food she'll never be able to eat again.  She's my age (24) - I can't imagine having bariatric surgery, blood clots in my lungs and legs, a stroke, and open heart surgery in a three week period.  Hopefully she won't have any more problems!!!<br /><br />I dread going to the hospital again.  I got soooooo lost trying to find her room tonight, as well as finding my way back to the parking garage!  I knew her room number, but I didn't know exactly what building she was in.  And I couldn't find anyone to help me find out where to go!!!  Finally a nurse heard me asking one of the doctors for help, and it turns out she knew had just seen Chrissie's name on a room listing.  Thank god she heard me, if not I'd probably still be wandering the halls.  Then I couldn't find my way back to the parking garage...it was a stressful night, that's for sure!<br /><br />Well, I need to get back to resizing photos.  Plus I need to visit all of the blogs I read daily to catch up on everything I've missed! :) <br><br>
