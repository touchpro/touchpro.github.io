On June 10, 2009 I received an e-mail from Bobbie B. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was about 10 or 9 when this happened. Me, my brother Matt, my sister Sam, my friend Dominique, and the neighboorhood kids were in our yard.  My brother, Matt, my sister, Sam, and maybe Dominique were using the ouija board.
<br><br>
We were all watching.
<br><br>
My brother was talking to the ghost for some time (we all thought he was faking it because he sometimes does).  What I remember was the following:
<br><br>
Matt: How did you die?<br>
Board: murder<br>
<br>
Matt/Sam: What and where did it happen?<br>
Board:  no movement<br>
<br>
Right at that second the next door light went on and off, and a scream was coming from the house.  We went on the road after that and talked about it.  We went inside and asked our parents if they heard it too.  They said they didn't.
<br><br>
The next morning, Sam and Dominique asked the lady that owned the house if everything was OK.  The lady said, &quot:Yeah, why?&quot;  Sam and Dominique told her that they heard a scream last night, and the light went on.  The lady said that her kids weren't home last night, and that she was the only one there...and she was sleeping.  She said she didn't hear a thing.
<br><br>
We know our neighborhood is haunted because we live on a Plantation, and there are stories on the internet: Medway Plantation, South Carliona.
