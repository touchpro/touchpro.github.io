On October 9, 2008 I received an e-mail from Angel Smith about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I was playing with my ouija board with a friend of mine one night out at a park beside a pond. We think our session worked so well because we were very close to water, and I heard that water helps because it signifies life and created energy.
<br><br>
We contacted a spirit named Benjamin Todol, but he wanted us to call him Benny. Benny then went on to tell us about his life in pretty great detail - he was 64 at the time of his death, he died in 1951 in a car accident, he was married to a Mary Todol, and they had three children whose daughter was named Penny Penjam. He told us that his favorite food was seafood, that he loved to eat when he was alive, and he also loved sex (haha). We went on to ask him about heaven, and he happily went on to tell us all about it. He explained that heaven wasn't heaven like we think it is, but there are many levels to it. He had to be reincarnated 175 times, and he had already been reincarnated 5 times roughly, and after he had lived all those lives and learned all he had to learn from those life experiences, then he'd move up to the next &quot;rung&quot; in the heaven &quot;ladder.&quot; He explained that there was not just one God in heaven, but there were multiple gods. Some were nice, but some weren't. He explained that some were &quot;full of themselves&quot; and thought they were better than everyone else, mostly because they were so smart. He said the god Aphrodite was even there, and described her in detail and how beautiful she was. He said heaven was just like Earth, except MUCH better. He had actually been supposedly taking a shower before we contacted him. He said he loved taking showers in heaven and would be going back to his shower after we were done with our session. He said he could even see through my clothing, so I asked him if that was so, then what was the shape of the sticker I wore on my hip when I tanned (the lighter outline it makes when you tan in a tanning bed). He even guessed it correctly! That was pretty strange. He went on to tell me that he thought I was a very beautiful woman, and if he had been alive then he would love to date me. He was sad he was deceased. So we playfully flirted and had fun for a while. It was interesting flirting with a deceased old man, but hey, whatever! haha...
<br><br>
He told us about how he had been reincarnated as a tiger once, and how he's once lived in Africa during the time of the Egyptians, and how the aliens had helped build the pyramids and helped the Mayans and Incans. That was pretty cool. Not sure if I believe it, but hey, still intruiging.
<br><br>
He then went on to ask me questions about myself. He asked what I did for a job, and I told him I'm a stripper, and of course he completely LOVED that idea! haha...
<br><br>
He then went on to tell me he would come watch me the next time I worked, and even told me to dance to his fave song &quot;My Humps&quot; by Fergie. I told him I would, haha. He really loved that and couldn't wait to come see me. When I did go work, it was interesting wondering if he was there during that song, haha.
<br><br>
Anyways, that session was pretty cool. He was very talkative and seemed to really enjoy talking to us. He would even go in circles if we asked him to. He would then go in really fast small circles over &quot;Yes&quot; when he really liked soemthing I said. Haha. Well, it was a fun time. I enjoy playing ouija now and will try to contact him again sometime soon.
