On July 26, 2009 I received an e-mail from Sabrina about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

So, it was my friend Christa's 14th birthday party, which was a sleepover on Friday, July 24, 2009. Me, Sabrina, and my friends, Christa, Brittany, Taylor, and Lizzy, were all there. We decided to use the Ouija board to contact the dead. This is what happened:
<br><br>
Us: Is there a presence in this room?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Us: Are you a good presence?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Us: What is your name?<br>
Board: John R----.<br>
<br>
So it went on and on. We figured out John got murdered in Iraq, he was 47, he had a wife and 3 kids, and lots of other information. One of his sons happened to be 13, our age, his name is Steven R----, and he said Steven went to the school one of my friends goes to. I called the friend. I asked if he knew a Steven Rosli, and he replied yes. We couldn't believe it.  After that, we returned to the Ouija board.<br>
<br>
Us: John, are you still there?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Is this a new presence?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Bring John back.<br>
Lizzy started screaming, &quot;Don't say that! it brings bad spirits here!&quot; but we didn't believe her.<br>
<br>
Us: Is this a good presence?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: You have to leave. Goodbye.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: You have to leave now, we are too powerful for you (we were lying so it would leave). Goodbye.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
At this point we were completely freaked out, the spirit would not say goodbye.<br>
<br>
Us: GOODBYE!<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: Do you have to tell us something?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Us: Spell out what you have to tell us.<br>
The board spelled out KILL. Christa and Brittany started to cry.<br>
<br>
Us: GOODBYE!!!<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Us: GOODBYE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE. GOODBYE!<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
We were all completely scared now. We put the Ouija board pointer upside-down on the board and ran upstairs to get holy water that Christa's mom had from a long time ago. We ran back into the basement. I had to perform an excorcism on the board, which was kind of embarassing, but I was the only one who knew how to do it. I knew it was to keep us safe. We were so scared that we broke the Ouija board in seven peices and buried them. My friends and I all wore cross necklaces that night to protect us, but we knew that wouldn't stop the bad spirit from getting to us. We will NEVER play the Ouija board again, ever.
