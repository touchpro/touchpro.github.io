On June 4, 2008 I received an e-mail from Dixie and Karlee about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

On May 28, 2008 at 12:30 P.M. Dixie and I, along with a couple friends, decided to play with the ouija board.  We took the ouija board out to play, and as soon as we took it out, Dixie had uncontrollable shaking.  She demanded that we put it up, inside a case, to get it away from her. So my friend Kayla put it in a tote, drew a cross on it, and put it away.  We all went to bed after that.
<br><br>
The next day, May 29 around 1:30 P.M., we got it back out to play and retry.  Dixie didn't have her shakings.  So we played.  We had successfully contacted 2 spirits: one good and one bad.  The good spirit's name was unknown, and the bad spirit's name was Seth.  He had possessed our friend Kayla.  She could hear his thoughts, and she could see visions too.
<br><br>
Then he was talking to Dixie through the board.  He suddenly got mad at her, and he started banging on the trailer walls.  Kayla could hear him screaming.  We all left a bit after that.
<br><br>
The next day Kayla called us.  She said her kitchen stove started shaking, and cabinets opened by themselves.
<br><br>
We need some answers...why was Dixie shaking, and why was Kayla's stove shaking?
<br><br><br>
If you have any advice/answers for Dixie and Karlee, please <a href="mailto:removedforprivacy">send me an e-mail</a> and I'll forward it on to them.
