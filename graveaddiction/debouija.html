On June 6, 2005 I received an e-mail from Deborah about her super creepy ouija board discussions with a mysterious Mr. W:
<br><br><br>
&quot;I tell you now about the mystery of Mr. W, a spirit who apparently wants me to do him a favor.
<br><br>
One night my one best friends, Robert ,and I were using the ouija, and we had encountered a very powerful spirit who kept saying W T V, and 5 A M. We asked him several questions, he said W T V almost all the time. I don’t
know for sure, but I know at least I got flashbacks that I know sure as hell weren’t mine (I do have a sixth sense, unfortunately, it’s not a pleasant gift, but eh).  Anyhow, I don’t remember too much as of now, but...
<br><br>
I believe he was the father of a little nine year old girl who I previously spoke to.  Apparently it had been her birthday, the doorbell rang during her party, and she went to answer it, thus taken away.  A gift she received for her birthday was a rather expensive, priceless gem or something...I dunno.  We were pretty sure the two guys who took her wanted it, but never realized she had it.  They took her to an old abandoned farmhouse and forced her under a trap door.  The wooden floor had some missing boards so there was at least one ray of light.  She had poor vision, and as it was dark she tripped, chipping a tooth.  Her father, Mr.W, taking things into his own hands found the hideout and assaulted the kidnappers.  Unfortunately, he missed and they got his gun, killed him, made it look like a suicide.  The girl heard it and held herself while the two men left never to return.  She starved to death, and no one’s found her body…but I get the feeling that someone came back and put her under the debris from the broken staircase leading to the room under the trapdoor.
<br><br>
I sobbed as these images came, I never felt like it before...I swear sometimes Mr. W is still around, waiting for me to find her. He at one point did mention something about Washington, but we asked if he meant the state and he said no.&quot;
