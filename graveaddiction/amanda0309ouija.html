On March 9, 2009 I received an e-mail from Amanda J. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I am 23 years old, and I have very recently started playing with a ouija board with my boyfriend. WARNING: one spirit I have contacted used very dirty language! This is a little lengthy, but so interesting! Here is my story.
<br><br>
My boyfriend, Jason, who is now 30, bought a ouija board when he was in high school and hasn't played with it since. He told me when we met that he only used it a few times, and talked to a spirit named Gus years ago. We were talking about ghosts one night, and I had always been curious about the paranormal but never really experienced anything. We decided to get his old board out. We almost immediately made contact with a spirit who identified himself as &quot;Mat,&quot; who said he was 7 years old, and lived in Jason's house with his cat, Mazzy. I was absolutely fascinated by this. We talked to Mat a few times over the next  few days. We then asked the board if we could talk to someone else. This time it spelled out &quot;Gus.&quot; Gus told us that he was Jason's spirt guide, and followed him wherever he went. I asked if I had a spirit guide, and the board said mine was named Sarah.
<br><br>
Over the next few weeks we used the board pretty regularly, and the only spirit that would speak with us was Gus. For whatever reason, no one else would come through.
<br><br>
One night my sister, who is very skeptical, decided to play with us after we came home from the bar (we were all a little tipsy). Here's how it went:
<br><br>
Me: Is anyone here with us?<br>
Board: Yes Gus<br>
<br>
Sister: (laughed) You're moving it!<br>
Me: No we're not! You have to have an open mind if you want to contact anyone!<br>
<br>
Sister: Hey board! Who is my spirit guide?<br>
Board: Kim<br>
<br>
Sister: Can I call her Kimmy?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sister: Can I talk to her?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Sister: Why not, you meanie?!<br>
Board: You are drunk.<br>
<br>
Sister: haha! No, I'm not!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
(The Planchette started jerking really fast between letters)<br>
Board: Stop<br>
<br>
Jason: I think we're making him mad.<br>
Me: Gus, are you mad that we're laughing?<br>
Board: (very quickly) Yes<br>
<br>
Me: We're sorry. Don't be mad at us. She's just joking around.<br>
Board: Do not treat me like that.<br>
<br>
Me: Like what?<br>
Board: A joke.<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
We put the board away for the night. We tried to use the board the next day, only Jason and I, and as soon as we'd try to talk, the pointer would go straight to &quot;goodbye.&quot; About five tries in a row it did that. We were hoping to talk to someone other than Gus, but for some reason I really felt like it was Gus saying goodbye continuously. We decided to try one more time. On a Sunday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Me: Gus, are you here? Please don't say goodbye!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why don't you want to talk to us?<br>
Board: Don't want to<br>
<br>
Me: Why not?<br>
Board: Because<br>
<br>
Me: Why are you the only one who will talk to us? Doesn't anyone want to talk?<br>
Board: I won't let them<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: My board<br>
<br>
Me: Why doesn't Mat talk anymore? He was nice.<br>
Board: I won't let him.<br>
<br>
Me: Why is this your board??<br>
Board: Jason bought it.<br>
<br>
Jason: Is it yours because you're my spirit guide?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Jason: So whoever buys a board, it belongs to their spirit guide?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: What if we made a homemade board? Will you own that one?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, thanks Gus. Goodbye.<br>
Board: Goodbye.<br>
<br>
I thought it was a little ridiculous to make our own board, and I really didn't think it would work at all. But we really wanted to talk with someone new, so we thought we'd give it a try. The only thing I could find to draw on was the back of an old calendar I found in my closet. I copied the layout of the board with a marker on the plain white back on the calendar. We then sat down and attemted our new &quot;board.&quot; This is one of the strangest experiences of my life, and WARNING: this spirit has a dirty mouth! ;).<br>
<br>
Me: We invite any spirits who want to talk to come speak with us.<br>
Me: Is anyone here with me and Jason?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
(We got really excited! We didn't expect it to work)<br>
<br>
Me: Is this Gus?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Me: What is your name?<br>
Board: Matt<br>
<br>
Jason: Is this the Matt from my house?<br>
Board: no<br>
<br>
Jason: Have you ever talked with us before?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jason: Are you a good spirit, Matt?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What do you do that makes you bad?<br>
Board: Kill<br>
<br>
Me: Did you kill people in life?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you kill people now?<br>
Board: Fucking with you<br>
<br>
Me: You were joking about being bad?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like me, Matt?<br>
Board: Yes your tits<br>
<br>
Me: (laughed) You have a dirty mouth, Matt!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jason: Do you have anything you want to tell us?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jason: What?<br>
Board: Watch out<br>
<br>
Jason: For what?<br>
Board: I will fuck with you<br>
<br>
Me: Will you harm us in any way, Matt?<br>
Board: No messing<br>
<br>
Me: You are messing with us again?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Jason: Anything else you want to say?<br>
Board: yes<br>
<br>
Jason: What?<br>
Board: Jason Fuck her<br>
<br>
Me: You want us to have sex?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Board: To watch<br>
<br>
Me: I don't want you watching!<br>
Board: You are hot.<br>
<br>
Me: Did you get a lot of girls in your life?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How old were you when you died?<br>
Board: 20<br>
<br>
Me: That's young! How did you die?<br>
Board: Car accident<br>
<br>
Me: When did you lose your virginity?<br>
Board: 15<br>
<br>
Me: Were you really hot?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: How'd you get girls then?<br>
Board: Big dick<br>
<br>
Me: (laughed) Do you have sex in the afterlife?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why not?<br>
Board: No dick<br>
<br>
Me: When you die you don't have genitals?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Are you happy?<br>
Board: Very<br>
<br>
Me: Are you in heaven?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: Where are you?<br>
Board: Here<br>
<br>
Me: How did you get here?<br>
Board: You asked for me<br>
<br>
Me: Oh, I invited you. Were you in heaven when I invited you?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Will you move something so we know you're here?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: When?<br>
Board: soon<br>
<br>
Me: What are you going to move?<br>
Board: not telling<br>
<br>
Me: How about that necklace hanging on my doorknob? That should be easy for you to move.<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Me: What is your last name Matt?<br>
Board: Deitrich<br>
<br>
Me: Can I call you Fucker since you like talking dirty?<br>
Board: Sure Fucker<br>
<br>
(Jason kissed me when I was laughing)<br>
Me: Is Jay a good kisser, Fucker?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jason: Hey! That's not true!<br>
Board: You are getting hard<br>
<br>
Jason: (laughed) Yes I am.<br>
Board: Fuck<br>
<br>
Me: Can we talk to you in a few minutes, Fucker?<br>
Board: Yes Bye Fucker<br>
<br>
Ok, so since Matt was talking about sex so much, me and Jason ended up doing it a little later in the day in my room. I was getting dressed and could not find my underwear anywhere. I looked all over my room, they were nowhere to be found. I didn't think anything of it and we went back to the board:<br>
<br>
Me: Hey, is Matt still here?<br>
Board: Fucker<br>
<br>
Me: Hey Fucker! Did you see what was going on in here?<br>
Board: Yes Awesome<br>
<br>
Me: You are sick to watch us, you know!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to move anything while we go to lunch?<br>
Board: I did<br>
<br>
Me: What did you move?<br>
Board: Panties<br>
<br>
Me: (forgetting I even lost them) Oh my God! I did lose them! Where are they, Matt?<br>
Board: on the floor<br>
<br>
(I looked to my right and there they were, right in front of me. They were not there before, I was sure of that.)<br>
<br>
Me: Ok Fucker, thanks for moving something and talking. Can we talk to you later?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, bye!<br>
Board: Goodbye<br>
<br>
This was the strangest experience of my life! I couldn't believe we got all those messages on a piece of paper drawn on with marker. And to detect such a strong personality and sense of humor was so fascinating to me. Thanks for letting me share my story!
