On October 14, 2006 I received an e-mail from Mike Hudy about his interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
My three friends and I were sitting down at this one kid's house on Friday the thirteenth (yesterday).  We decided that we wanted something spooky to happen, so two of my friends started to talk about ghosts and how they believe in spirits and what not.  My other friend and I did not believe them at all. So, to prove to them that spirits don't exist, we decided to go buy an ouija board at Walmart before midnight so we could go to cemeteries and try to awaken spirits.  While at those places nothing happened.  My one friend who didn't believe at all wasn't taking it serious at all.
<br><br>
Later we went back to his house and he fell asleep.  My other two friends and I then decided to try again.  We turned out all the lights and lit candles to set the mood.  After about an hour of nothing we were going to give up.  We all took our hands off the game board, and it then spelled out hello on its own.  We then asked the name of the spirit...it spelled out 'with right hand'.  We couldn't figure out what it meant, so then we decided to ask how old he was.  It spelled out 'don't worry'.  We asked if he was good, and it spelled 'you know'...then out of nowhere the radio came on to a fuzzy channel, and we all got a little startled so we decided to stop playing.
<br><br>
We turned on the lights and sat down.  The lights then went out and it spelled out 'no keep talking'.  Then we said goodbye, and it refused to let us go.  We asked why we had to keep talking...it responded with 'you must'.  We asked why, and it said death...after a little while we just let it go as the game piece was circling the board and we tried to ignore it.  About ten minutes later we heard a loud crash in the other room.  As we walked in to see what happened, the friend who was sleeping was standing by the turned over coffee table.  We asked him what he did, and he said he didn't do anything.  We walked back into the room with the ouija board, and it was spelling out 'told you'.  Then the sleeping kid began to believe too.  We asked it why it wouldn't leave us alone and it responded with 'I can't'.  We asked why, and then the lights came back on and the board stopped.  We then figured it out - he meant the right hand man.  We were really scared and don't recommend using these boards...we threw it under the one kid's bed, and everynight we can hear it moving!
