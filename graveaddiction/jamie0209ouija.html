On February 13, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jamie T. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I have always been interested in the paranormal, so investigating the works of the infamous Ouija board seemed inevitable. Shortly before using it for the first time, I spent massive amounts of time online, researching all the dangers and tips; I wanted to do it right. When I eventually happened upon your site, my interests peaked and I decided it was time. I had read that first time uses shouldn't be done alone, so I called upon my two sisters to use it with me. Even though they were both reluctant, they caved.
<br><br>
The very, very first use was with a homemade board and a shot glass, shortly after midnight. Nothing happened. The next morning, my Mother actually admitted to having an unopened board from some flea market in her closet, and gave it to us to use. We took it into my younger sister's bedroom and set it up, between the two of us, with my older sister recording the happenings on a notepad. We sat patiently for about half an hour, asking questions, but no one responded. During the session, we had heard some bumps and taps in the room, but none of us figured it was a direct result of the board. We eventually gave up and put the board away.
<br><br>
That night, the entire family heard my brother (who is autistic) sobbing in his bedroom. He hadn't sobbed like that - or cried, ever, really - since our grandmother died over a decade ago. He began freaking out and while my parents calmed him down, my sisters and I were a little paranoid. Still, it wasn't enough to convince us that we had somehow contacted someone/something from &quot;the other side.&quot;
<br><br>
The very next night, all of us confessed to feeling... not quite right since we had used the board. I had a terrible sleep, as did my older sister, but the worst was yet to come for my younger sister. She has a severe nut allergy (can you see where this is going?), and hadn't had a scare since she was very young. My Mother (who buys the groceries) has always been incredibly careful when it comes to ingredients, and yet somehow, she served us all a PECAN cheesecake that night. My sister took two bites, spat it out (sensing there was some kind of nut in it - smart girl) and immediately ran out the door with my Dad, who drove her to the hospital. By the time we were even allowed to see her, she was still high as a kite on all the drugs because the doctors had to completely knock out her respiratory system and have machines breathing for her. They said that had we waited another second, she would've died right there in the ambulance. &quot;She almost died,&quot; were his exact words. The whole ordeal sent chills up my spine for days.
<br><br>
The next night, with my sister still in the hospital, both my older sister and I felt &quot;under attack&quot; by something we didn't quite understand. At one point, I was wearing a heating pad to relive some muscle pains, and a random glass of water I had never seen before suddenly fell all over the wire. I was so freaked out by the idea of being electrocuted that I threw the thing off of me and never picked it up again. Later that night, my Mother came into the kitchen and asked, &quot;Is someone cooking something?&quot; We all replied no, and that's when she told us that the broiler was on full-blast. No one had even used the oven that day.
<br><br>
I can't say for certain that we unleashed an evil force in our house, but I do know that once my Dad yelled at it to go away, none of us have had any issues since. And we have certainly not used the Ouija board ever again.
