On May 7, 2008 I received an e-mail from Thomas A. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
We were at my friend David's house because he was having a sleepover. It was around midnight when he pulled out his glow in the dark board and said let's play. We were all skeptical, and I told them that I'd watch. We headed downstairs to the living room, locked the door, and set up three candles, although we only lit one.
<br><br>
They were messing around asking questions and laughing, not taking it serious, and for a split second and I saw something like a hand touch one of my friend's shoulders. I was going to say something, but didn't because I thought I was seeing things. About half an hour later they asked a spirit to show itself, and I heard Michelle say that it wasn't a good idea but they asked anyways. Just then the two unlit candles lit themselves, and I heard David say, very funny Thomas. I told them that it wasn't me, and it's impossible for me to light two candles at the same time. Michelle was getting scared and David insisted that they continued to play. I heard Robert say that they should stop because he was getting a bad feeling, yet David wanted to go on.
<br><br>
David asked a spirit to show itself again, and it said wait till 3. So they just sat there and continued to play, and I was just wondering why it said to wait. Michelle then asked a question, I don't remember what she asked, but the board told us to quit playing and close the board. David said that we were a bunch of chickens and convinced us to continue to play. I offered to take Michelle's place and she was grateful. Around 3 AM, we heard the door unlock itself, starting with the chain on the top and working its way to the bottom...it went very slowly, we all got scared, especially David.  We were frozen in fear, just watching the door get unlocked, one by one. The last lock started to turn, and I grabbed the pointer and moved it to goodbye, flipped it over, and just threw the board across the room.  Michelle turned on the lights. David went to lock the door again, and he could see scratch marks all over the locks. We stayed up the entire night scared to go to sleep.
