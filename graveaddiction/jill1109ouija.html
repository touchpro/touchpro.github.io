On November 21, 2009 I received an e-mail from Jill about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

On November 21, 2009 a few of us used the Ouija Board at Jill's house. We decided to use an online &quot;Magical Talking Board.&quot; This session lasted 1 hour and 35 minutes.
<br><br>
Lauren: Are you female?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: This is scary<br>
<br>
Lauren: You've got to remember these were once real people like us, a guy in my class played it and he got freaked out because he said &quot;where are you?&quot; and it said &quot;near water&quot; and there was a bottle of water beside him.<br>
<br>
Jill: They feed of your souls.<br>
<br>
Lauren: They feed off your nervous energy, this board isn't as bad as the real ones, and if you're nervous it goes crazy.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you female?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you evil?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Oh crap! It's evil!<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill are talking at this point about the &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; movie)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you in Heaven?<br>
<br>
Jill: Of course it's in Heaven.<br>
<br>
Lauren: But it says it's evil.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you hate me?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Knew that was coming.<br>
<br>
Jill: Why do you hate her? I bet it's saying &quot;I hate you.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Jill says this in a pretend evil voice)<br>
<br>
Lauren: How many living people in this house?<br>
Board: 9<br>
<br>
(There were 3 living people in the house)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you have a husband?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Aww! That's sad!<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill are talking at this point again)<br>
<br>
Jill: Ask it if it's lonely.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Ok, in a minute.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you lonely?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Oh my God! I am psychic!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you want to find love?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Oh my God! It doesn't usually answer to questions like that!<br>
<br>
Jill: Aww! That's a shame...<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you have any children?<br>
Board: Leave me now<br>
<br>
Lauren: Aww...it's getting all emotional.<br>
<br>
Jill: We better just leave it now, it's getting emotional; ask it now if it wants us to leave it now.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you want to be left alone?<br>
Board: Cannot tell<br>
<br>
Jill: I was watching Michael Jackson's search for his spirit...<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill are talking at this point again)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you know Michael Jackson?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Oh my God!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you talk to Michael Jackson?<br>
Board: Maybe later<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill are talking at this point again)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you like Jill Munn?<br>
<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: I'll kill you, set you on fire, then I'll hear you scream and...then I'll die.<br>
<br>
(Lauren laughs)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you like Lauren Wales?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Lauren: No one likes me.<br>
<br>
(Lauren talks to Jill about a previous experience with the board)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you...<br>
<br>
Jill: Like chocolate<br>
<br>
Lauren: Yeah!<br>
<br>
Jill: No, no!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you like death?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Right on! I worship you, you like death...I like death!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you know my name?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Your kinda freaking me out, I'm getting freaked out but it's cool at the same time.<br>
<br>
Jill: What's that noise?<br>
<br>
Lauren: It's bagpipes!<br>
<br>
Jill: Thank God for that, it's just bagpipes!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Why are there bagpipes in the dark and the rain?<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you like the dark?<br>
<br>
Lauren: It'll say yes...<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill hear bagpipes and singing)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Oh it's just from dad watching the TV!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you have grey hair?<br>
<br>
Jill: Don't ask that!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Yeah!<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Ask it if it's an old emo.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you an emo?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Dammit!<br>
<br>
Jill: Are you a Goth? Try that!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you a Goth, should I say gothic or Goth?<br>
<br>
Jill: Goth's better!<br>
v
Lauren: Are you a Goth?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you a skater, are you a nerd, are you a geek, are you popular?<br>
<br>
Jill: Are you a punk?<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you a punk?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
(Jill does a victory dance, which scares Lauren more than the board)<br>
<br>
Jill: I'll kill you.<br>
<br>
(Jill was speaking to Lauren at this point)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are my shoes pink?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Lauren: Oh my God!<br>
<br>
(Lauren and Jill scream as Lauren bought new pink high heels today)<br>
<br>
Jill: Stop! You'll make it nervous!<br>
<br>
Jill: You forgot to put the sneezing part in!<br>
<br>
(Jill sneezes)<br>
<br>
Jill: Ask what colour my shoes are.<br>
<br>
(Lauren clicks something by accident, and the board goes off. Jill gets freaked out and thinks there is now a ghost in her house)<br>
<br>
Jill: I've got a ghost in my house now, thanks to you!<br>
<br>
Lauren: It's ok, I did that before...<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are you still there?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Lauren, you are a complete idiot!<br>
<br>
Lauren: It's ok, it's worse if it's the real board...<br>
<br>
Lauren: Are Jill's shoes yellow?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jill: Oh my God! That thing's psychic!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Is it true that that are no spirits in this house?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Yes, thank God!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Does that mean there are spirits in this house or there aren't?<br>
<br>
Jill: Yes, it means no there isn't...oh wait, she's saying there are!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Does this house contain any spirits?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Thank you, thank you.<br>
<br>
(Lauren clicks something by accident and the board goes off)<br>
<br>
Lauren: Oh crap!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Does my house contain any spirits?<br>
Board: Unknown<br>
<br>
Lauren: So, that doesn't mean no...<br>
<br>
Lauren: Which is bad, I knew that anyway!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you know Fred?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
(Jill laughs)<br>
<br>
Lauren: I'll ask it if it knows Bob the Builder...<br>
<br>
Jill: But Bob the Builder is a cartoon.<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you know Bob the Builder?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jill: Can I ask you a question?<br>
<br>
Lauren: What?<br>
<br>
Jill: I'll type it in now!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Ok, my fingers are sore and in cramp.<br>
<br>
Jill: Don't look!<br>
<br>
Lauren: I need to look!<br>
<br>
Jill: It's going to be embarrassing!<br>
<br>
Lauren: I don't care...<br>
<br>
Jill: Do you know Sweeny Todd?<br>
<br>
Lauren: You spelled it wrong!<br>
<br>
Jill: What!? Oh no, I disgraced you!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Ha! You disgraced him!<br>
<br>
Jill: Do you know Sweeney Todd?<br>
Board: Ask later<br>
<br>
Lauren: Do you want to just end it there and send it in?<br>
<br>
Jill: Yeah!<br>
<br>
Lauren: Goodbye
