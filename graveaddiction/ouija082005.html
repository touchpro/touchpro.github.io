On August 12, 2005 I met up with Donna and T.C. at <a href="malabar.html">Malabar Farm State Park</a>.  Later that evening at their campsite, we decided to try and contact some spirits using the 1920's ouija board.  This was the first of three ouija sessions that took place that night.  It was the longest at 65 minutes, 44 seconds.
