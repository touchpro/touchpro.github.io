On November 10, 2007 I received an e-mail from Jennifer H. about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Ouija boards are legit...I SWEAR!
<br><br>
So my neighbors made a ghetto ouija board out of paper.  Katie, Kylie, Kita, and I got curious and went in to see if it was legit or not.  Kylie and Kita peaced out cause they thought it was lame.  Katie put her hand on the thingie and thought that it seemed like the girl was pushing it.  So whatev! I decide to ask them something they know NOTHING about...my life! So this is how it went down:
<br><br>
I asked: Do you know *****?<br>
The Board responds: last name<br>
<br>
Me: ***********<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How is he doing?<br>
Board: He is hurt<br>
<br>
Me: Hurt..How?<br>
Board: Rotator Cuff<br>
<br>
Me: In his shoulder?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How did he hurt it?<br>
Board: Sports<br>
<br>
Me: He got hurt in sports in high school...did he hurt it again?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Board: Hiking<br>
<br>
Me: Does his mom know?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Is he going to graduate late because of it?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How late?<br>
Board: One week<br>
<br>
Me: How does he feel about me?<br>
Board: He loves you<br>
<br>
Me: Will he ask me to marry him when he gets back like people think he will?<br>
Board: Its in the letter<br>
<br>
Me: Thank you<br>
Board: Your welcome<br>
<br>
*Katie and I leave room*
<br><br>
So me being me..I haven't talked to his mom for a while, so I called her!  She heard from him last a few weeks ago. She confirmed the injury and said he is graduating the 4th, which I found strange because my padre talked to his recruiter a few days ago and he said the 11th (WHICH IS ONE WEEK LATER!). I still have no letter and am doubtful if it will come! But the fact that the girl running the board knows nothing about my life (I don't know if she knows my name?!?!) and almost all of what the board said is true! What the heck?
<br><br>
I will never play with an ouija board again, and don't recommend you do because it is freaky!   But it is legit!
