Mom called this morning and said that Sammie and Max (two of my parents' dogs) are now best friends.  When they first brought Max home, Sammie wanted nothing to do with the new puppy.  Now they run together outside (while Oscar watches - he doesn't enjoy running) and last night they laid together on the floor.  <br /><br />Ah, the adventures of life with wiener dogs...last night mom was cleaning, and she moved this little fig tree that sits on the floor so she could clean around it.  When she turned to move it back, she noticed that Max was starting to hike his leg on it!  She yelled "no" at him, and she said that he looked at her as if saying "What?  This is what dogs do!".  That made mom laugh, she said it was difficult to enforce the rule of no peeing on plants in the house while she was laughing so hard!<br /><br />My parents gave me one of those mousepads that you can put a picture in, I guess they were handing them out at the downtown offices last week.  Since I have so many pictures of my frogs around my desk I decided to put something different in the mouse pad...so I selected one of my favorite black and white pictures that I took at <a href="brightbw.html">Bright Cemetery</a>.  I wonder if anyone will notice?  I wonder if anyone will think I'm strange?  Nevermind, I'm sure my coworkers already think that! :)<br /><br><br>

This past Friday my sister bought me a gift from World Market:<br /><br /><center><img src="eyegoo.jpg"></center><br /><br />Yes, my sister bought me slime...but not just any slime, she bought me <a href="http://www.basicfun.com/products/genProductsList.asp?NodeName=goo%20and%20putty">Eyeballs 'n Goo</a>.  Eyeballs 'n Goo is special to me, because it reminds me of my senior year high school English class.  That may seem strange, but here's the story.  Chrissie, the friend I mentioned about a week and a half ago when I was talking about the opera, was in the same English class.  I believe it was our third period class, but that's really not important.  Chrissie carried her backpack with her to all of her classes.  She had her books and other class supplies in that backpack, but she also carried lots of fun things: silly putty, play doh, whiteout (that's another story!) and of course eyeballs 'n goo.  Everyday in English she would select one of these fun things and <s>annoy us</s> entertain us by playing with them during class.  One day she decided to play with her eyeballs 'n goo.  She cleared off a space on her desk, which was to my left, and let the goo run all over her desk.  Part of it even started to drip off the edge.  Well, to see the chalkboard I had to look to my left, and most of the time I kind of sat sideways in my desk.  And since I have big feet, my feet were located right under the edge of her desk.  I was wearing my favorite red shoes that day, so you can only imagine how angry I was when I noticed that I had green goo that had dripped off her desk on my shoes!!  Chrissie laughed and laughed and laughed about it.  Which didn't make me any less angry!  Anyway, I always think of Chrissie and my red shoes when I see eyeballs 'n goo.  Maybe I need to go to World Market and buy a jar for her...but I have new goo-free red shoes now, maybe I shouldn't get her a jar of eyeballs 'n goo!!  I want to keep these shoes safe!<br /><br />Tonight I started my search for a new artificial Christmas tree.  I didn't find anything I liked at Garden Ridge, but I didn't go anyplace else to continue my search.  I don't know what's wrong with me, I just don't feel festive!  The thought of continuing my quest for the tree just depresses me, so I think I may wait until after Christmas to find a new tree.  I'm going to put up the old one that fell over last year, but instead of pushing all of the ugly branches to the front to make it look fuller like I did last year I'm going to try something else...tinsel.  I'm not a big fan of tinsel, but I think it may help close the gaps between the branches without weighting down one side of the tree.  I think I'll try doing that this weekend.  My worst fear is that I'll get it all decorated and it will fall over just like it did last year.  But I'll try to keep positive.<br /><br />I just looked outside...it's been snowing all evening, and it's cold enought that it's sticking to the grass and trees.  It looks so pretty!  Hopefully it's not sticking to the roads!<br><br>

Before I write about anything else, I need to write about Max (so I don't offend my mom even more).  This weekend my parents bought me a new "brother", a 10 month old wiener dog that they named Maximus...or Max for short.  He's a cute little guy, and I posted about five pictures of him on the <a href="wienerpictures1.html">Wiener Dog Pictures</a> page.  Here's one of my favorite pictures of him:<br /><br /><center><img src="./weinerdawgs/max02.jpg"><br><i>Katy holding Max</i></center><br /><br />In addition to adding new <a href="wienerpictures1.html">wiener dog pictures</a> to the site, I also made quite a few other updates:<br /><ol><br /><li>Added pictures of the haunted lace to the site.  Only two pictures had anything that could be considered ghostly in them.  But I wasn't really expected to see anything show up...I read that ghosts are just like living people - some like to have their picture taken and others don't.  Since we're talking about my family (who hates pictures!) I'm 100% sure that these ghosts do not want their pictures taken! :)  But you can <a href="lace.html">click here</a> to see the pictures.<br /><li>Added a new picture of my parents to the <a href="family_friends.html">Family and Friends</a> page.  Sorry guys, had to add it.  But at least I didn't make it the very first picture in the dropdown list!  <br /><li>Added new pictures to the <a href="nature.html">Smeck Park</a> page.  There are some rather good pictures of the autumn leaves.<br /><li>Added new black and white photo to the <a href="mywtf.html">My White's Tree Frogs</a> page.<br /><li>Added new black and white photos to the <a href="mypacman.html">My Pacman Frogs</a> page.<br /><li>Added new <a href="brightbw.html">Black and White Photos from Bright Cemetery</a> page.<br /><li>Added new <a href="basil.html">Basil Memorial Cemetery</a> page.<br /></ol><br />I still need to add the new cemetery pages and lace page to the site navigation bar, but since it's getting late I'll wait until tomorrow to tackle that.  <br /><br />Mark stopped by tonight, I helped him print Christmas cards for his mom.  We talked about a lot, and as usual we talked about all of the hilarious moments we've shared.  Maybe tomorrow night I'll write about those moments which include "the sneeze", "is that blood?", and "don't worry, the rug will hold that box down"!<br /><br />But now I need to go and pack my lunch for tomorow so I don't end up eating in the cafeteria again!<br><br>

I finished taking pictures inside my apartment this weekend, but I didn't get a chance to develop them.  Maybe I'll do that tonight...I can't wait to see if anything strange shows up in them!  Really, the only major ghost related thing that happened this weekend was on Friday night.  I went Christmas shopping with my sister after work.  When we got back to my place we watched TV for awhile.  I heard something outside, so I went to see what was going on.  Turned out it was just one of my neighbor's cars.  Then I turned around and noticed that the bathroom door was closed.  I asked Katy why she closed it, and then I corrected myself and asked if she really did close it...I always leave the bathroom door open when it's not in use.  Katy said she thought she closed it so I didn't think anything of it...until I talked to my mom the next day.  I went down to my parents' house for dinner Saturday night, and my mom and I talked about the ghost.  Mom told me that Katy told her that the bathroom door was already closed when she went to go in, so she closed it after she was done too because she thought that I must always keep it shut.  I'm 100% <i>positive</i> that it wasn't shut, like I said, I <b>never</b> keep that door closed!!!  No one else had been in the apartment that night, and nothing could have blown it shut.  How strange!  Katy said she didn't tell me because she didn't want me to freak out!<br /><br />Another weird thing I found out...remember how I said that Sammie, one of my parents dogs, acted strange while the tablecloth was in my mom's possession?  Oscar, their other dog, didn't act any differently.  We were talking about the pets' birthdays, and my dad told us that Sammie's birthday is May 23....that's also my great grandma's birthday!  Kind of odd, isn't it?!?!<br /><br />A coworker, Ann, gave me some GREAT ghost advice/info on Friday.  She's really into ghost stuff, she even taught some classes through OSU on the subject!  So now I have a list of things to try:<br /><ul><br /><li>Find out if my mom noticed strange things BEFORE she washed the tablecloths.  Ann said that usually these things start happening after a change in "state."  For example, sometimes a house doesn't have ghosts until it is renovated... <br /><i>Update:  Mom started seeing shadows and Sammie started acting freaked the day she laundered the lace.

Guess what...I don't have jury duty in December!  Ben, my manager, told me that I might try calling to see if I could get my 2 weeks of jury duty pushed back since work is going to be <b>extremely</b> busy in December.  I decided it was worth a try...and it worked!  The lady I talked to was really friendly, I didn't have to beg or anything!  Now I don't have to serve as a juror until February.  Maybe then I'll be able to enjoy it since I shouldn't have <i>too</i> much testing to do then.<br /><br />Chrissie thinks I'm a sycophant at work.  For those of you who don't subscribe to the dictionary.com Word-a-Day mailing list (I am among those of you who <b>don't</b> get the word of the day!), a sycophant is a more impressive sounding word for suckup.  Why does she say this...I'll have more details in a few days.  I myself don't have all the details, but when I do I promise I'll expand upon this topic and let all of you decide whether or not I truly am a sycophant :)<br /><br /><a href="http://houseofslug.blogspot.com">Luis</a> left a comment to my last post that said "you should do domething along the lines of a seance or whatever".  Funny you mention that Luis...I am going to have a medium/psychic over at the beginning of December.  Last year I had my first "psychic party".  A psychic party is a lot like basket, tupperware, etc parties, but the thing being sold at this party is readings with a psychic.  My mom and a few friends at work told me about Gayle (the medium), they were all really impressed with her.  So last year I decided to have her over for a psychic party.  Everyone had a good time, and all of last year's attendees had been bugging me about having another one this year.  All of this ghost stuff has been enough to convince me to have another one.  Gayle does seem to be really in touch with the spirit realm, so I'm hoping she can help me find out who the ghost(s) is.  Also, I'd like to thank <a href="http://sdominick.blogspot.com">Sharon</a> for all of her ghost advice, I really appreciate it!! :) <br /><br />Anyway, I really should do my laundry now, even though blogging is much more fun!<br><br>

First, I'll give you the latest ghost/spirit update.  Last night I was laying in bed listening to a CD with my headphones on, trying to fall asleep.  Then I felt something...it felt like something sat down at the end of the bed, down by my feet.  It wasn't like I felt something brush up against my feet, I actually felt the mattress sink like it would if someone had sat down.  Weird.  I didn't have a headache or anything, so I'm sure I didn't imagine it.  Also, after baking cookies last night I needed to wash the dishes.  I don't like using the dishwasher, so I do my dishes the old-fashioned way.  I filled up the sink, but since I just used hot water it burnt my hands.  I decided to sit down for a minute or so to let the water cool down a little.  I lost track of time, and that's when I heard the dripping sound.  I tend to be a bit (OK, more than a bit!) obsessive compulsive about turning the faucets off, the stove off, locking the doors, etc so I was 100% positive that I turned that faucet off.  When I got right in front of the sink the faucet stopped dripping, and the knob was already twisted off!  But I saw it dripping water!  And it wasn't like an occasional drip (I know that sometimes faucets will do that), it was a steady drip with less than a second between the drops.  So either my place is haunted or I'm having a breakdown :)  <br /><br />I made <a href="chocwhitechip.html">Chocolate White Chip cookies</a> for the potluck today.  After I finished baking them I didn't feel like baking anything else.  Cookies are easy to make, but I hate the cleanup!  <br><br>

My mom has been trying to come up with suggestions on ways I could get out of jury duty:<br /><ol><br /><li>Tell them you are a street person and a friend just lets you use their address...and by the way, does it matter that you smell bad or do they provide bathing facilities as well??????<br /><li>Try telling them that I will cry if you cannot go to the auction with me because I am an old, fat, tired, bawlbaby.......it could work........................<br /><li>"I have gas".....that's it, ask them if it matters that you have gas that you cannot control but you really want to serve on the jury.  Tell them it only smells for a few minutes and you will try to keep them at least 5 minutes apart but you cannot guarantee that sort of control.<br /><li>You could take Sammie with you.....and talk to him....and say Son of Sam is telling you to do things that you don't want to do.....ask if they can they help you????<br /></ol><br />I can't wait to hear what other excuses she thinks of!<br /><br />I was afraid today would be another long day here at work, but so far it's been going OK.  Tonight I need to bake cookies for the division potluck we're having tomorrow.  I think I'm going to make <a href="oatcinnchips.html">Oatmeal Cinnamon Chip</a> cookies, or maybe <a href="chocwhitechip.html">Chocolate White Chip</a> cookies...or maybe both!  <br /><br />I'm also planning to take some pictures around my house tonight, just to see if anything strange shows up in them.  Sharon gave me this link about taking ghost photos: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lighosts/10phototips.htm ">10 Tips to Better Ghost Photos </a>.  It had some good info!   I can't decide if I want anything to show up in the pictures or not...it'd be exciting, but at the same time it'd be kind of scary! <br><br>

One of the areas here at work is having a media sale to support the Mid-Ohio Foodbank, and they keep asking for donations.  My friend Mike sent an e-mail last night that said "Beth,  I am NOT giving up my Duran Duran's greatest hits CD!  I don't care what kind of moral pressure they put on me!!!!!! ".  I always give Mike a hard time about his music...he really does own and listen to Duran Duran's greatest hits!  So I sent him an e-mail this morning suggesting that instead of Duran Duran he could donate his Toto's Greatest hits CD.  His reply made me laugh:  <br /><blockquote>"I could never give up my Toto's greatest hits CD.  Hunger goes away after the first meal, but songs like "Africa" last FOREVER!"</blockquote><br />Too funny!<br><br>

Last night, after I turned off the computer, I remembered something else that I wanted to mention in my blog:<br /><br />I'm assigned as a lead on a piece of a big project that we start testing in December.  I had a bunch (I think 5 days) of Quality Practitioner classes scheduled, but I decided I shouldn't attend them since I'll be extremely busy with testing.  Well, last night I saw a letter in my mailbox (my <i>real</i> mailbox, not my e-mail inbox) that made my heart stop...I've been summoned for jury duty.  It really was the first thing I saw in my mailbox, it said "OFFICIAL JURY SUMMONS" in big, bold, black letters.  I was hoping it'd be for January, but I wasn't that lucky...I have jury duty for 2 weeks right in the middle of December.  I always thought jury duty would be interesting, but I'm not excited about it at all right now.  It's just <b>terrible</b> timing.  I'll get behind on my testing, and I also had to cancel some vacation time that I had scheduled to go to a big auction.  Oh well, I guess I shouldn't complain.  Afterall, like the letter also says in nice bold type:<br /><br /><center><b><u>THINK ABOUT IT</u></b><br /><ul><br /><li>Its more than <b>Civic Responsibility....EVERY RIGHT REQUIRES SUPPORT</b><br /><li>Its protection of a <b>Constitutional Right....IT TAKES EVERYONE'S EFFORT</b><br /><li>Its <b>Educational anf Informative....YOU MAY OBSERVE IN COURTROOMS</b><br /></ul></center><br />The timing still sucks for me though!  Of course there's not a thing I can do about it.  And "failure to appear without lawful excusal will subject you to penalty provided by Ohio law".  I shouldn't complain anyway, maybe I'll have fun.  Also, like Chrissie pointed out last night, only a true workaholic (or sycophant) would complain about a chance to get out of work for a few weeks! :)<br /><br />We had another team lunch today, we went to Anna's.  It's an authenic Greek restaurant on Sawmill Road.  I had never really eaten Greek food before, but it was good.  We all had gyros, and I think we all ordered them without onions! :)  <br /><br />Nothing new with the ghost tonight.  The candle holders on the bookcase with the lace were moved up towards the edge again.  <br /><br />I think I may have a new little brother soon.  Well, at least that's what my dad would say...I think my parent's are going to get a new wiener dog.  After the auction this past Saturday, my parents and I stopped to visit the "Wiener Dog Lady".  She's the breeder they got Oscar and Sammie from.  Mom really wants a black and tan long haired dachshund.  She had one that was adorable, but she also has a 10 month old brindle colored male that needs a home.  She can't keep him for breeding since he's bowlegged.  He is a beautiful dog, and they can get him 1/2 price.  Oscar and Sammie were also 1/2 price due to problems that would make them unfit breeding dogs.  My parents seem to like "defective" dogs!!! <br><br>

As if my normal battles with insomnia weren't bad enough, my efforts to sleep will be much more complicated tonight due to the spirit's presence.  Not too much has happened since I've been home from work, but here's the most recent events:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li>The first thing I did when I got home tonight was check out the bookcase that I draped one of the lace tablecloth things on.  I have 2 copper taper candle holders on the front corners of the bookcase.  They have been in the same place for the last two years, they never move from where I put them.  Tonight the left candle holder was moved, and about a quarter of an inch of it was hanging off the edge.  I moved it back, and a few minutes later it was back near the edge again.  So far it's stayed where I put it.<br /><li>Next thing that happened involved a window.  First, you need to know that I rarely turn my thermostat up or down...I set it and leave it.  I called my mom and told her about the candle holder.  After I finished talking to her I ran upstairs to change out of my work clothes.  It only took me probably 2-3 minutes to change.  I went back downstairs to start cooking dinner.  When I got downstairs I noticed that my window had fogged up.  It was all foggy except for one strip right down the center, vertical from the top to the bottom.  I thought it might be due to a temperature change, but since I didn't adjust the thermostat and since the sun wasn't hitting that window I determined that wasn't it.  Also, that strip down the middle didn't make sense either.<br /><li>Last but not least...this is the second time I've tried posting about this.  The first time my computer just turned off while typing the third sentence.  My computer has turned off on it's own before, but usually when that happens on the laptop the power indicator for the battery is shut off.  Not so tonight, the battery light didn't even flicker.<br /></ol><br />I've been trying to think about other things.  I'm usually not a paranoid person, but tonight I've been just awful.  I keep seeing shadows, and I'm sure it's not the spirit, just my imagination.  I took two Alluna Sleep pills, they're the best non-addictive sleeping aid ever!  Hopefully that'll help me get some rest!<br /><br />I talked with Chrissie tonight, her ankle is a little better I guess.  It still sounds terrible to me!  Ankle injuries are bad, I broke my left one back in high school.  It was pretty embarassing.  I went to a Catholic high school.  The public schools bused us there.  The high school kids got out first, then we drove to the elementary/junior high school and had to wait about half an hour or 45 minutes (I can't remember, it was about 7 years ago that I rode the bus!) until they got out.  Instead of sitting on the buses, we'd all walk around the first floor and outside of the school.  One autumn day, I think it was a Wednesday or Thursday, a bunch of us were walking down the stairs in front of the school on our way back to the buses.  I was talking and not paying much attention.  I was on the last step...one more step and I'd be on the nice, flat, level sidewalk.  And that's when it happened...I tripped on my own big feet and fell right in front of my friends!  I was absolutely mortified, but I decided to laugh about it.  Then I tried to get up.  I felt a terrible pain shoot up my leg.  That's when I noticed that my foot was bent in towards my body.  That's just about the time panic struck.  A few friends ran in the school and came back out with the school secretary.  She saw my ankle and ran back in (as fast as a 70 year old could run) to get the school nurse.  While I was waiting for what seemed like an eternity for the nurse, a group of second graders and their teacher ran over to see if I was OK.  Being surrounded by a bunch of kids asking questions while waiting for the nurse was quite embarassing for a sophomore in high school.  The nurse finally came and took me inside.  She took off my shoe to look at the ankle, and then gave me an ice pack.  Then it was time for me to put my shoe back on and get back on the bus.  However, when she tried to get my shoe back on it wouldn't fit...my ankle was that swollen!  So I had to leave it off.  No big deal...until I got home and had to get off the bus with my shoe, the backpack, and my tenor sax!  What a mess!  And as if that wasn't bad enough, I had to get my mom to write me a note to get me out of gym class.  She wrote the note and sealed it.  I trusted her and thought nothing of it.  I gave it to the gym teacher/football coach the next day and he cracked up laughing...turns out my mom decided to be humorous.  The letter said:<br /><br />"Dear Mr. <i>XXXXX</i>, <br /><br />Please excuse Beth from gym class today.  She was struck down on the steps of St. Mary's yesterday in punishment for her many sins.  Her ankle is quite swollen, and the only activity she can participate in is the one legged limp relay.<br /><br />Thank you"<br /><br />I couldn't believe it.  It seemed like <i>everyone</i> heard about that note, even though only about 5% of our tiny school probably did hear about it!  That was just one of those traumatic moments I'll never forget!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm starting to feel a little tired, and I hear my bed calling my name.  I think I'll go and get some sleep (hopefully)!!<br><br>

I've always believed in life after death and spirts (ghosts).  This sort of stuff fascinates me.  However, I never experienced any hauntings firsthand.  Until recently anyway!<br /><br />This morning my alarm went off and I got up and turned it off.  Then I laid back in bed for a little while.  I didn't fall asleep, I was just laying there thinking.  Sometimes I start thinking too much and I lose track of time.  So I was laying there when all of a sudden I heard two knocks <i>on my bedroom door</i>!!!!  No one other than me was home, so it totally freaked me out.  I wasn't sure what to do...should I stay in bed and call the police or should I look around?  I decided to check the house out, which was a stupid thing to do if someone had broken in.  I am <b>positive</b> that the noise did not come from next door.  I hear things next door, and they are a little muffled, this was definitely a knock on my bedroom door!  The first thing I did was check outside, but there were no people or animals that could have made the knocking sound.  I also checked to make sure all the doors and windows were locked.  Everything seemed fine.  I opened all the doors, the shower curtain, cupboards...everything!  There was nothing in my house.  <br /><br />When I got to work I called my mom to tell her my story.  She said it was weird, and then she said "I bet it's your great grandmother, you took the lace home this weekend".  Last Saturday (11/9) a bunch of us were looking through stuff at my great uncle's house.  I found two old lace tablecloths (they're about the size of tablecloths anyway, but the ornate lacework is only on one edge so I'm not sure exactly what they were used for) and two small handmade pillows.  They more than likely belonged to my great grandma.  Mom washed them for me and kept them until I took them home this Saturday.  Mom told me that a bunch of things happened while the lace was in her house.  She kept seeing shadows, and Sammie (one of the dogs) and Splotches (the cat) acted strange.  Sam just acted nervous and spooked, and the cat kept staring at unseen things.  Like I said, I took the lace and pillows home with me on Saturday.  Mom said she didn't see any shadows yesterday.  Also, Sammie and Splotch were acting normal again (well, as normal as they can anyway!).  However, now "things" are happening at my house!!!  In addition to the "knocking", I also kept seeing things moving out of the corner of my eye yesterday, but when I'd turn to look nothing was there.  I blamed it sun hitting the windows and throwing shadows, but since there was no sun yesterday (it was a normal overcast Ohio day!) that probably wasn't it.  I am totally freaked out!  I love reading about ghost stories, watching these stories on TV, or even visiting haunted places, but it's really different when you're the one actually witnessing this sort of stuff!  At least this is a nice spirit.  I won't have to worry about oversleeping ever again!  <br /><br />I wasn't overly impressed with <i>The Magic Flute</i>.  There were some humorous scenes, but I thought the plot was pretty lame.  I'm glad I saw it, but it ranks on the bottom of my favorite operas list.  Poor Chrissie...before she came over to meet me for the opera she fell in a puddle in the Battelle parking lot!  Her pants were soaked from the knees down, and her left ankle was extremely swollen.   Of course, I gave her a hard time about it, but I really did feel bad for her!<br /><br />The auction on Saturday was fun.  I did get a few things, all for really cheap prices too!   All glassware of course!<br /><br />I think I'm going to a pagan book club meeting this Thursday.  Fly-by-Night, a local pagan bookstore, is having it.  It sounds like it'll be a good time!<br><br>

Even though I was in training classes and technically working, it still felt weird going into work this afternoon.  It also seemed like I hadn't been in the office for weeks! <br /><br />Tomorrow Chrissie and I are going to the opera, Opera Columbus is performing <i>The Magic Flute</i>.  I don't think I've seen a Mozart opera yet.  No, I just went through the list of operas I've seen and I haven't see any of his.  Should be fun!  I'll have to think about what I'll wear.  Maybe I'll wear the same thing I did last time, or better yet, maybe I'll wear "the dress"...you know, the one I wrote about the last time I was trying to decide what to wear to the opera and Justin's wedding!   No, I won't wear it since I'm sure Chrissie would give me a hard time about that being the only dress I ever wear, better to find a different outfit.<br /><br />It's almost time for me to think about dressing the frogs up for the Christmas card pictures.  Yes, I have decided to make my own cards again this year. I think my mom may even have me print out some personalized wiener dog cards for her to send out.  That means we'll have to dress up "the boys" (as my dad calls them, it's not nice to call them dogs!) for some 2002 Christmas pictures.  <br /><br />When I decided to bring my passion vine inside a few weeks ago I had to cut it way back since it was just too big.  I was a little worried that I may have cut it back too far because the first few days it was inside a bunch of leaves fell off.  But now it seems to be doing great!  There are a few new vines growing, and one is already about 14 inches long.  I think it may just survive!  <br /><br />Anyway, now I think I'll go read some more of the new glass collecting books I bought the other night.  I know of one person who doesn't like his books, but I think <a href="http://www.geneflorence.com">Gene Florence's glass collecting books</a> are the best!<br><br>

So I lied in my last post...I didn't get around to updating my blog last night either.  Work has been keeping me busy!  I had 3 all day training classes this week, which meant I had to log into work from home to read my work e-mail and stuff.  After working overtime, logging on to play on the internet didn't sound too fun.  Plus I was busy reading some new glass collecting books.  I acquired some new glassware and I was pretty busy trying to identify the patterns and such.  I am a glassaholic, I just love collecting and reading about it!  Some people think that's a "geeky" hobby for someone my age.  If only I could explain to them just how interesting and exciting it really is!!<br /><br />World Market finally got White Tea in!  It's a really light tea, and it tastes different than any other tea I've had.  It's really good though.  They say White Tea has the highest antioxidant level of any kind of tea, even more than green or red tea.  <br /><br />Well, I need to get back to work now, but I'll <i>try</i> to write again this evening.<br><br>

Today wasn't any more exciting than yesterday was, but at least it's Thursday...only one more work day until the weekend!!<br /><br />Today my mom stopped by my desk at work, and she brought me a page from last Sunday's local newspaper...the page with the engagement announcements.  A friend from high school that I had a big falling out with (let's just say she was a filthy roommate that liked to grow mold on wet bath towels...a long story that I'm not going into right now!) is engaged now to this mean guy she met on the internet.  They've been together for a few years, but I never thought she'd marry him.  Anyway, none of us (my friends and I) have heard from or about her since our falling out, so it was interesting to read about what's she's been up to and to see a picture of her and the dweeb...oops, I mean her fiance!  <br /><br />I was listening to Nine Inch Nails (the <i>Downward Spiral</i> CD) today, which made me think of another misheard lyric that I read on my calendar that made me laugh.  The misheard lyric came from the song "Closer":<br /><br />Right lyric: "You can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings, you can have my absence of faith"<br />Wrong lyric: "You can have my insulation, you can have the heat that it brings, you can have my abestos flakes"<br /><br />That's one of my favorites.  I think my second favorite misheard lyric has been from "Joy to the World" by Three Dog Night:<br /><br />Right lyric: "Joy to the world, all the boys and girls"<br />Wrong lyric: "Joy to the world, all the poisoned squirrels"<br /><br />And today's misheard lyric was from "Waterfalls" by TLC:<br /><br />Right lyric:  "Don't go chasin' waterfalls"<br />Wrong lyric:  "Go, go Jason Waterfalls"<br /><br />Anyway, that's about it for tonight!<br><br>

This week hasn't gone as fast as the last few weeks.  It's strange, because I've been super busy.  I was convinced that it was Thursday when I woke up this morning!  Today was an <b>extremely</b> busy day.  I had a two hour meeting (which wasn't so great...which didn't surprise me since it's a committee meeting that I have each week that never goes well), and we also had a team lunch.  Well, it really wasn't a team lunch, more like a division lunch.  Sheri, Deidee, and myself all decided last week that we'd go to lunch at Sumeno's today.  We decided to invite everyone else in our division, and we had about 13 people go.  It was fun!  <br /><br />Tonight I went to pick up some lotion my mom ordered from <a href="http://www.greengirlbasics.com">Green Girl Basics</a>.  Mom and I took a lotion making class that Colleen, the person behind <a href="http://www.greengirlbasics.com">Green Girl Basics</a>, taught.  Mom really liked her lotion and ordered some.  I tried out the patchouli lotion mom ordered and I love it!  She also got some Lavendar/Clary Sage lotion that smells awesome too.  I use Colleen's soaps (which you can purchase online) and highly recommend them.  I had fun talking with her, and I had fun petting her dog :)  Frogs are good pets, but furry pets are nice too.  Well, with the exception of my parent's <a href="wienerdogs.html">wiener dogs</a> that is, they're not so nice...they're stubborn little dogs!  I'm sure that statement will generate a few comments from my mom about what nice little dogs they are!  OK, I guess they're really not all that bad...but even she has to admit that they're stubborn!  <br /><br />Anyway, I can't think of anything else to write about.  Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting.<br><br>

I must be getting old.  Why do I say that?  Well, it's something that I've heard myself say the past few weeks.  It happened again tonight...I was driving home from work, listening to the radio like I do every time I drive someplace.  The radio station played the song "Rocket" (Smashing Pumpkins, <i>Siamese Dream</i>), and I thought to myself "Wow, this song reminds me of high school".  Next thing you know I'll be saying "Why back when I was a kid we had to walk a mile to school..." :)  Just kidding, but it does make me feel old when I catch myself saying stuff like that about songs I hear on the radio!  I try not to mention feeling old around my coworkers, it seems to almost offend some of them.  When I say I'm getting old they always ask what that must make them (I'm quite a bit younger than most of them).   I'm really not trying to make them feel old.  <br /><br />When they moved my area up to the Dublin offices, one of the things they kept stressing to make us more accepting of the move was the free parking.  Sure, it's nice, but sometimes I miss parking downtown in the garage.  Like today...when I left work it was raining pretty hard.  Since it wasn't raining this morning I didn't even think about taking my umbrella.  As a result I had to walk to my vehicle in the rain...I was soaking wet and cold by the time I made it to the car!  And since I live in Ohio, the state of unpredictable weather, this could happen quite often.  So yeah, free parking isn't as wonderful as they made it out to be.  <br /><br><br>

I watched the remake of Stephen King's <i>Carrie</i> on NBC last night.  It wasn't terrible, but I was disappointed.  I liked the original version MUCH better.  I really didn't like the new ending.  If I was able to do it over, I would have done "web stuff" instead of watching it.  It felt kind of weird watching TV all evening.  I rarely watch TV...I try to watch the news each night and that's about it.  <br /><br />I still need to vote today.  I am so happy that election day is finally here, I don't think I could take many more political advertisements on my voicemail!!  This year seems worse than usual, I had between 3-6 political ads on my voicemail each day!  There is one politician that I wouldn't have voted for anyway, but I definitely won't vote for him since I had a message from his campaign on my voicemail each day for the past 2 weeks!  Not to mention at least 3 ads from him in my mailbox each week too!  <br /><br />I left the cap off of my pen and managed to get ink all over my hand.  It's green ink, and it kinda makes it look like my hand is molding!!<br /><br />This morning I went to an awards breakfast for our "I got caught" program.  It was a very nice breakfast, even though I'm really not a breakfast person.  Quite a few people from my area attended too, it was fun.<br /><br />I tried out a new chicken enchilada recipe last night.  It's an awesome recipe, I'll add it to <a href="bethrecipes.html">my recipes</a> page on the site soon, but until I do you can find it here:<br /><br /><u>Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas</u><br /><ul><br /><li>1 can Campbell's&reg; Cheddar Cheese Soup<br /><li>1/2 cup milk<br /><li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken<br /><li>3/4 cup Pace&reg; Picante Sauce<br /><li>1 tsp. chili powder<br /><li>8 flour tortillas (8 inch)<br /></ul><br /><br />Directions:<br />MIX soup and milk.<br />MIX 2 tablespoons soup mixture, chicken, picante sauce and chili powder.<br />Spread 1/2 cup soup mixture in 3-quart shallow baking dish. <br />Spoon about 1/4 cup chicken mixture on each tortilla. <br />Roll tortilla around filling and place seam-side down in baking dish. <br />Top with remaining soup mixture. Cover.<br />Bake at 350F for 25 minutes or until hot. <br /><br />I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the chicken mixture and sprinkled some on top.  I also used <a href="http://extremefood.com/category.php?id=ds_dryrubs">Blair's Death Rain Chipotle and Habanero Dry Spices</a> instead of the chili powder.  Other than those minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly.<br /><br />I also wanted to mention that I finally added the cemetery and Clay Haus pictures to the navigation bar that's on my <a href="index.html">Homepage</a>.  I added a new page with pictures (only 2) from Lockville Park.  <a href="lockville.html">Click here</a> to view my page, and <a href="http://www.historicalparks.org/Lockville.htm">click here</a> to view the Lockville page on the <a href="http://www.historicalparks.org">Fairfield County Historical Parks</a> website.  The cemetery, Clay Haus, and Lockville pages are all under the "Adventures" heading in my site's navigation bar.<br><br>

Today hasn't been too bad for a Monday.  It has been very busy, but not stressful busy.  <br /><br />Last night Chrissie had a few of us over for dinner at her place, and it was really fun.  Chrissie made chili for dinner...chili with corn in it.  I'm not a big corn fan, but her chili was <b>very</b> good!  And I had hot sauce in my purse (I always have hot sauce with me!) so that made the chili perfect!  I made my "famous" brownies, and as usual everyone thought they were the best brownies ever.  In my last post I said they were Duncan Hines, but I was wrong.  They are Betty Crocker regular, family size brownies in the red box.  Sarah made chocolate chip cookies that were very good too.  I took a few home and packed them in today's lunch.  And Kyle made cheesecake...it was a great dessert night!<br /><br />We played a game called "Dirty Minds".  You get three clues that describe "dirty words/deeds", but you're supposed to guess the clean answer.  At first I thought it was really difficult, but once I got in the right frame of mind (thinking clean) it was pretty easy.  I actually won the first round, which surprised me!  Next time I go shopping I'll have to see if I can find it.  Writing "dirty deeds" made me think of a misheard AC/DC lyric that was on my calendar a few months ago. The correct lyric is "dirty deeds done dirt cheap", and the misheard lyric was "dirty deeds done to sheep"!  Now every time I hear that song I think of sheep!!  That calendar has messed up a lot of songs for me, but so has my sister.  My two favorite lyrics that my sister misheard have been:<br /><br />1.  Marilyn Manson - Disposable Teens:<br />right lyric="disposable teens"<br />sister's lyric="disposable teeth"<br /><br />2.  System of a Down - Aerials<br />right lyric="aerials, in the sky"<br />sister's lyric="aliens, in the sky"<br /><br />Anyway, tonight I need to finish cleaning house.  I didn't get around to doing that this weekend so now I have to do it during the week.  My lunch break is almost over, time to get back to work!<br><br>

Tonight I had to get my biweekly supply of crickets for the frogs, and I decided to get a treat for the African Clawed Frogs...feeder fish!  I put 12 in the aquarium, and now there are only 4 swimming around.  I thought they'd last at least 3 days, but I bet the last 4 fish will be gone by the end of the night.  <br /><br />I saw the coolest Betta ever at Petsmart tonight.  It was completely white, but the girl who was counting out my crickets said it wasn't albino, just white.  She has it on hold.  She already has 8 Bettas and keeps getting more when they get colors in that she doesn't already have.  There was a blue one that had  a white border on it's bottom fin, and I almost bought it.  But the thought of cleaning another aquarium was enough to change my mind.  Besides, I don't have good luck with Bettas.  Lucifish, the red Betta I had while living in Michigan, was the only one that really did well.  He lived for a little over 2 years.  Luci was the coolest fish ever.  Maybe I've written about this before, but I'll tell the story again.  Lucifish liked Metallica.  One day my roommates (Jen and Amy) and I were listening to Metallica's "One".  When it came to that harder part in the middle, the part that goes "Darkness imprisoning me...", we all noticed that Luci was swimming along to the beat of the music.  At first we thought it had to be the bass shaking the aquarium, but we turned the bass and the volume down really low and he still swam to the music.  It was the coolest thing ever, a fish that liked Metallica!  "One" was the only song he ever did that too, and he did it multiple times so it wasn't just a fluke.  And since it's a question I usually get after telling this story...no, we weren't drinking or doing drugs so it wasn't a hallucination!<br /><br />Sunday Chrissie is cooking dinner for a bunch of us at her place.  She asked if I could bring my "famous brownies".  Everyone says I make the best brownies.  But it's not difficult...Duncan Hines family size brownie mix (the ones in the red box), baked in a 9x13 pan.  So I kinda feel almost guilty when people go on and on about how good they are!  Anyone can bake perfect brownies, the secret is to not overbake them.<br /><br />I'm thinking about dressing the frogs up for Thanksgiving.  The costumes I have in mind may be too complex for them, they don't even like wearing hats, let alone turkey feathers!  I think I'll give it a try though.  <br /><br />I haven't put away the Halloween decorations yet.  Guess I should do that now.  Of course, I may as well wait until tomorrow since it's already after 11. Maybe I'll just put away a few and finish up tomorrow.  That sounds like a good plan!<br><br>

Last night I bought a new CD with an advisory label (Murderdolls), which isn't any different than other times I buy CDs since most of them do have advisory labels on them.  But last night was different because I got carded!!  I think it's wierd that I have to show my ID for a CD since I almost never get carded when I buy alcohol.   I called my mom when I got home to tell her that I was carded, and she asked me what CD I bought.  I heard my dad in the background say "Oh, she probably bought Satan's Greatest Hits"!  That cracked me up, the music I listen to isn't <i>that</i> bad!!!<br /><br />Today I went to an awesome Thai/Chinese restaurant for lunch, the Thai Orchid on Sawmill Road.  I went with Thiru and Sheri.  We couldn't decide where to go, so we decided to go to Applebee's.  Then we started talking about other places in the area we had gone to for lunch, and that's when Thiru mentioned the Thai Orchid.  I'm so glad he thought of it, the food was <b>really</b> good.  <br /><br />I've started reading Clive Barker's newest book, <i>Abarat</i>.  I guess saying that I've started to read it isn't quite true.  I did start to read it last night, but I'm about 140 pages into it now...I'm a fast reader!  So far I really like it.  That doesn't surprise me though, I have yet to read a Clive Barker book that I don't like!<br /><br />Tonight I need to finish taking down my Halloween decorations and put them away.  I really don't have any Thanksgiving decorations so I don't have to worry about decorating for that.  Ugh, but pretty soon it'll be time to decorate for Christmas.  I have a lot of cute Christmas decorations, but putting up the tree is a major pain.  Last year I put it up the day after Thanksgiving, and only about a week later it fell over.  I wasn't able to just pick it up and have it look the same as before it fell, most of the ornaments had fallen off and the branches were all mangled and bent.  I couldn't bear the thought of decorating it again, so I put it away!  My family gave me a hard time about being a "Scrooge, Bah Humbug!" for doing that.  I guess I should buy a new artificial tree for this year.  One that's more stable and won't fall over!!<br><br>
