On February 8, 2010 I received an e-mail from Chad about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

I am writing this experience fresh, as I have not seen anything like it in your stories board, and feel that it deserves sharing. Myself and two friends sat down this evening to try having a Ouija session. We have used the board once before, with mixed success. Having a bit more confidence, we began the session with just two of us, and immediately made contact. An entity describing itself as &quot;Sophia&quot; or &quot;Soph,&quot; immediately identified itself, it's age as 43, and then urgently began going directly to the bottom left hand side of the board. We were using a Hasbro board, and this corner shows a medium and two hands engaged in playing Ouija.
<br><br>
Our third friend joined us, and over the course of about seven attempts, we consistently raised Soph. The general message, we quickly worked out, was that &quot;Ouija is a no no.&quot; It repeatedly returned to the name of the board at the top, and then to A N O, A N O. We finally asked outright if that was the message, and the board responded yes. We then proceeded to ask why Ouija was a no no.
<br><br>
Prior to beginning our sesion, we agreed to establish rules for the board. Those rules being that any good spirits would be allowed to enter the sun symbol on the board, but not the moon. Further, that any bad spirits would be permitted to enter the moon, but not the sun. After repeatedly asking Soph to enter the sun, and then the moon, we established that she was most definitely a positive spirit.
<br><br>
When asked why the Ouija was a no no, the planchette immediately entered the moon. All I can assume is that the nature of the question allowed a loophole in the rules.
<br><br>
We felt that this was an important experience to share, as none of us had previously heard of a spirit on a Ouija board explicitly say that Ouija was &quot;A no no because of bad spirits.&quot; After some discussion, and multiple precautions such as a bowl of water, white candles, burning sage, and silver on the board, we elected to stop playing.
<br><br>
We intend to try again in seven days, out of the possibility that perhaps there were mitigating forces, such as the wrong time of the week or month, or the near presence of a bad spirit.
<br><br>
That's all, folks, just thought you might find this one unique.
<br><br>
One final note; I felt distinctly that we had made definite contact with something intelligent, and something positive. The experience felt noticeably more powerful and clearly &quot;not us&quot; than our previous session. Safe playing, all.
