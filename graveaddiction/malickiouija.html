On November 20, 2004 I received an e-mail from Malicki about a scary experience he and his friends had after using an ouija board:
<br><br><br>
&quot;Rest assured that this isn't much of a story. Nor do I remember the date that it actually took place, but I can tell you it's been a couple years ago.
<br><br>
Me and 2 other friends decided to take the board out to another friend's house. It seemed pretty much pointless at the time due to no one really being serious about it. For the most part, although I believe in using a board, in a small town, you mainly get people that move it themselves to get a thrill out of watching other people new to it freak out. So you're never really sure if its actually working, or if someone else is doing it. However, about 30 minutes of two of them messing around, we packed the board back up and drove home. However, they didn't clear the board or session.
<br><br>
On the way home...I was driving, and throughout checking my mirrors, I kept seeing a 4th person sitting behind me. I quickly turned around in my seat only to find the board sitting behind me. A few minutes later.. I saw the passenger quickly turn around, and turn back around even faster, and do nothing besides stare out the window... again...out of the corner of my eye in the mirror I thought I saw someone's head sitting behind me, almost as if someone was sitting on top of the board. There was complete silence in the car for about the next 10 minutes. Until the guy who was sitting in the back seat asked what was going on. I simply replied to his question with one of my own - 'did you clear the board before left?' He was like, 'no, why?' After a brief pause I said, 'because you're sitting back there with someone&quot;
