On March 6, 2010 I received an e-mail from Hayley about an interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>

Spirit writing is pretty much the same thing as a Ouija board, only with paper and pencil. You have to hold a pencil in this weird way and let the spirit guide it across the paper.
<br><br>
I was with my 11 year old sister, Molly, and her best friend, Hope. We weren't getting any good results on the Ouija board that day, so we decided to do this instead.
<br><br>
You can only do it with one person, so this is basically how Hope's conversation went.
<br><br>
Hope: (draws three circles) Are there any spirits here?<br>
Paper: (Starts drawing random squiggles)<br>
<br>
Hope: Draw a heart if that's a yes.<br>
Paper: (draws a heart)<br>
<br>
Hope: What's your name?<br>
Paper: Tiffiny<br>
<br>
Hope: How old are you?<br>
Paper: 23<br>
<br>
Hope: How did you die?<br>
Paper: Car<br>
<br>
Hope: Did you die in a car accident?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Hope: What year did you die?<br>
Paper: 2010<br>
<br>
Hope: Did you die in February?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Hope: What day?<br>
Paper: 19<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you have anything to tell us?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Hope: Go ahead.<br>
Paper: I know you guys<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you know our names?<br>
Paper: yes<br>
<br>
Hope: What's my name?<br>
Paper: Hope<br>
<br>
Hope: What's the girl's name in the red sweater? (that was me)<br>
Paper: Hayley (That is my name. I then started laughing hysterically.)<br>
<br>
Hope: What's the girl's name in the gray sweater? (that was Molly)<br>
Paper: Molly<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you follow us around?<br>
Paper: yes<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you know the names of our schools?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Hope: What's the name of mine and Molly's school?<br>
Paper: **** ******* (she wrote the name of Molly's and Hope's elementary school)<br>
<br>
Hope: What's the name of Hayley's school?<br>
Paper: ******* (she wrote the name of my middle school)<br>
<br>
Hope: What's my mom's boyfriend's name?<br>
Paper: Brian (her mom's boyfriend's name was indeed Brian)<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you have anything else to tell us?<br>
Paper: I don't blame you for hating your mom, Hope. (Hope does hate her mom)<br>
<br>
Hope: Why?<br>
Paper: Doesn't pay any attention to you.<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you know any of our friends?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Hope: Do you know any of Hayley's friends?<br>
Paper: Brittany (I do have a friend named Brittany)<br>
<br>
Hope: What's a name of one of our friends?<br>
Paper: Hannah. (they do have a friend named Hannah)<br>
<br>
Hope: I have to go do my homework now. Bye.<br>
Paper: Bye<br>
<br>
Sorry this is long, but right after that, I had a conversation with the same girl.  Here goes...<br>
<br>
Me: Are there any spirits here?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you Tiffiny?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want to talk to me?<br>
Paper: No<br>
<br>
Me: Why not?<br>
Paper: You hate me<br>
<br>
Me: No, I don't. I was just surprised that you knew me.<br>
Paper: Oh<br>
<br>
Me: Do you want to talk to me now?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Do you really know me?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How?<br>
Paper: IDK<br>
<br>
Me: What class do I have second period?<br>
Paper: Math (she was right)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know any of my other friends?<br>
Paper: Lexzie (I also have a friend named Lexzie)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you sitting right here? (I pointed to the space next to me)<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Are you touching me?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Where?<br>
Paper: Neck (I kinda started freaking out then)<br>
<br>
Me: Are you going to hurt me?<br>
Paper: No<br>
<br>
Me: Do you like drawing?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Can you draw something please?<br>
Paper: (draws a heart)<br>
<br>
Me: Can you draw anything else?<br>
Paper: (Draws a peace sign)<br>
<br>
Me: Were you with me and Brittany when we were doing spirit writing at her house?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: Did you try to talk to me?<br>
Paper: Maybe (pencil then goes off the paper. I scream.)<br>
<br>
Me: Please don't go off the paper, ok?<br>
Paper: Ok<br>
<br>
Me: Do you have anything to tell me?<br>
Paper: You like my butt.<br>
<br>
Me: I like your butt?<br>
Paper: Yes<br>
<br>
Me: How can I like it if I can't see it?<br>
Paper: (Random squiggles)<br>
<br>
Me: Do you know my middle name?<br>
Paper: No<br>
<br>
Me: Ok, I have to go now. Bye.<br>
Paper: (writing slowly) Bye.<br>
<br>
That's the shortest story I have...I think. All my other Ouija Board stories are too long.
<br><br>
THE END
