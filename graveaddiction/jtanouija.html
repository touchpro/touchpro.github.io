On November 16, 2006 I received an e-mail from Jamie Tan about her interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Me, my husband (Keith), and our friend (Diane) had been playing with the Ouija Board for few weeks now. Nothing really stuck out, but with our latest experience it had really taken us by surprise. This happened on Nov 3rd of 2006. We were out in our patio at about 12am and pulled out the Ouija Board and started to ask if there was any entity that would like to communicate with us. Few minutes later, the cursor went to YES and we started asking questions about the entity. First it kept going MAMAMAMA. It was a 9 year old girl named Nyaj. And here it goes...
<br><br>
Diane: Are you happy where you're at?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Diane: Are you looking for someone?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Jamie: What country were you from?<br>
Board: Just a bunch of letters that doesn't make any sense to us<br>
<br>
Jamie: Were you from a middle eastern country?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  Can you see any of our relatives that had passed?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Jamie: Is it my relative?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jamie: Is it a relatives of Keith?<br>
Board: No<br>
<br>
Jamie: Is it one of Diane's relatives?<br>
Board: Yes<br>
<br>
Sometime right around here Keith had removed his fingers from the cursor.<br>
<br>
Diane: Can you tell me how many children I have?<br>
Board: 4<br>
<br>
Diane: Can you tell me how many are still with me?<br>
Board:  2<br>
<br>
Diane:  My children that passed, are they girls?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Diane:  Are they boys?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane: Can you tell me the first initial of my first son's name?<br>
Board: Went to the letter J (Diane's first son was named Joseph and there was no way Keith and I could have known)<br>
<br>
Diane: Can you tell the first initial of my second son's name?<br>
Board:  Went to NO (Diane lost her child during pregnancy and didn't name her child)<br>
<br>
Diane: Can you tell me what year my first child passed?<br>
Board: 1981<br>
<br>
At this time Diane had freaked out and burst out in tears. And she had taken her fingers away from the cursor.  I was yelling at her to place her fingers back onto the cursor and properly end the session. I kept saying goodbye but the cursor wouldn't move. After saying goodbye for about 1 minute nothing happened, then Diane placed her fingers back at the cursor and immediately I said goodbye and the cursor went to Goodbye too. But wait - there is more.  This was when Diane told us about her first child that she had lost.
<br><br>
About 10 minutes later, we were at it again for Diane had more questions to ask. Again we asked if there was any entity that wanted to communicate with us, and the board started moving around the alphabet.
<br><br>
Jamie:  Are you Nyaj?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane: I am not upset with you Nyaj (still in tears)<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  No, I am not upset with you. I am just upset about what happened long time ago. Can you tell me if my sons are angels?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  Does my mother (passed in 1992) know my babies now?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  Are they with her now?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  Is my mother happy to be with her grandchildren?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Now the cursor is moving very weakly. And slowly moved to Goodbye. We started talking about what just happened. It got me curious about what else we could ask. And a few moments later we started a new session. This time it was an 8 year old boy named Mola. Mola was able to tell us about Keith's sister who had passed, and also spelled out Keith's passed grandmother's name and also his passed father's name. I asked about my passed brother.  And sure enough everything we asked had been answered correctly. It was about 3am now and we were all getting tired. Then...
<br><br>
Keith:  Mola, would you like to play a game?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Keith:  Now guess how many fingers I have held up in my pocket.  (The board was correct 5 out of 5 times)
<br><br>
Shortly after, I said our goodbyes. And that ended our Ouija Board experience for that night. A week later we pulled out the board again. Before we started, we were acting really goofy. Keith was singing and we were just laughing our hearts out. We were calling Hola Mola. About 30 minutes later after we settled down from our laughs and put on our serious faces.  We called to any entity who would like to communicate. We were contacted by a lady that didn't want to answer any questions, and only for about a few minutes later it had moved to goodbye. But check this out though. This next 30 minutes freak me out. Keith is sitting this one out and started singing again. Diane and I started calling to the other realm.
<br><br>
Diane:  Is there anyone that would like to communicate with us<br>
Board:  MAMAMAMAMAMAMA<br>
<br>
Jamie:  Is this Nyaj?<br>
Board:  No<br>
<br>
Jamie:  Is this Mola?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
We started asking Mola questions, like if anything bad would happen to us if we kept communicating with the entities and if they would get into any trouble by communicating with us. All sign points to yes. We started to get nervous by now and then...
<br><br>
Diane:  Mola, would you like Keith to sing for you?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Diane:  What song would you like to hear?<br>
Board:  Mama<br>
<br>
So we make Keith sing us songs. There were be songs that Mola didn't like, and he would show us by going to No.  When it was a song that he did like, the cursor would go to the symbol of the smiling sun. Diane had suggested that Keith sing the Mockingbird song. He had twisted the song to where he would sing daddy instead mommy. EVERYTIME he got to the daddy part of the song, the cursor moved to NO and would go back to the smiling sun during the other part of the song. The cursor was going back and forth between the Sun and No without any stops in between.
<br><br>
Jamie:  Mola, Do you miss your mama?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Jamie:  Do you miss you daddy?<br>
Board:  Yes<br>
<br>
Keith kept singing, and when he started singing Christmas songs the cursor would move back and forth from the Sun and the Moon. That went on for at least 15 minutes. Constantly. When we asked if we could leave, he would move the cursor to No. We had to tell him goodbye for about 10 minutes before he moved from NO to goodbye. We haven't played since.  And at this rate, we don't know if we would ever again.
