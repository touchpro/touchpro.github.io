On October 14, 2007 I received an e-mail from Allison B. about another interesting ouija board experience:
<br><br><br>
Another experience with Rick was last night. We were asking things like how many kids I would have...he said 2. So I asked if it would be twins, and he said &quot;d- well maybe.&quot;
<br><br>
I always feel comfortable with Rick, and I know it's because he is younger. He is 17.  He died at age 12, but he also sometimes gets more intimate, like puts his replies in our minds - like when he told us how old he was when he died, my friend and I didn't want to ask how but both got the thought of a car accident in our heads at the same time. We asked him if he put these thoughts in our heads, and he said yes.
<br><br>
He also made fun of my friend, saying that she'd be a stripper when she grows up because &quot;boobs are good&quot;...and she has big ones =]
<br><br>
He also told me I would be a forensic scientist (my dream job), and he told me my husband's name would be Adam (which another spirit also told me).  He said that my friend and I would go to UCLA together.
<br><br>
Rick always has fun things to say, so I'll probably be back with more stories.
