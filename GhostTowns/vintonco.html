Vinton County is probably the most heavily-wooded county in the state.  Here you'll find artifacts from the mining and iron furnace industries, and many ghost towns with relics still intact.  Today it's one of our poorest counties, but it is one of the most beautiful, with its own resort community--Lake Hope--and thousands of acres of the Wayne National Forest.  The county seat is McArthur.  Below is a list of ghost towns buried in the backwoods of Vinton County.
