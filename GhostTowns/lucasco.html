Lucas County, home to Toledo, once contained many smaller villages which cropped up long the lakeshore or beside the Maumee River in the Great Black Swamp.  Many of them were eaten up by the city, while others simply dried up and disappeared.  The ones I know of are listed here.

Allen Junction
<dd>
Sylvania Twp.
<dd>
This junction on the Toleo & Western Electric Line Railroad is gone, but marked by the waiting room for passengers and red block housing for the AC/DC electricity converter, both of which are still standing.
<dt>
Auburndale
<dd>
Washington Twp.
<dd>
Town platted in 1873 by Amasa Bishop, south of Woodlawn Cemetery and west of the New York & Central tracks.  Toledo absorbed it by 1903.
<dt>
Au-to-kee's Village
<dd>
Swanton Twp.
<dd>
Ottawa Chief Au-to-kee had a village and trading post in the northern part of Swanton Township, near Swan Creek, around 1837.  Luther Dodge operated a store in the village in order to trade with the Indians.  After Chielf Au-to-kee got drunk and froze to death one night, the village disbanded.

Awpatowajowin
<dd>
Providence Twp.
<dd>
The Ottawa also called this town Kinjoano's Town after the local Chief, but its more common name means "halfway."  It served as a halfway point between not only the mouth of the Maumee and Fort Defiance, but also Detroit, MI and Fort Wayne, IN.  Major events here include the accidental killing of Chief Kinjoano's only son Muccutamong, by his cousin Peway during a tribal corn dance.  Peway had been drinking and was deeply sorry.  This is also the location of the "Council Elm," which was destroyed in 1879 by a storm but was hailed as a landmark because of the talks held beneath it in the years after the 1795 Treaty of Greenville.  Resentful because of violations of the Treaty, violence and unrest were widespread.  Chiefs Ottokee and Nackichewah asked for a meeting with Indian Agent Jackson--President Jackson's half brother--and were granted a council where they spoke eloquently of the deception of the "palefaces" and the many violations of the Treaty.  Jackson gave his word that the Ottawa would receive retribution for the damages--a word which was kept, unlike so many other promises made by white people to the Indians.

Bailey
<dd>
Providence Twp.
<dd>
Railroad town on the Toledo, St. Louis & Western; also known as Bailey Station.  Never officially platted.
<dt>
Barnes' Corners
<dd>
Spencer Twp.
<dd>
Crossroads town and farmers' trading post.
<dt>
Berkey PO
<dd>
? Twp.
<dd>
Before the Civil War it was Riga, and the postmaster was Lathrop "Berkey" Berkeybile, which gave the crossroads town the name Berkey's Corners.  The postal department officially changed it to Berkey in 1865.  Earlier there had been a number of shops, including (in 1840), A.D. Sanderson's general store, Dr. M.M. Mason's practice, blacksmith Jacob B. Gillian, and, somewhat later, Grange Hall #1394.  An Irishman named James Farley had established a religious sect there in 1837 which was known briefly as Farley's Class, then sometime after the war became the Berkey ME Church under Reverend James Evans.  Much later it was a stop on the Toledo & Western Electric Railroad.

Bono
<dd>
Jerusalem Twp.
<dd>
This swamp town grew up on the vast holdings of Detroit industrialist Eber Brock Ward, who drained the swamp with a thirty-foot-wide canal roughly following Cedar Creek.  He intended to use the trees to build and fuel a fleet of ships, and bought more than 8000 acres of land in 1844.  A community called New Jerusalem grew near the mouth of the canal, marked by a sawmill, boarding house, racetrack with stables, and the shipyard.  Ships like the <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Mars</i>, <i>Herschel</i>, and <i>Leland</i> were produced here.  Brothers Dan and Bogue Shepard began buying land from Ward and re-selling it, and after Ward's death the name New Jerusalem fell into disuse and was replaced with Shepardsville.  Since there was already a Shepardsville in Ohio, when the citizens applied for a post office in 1898 they were forced to come up with a new name.  Townsfolk met and came up with Bono, named after an old Ottawa indian who refused to leave the area when white settlers moved in.  By then most of the lumber had burned in the big fire of 1895, during which the underlayer of pulpy muck smoldered and burned many people and animals who broke through.  From 1898 until 1973 the post office operated while the population of Bono shrunk.  Today only a few houses and the name of the curve on Route 2 remain to mark the location of the town.

Centennial
<dd>
Sylvania Twp.
<dd>
This small town with a school and a quarry was named for the 1876 celebration of the nation's 100th birthday.  It was home to a popular outdoor dance floor and concert venue--Centennial Terrace Gardens.  In 1930 the quarry was filled with water and turned into a swimming hole.  Today it's part of the Lucas County Parks System, and can be found (rather, not found) at the intersection of Centennial and Erie Streets in Toledo.
<dt>
East Manhatten
<dd>
? Twp.
<dd>
Town located near the mouth of the Maumee River at Lake Erie, on the site of an Ottawa Village (1683) and French settlement (1807).  The Ottawa were granted the land under an 1833 treaty, and in 1836 it was purchased from them by the East Manhatten Land and Railroad Co.  They developed land on the east side of the Maumee for the Ohio Railroad Co.--today marked by coal, iron ore, and railroad docks.
<dt>
Fort Industry
<dd>
? Twp.
<dd>
The Fort and town stood in what is now downtown Toledo, on the north bank of Swan Creek near the corner of modern-day Monroe and Summit Streets.  Historians disagree about when and why it was built--sometime between 1794 and 1796, and probably as protection against the British in Canada.  A big treaty was signed there July 4, 1805, ceding much of northern Ohio's Indian lands to the US (which paid $1,000) and the Western Reserve of Connecticut (which paid $16,000 through the Connecticut Land Co.).  The Fort was abandoned shortly thereafter and decayed until it was levelled in 1842 or '43 and the Fort Industry Block was built in Toledo.  Archaeologists have recently done excavation work there and have uncovered lots of artifacts from the fort/trading post days.  They've established something of a timeline for Fort Industry:  1670 - French trading post; 1760s - Ceded to Britain; 1794 - British Indian refugee center following Battle of Fallen Timbers; 1796 - Surrendered, along with Fort Miami, to the US; 1812 - British re-took it; 1813 - US re-took it from Indians.
<dt>
Hickory
<dd>
Adams Twp.
<dd>
Harvey Kellogg, teacher and postmaster, established the town of Hickory sometime before 1888; it appears on maps from that year.
<dt>
Java
<dd>
Spencer Twp.
<dd>
Also known as Frankfort or Frankfort Corners.  It was begun as a post office town, but it gathered enough settlement around it that it remained in existence through the 1960s.
