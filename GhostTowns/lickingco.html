Licking County is located just east of Franklin County and is the home of Newark, Granville, and Pataskala.  The old National Road ran through Licking County, as does Route 40 today.  It's the home of popular tourist attraction and Jimmy Buffet venue Buckeye Lake.  I visit Kirkersville every summer to buy fireworks at the outlet store there.  I've also done some research into the many ghost towns in Licking County.  If the spread of Columbus continues at its current rate, I think we'll see many more towns give up the ghost in years to come.

Claylick
<dd>
Madison Twp.
<dd>
The interesting name of this village is said to have arisen when pioneer Henry Johnson first came to this area he observed deer licking at the salty clay along the riverbank.  The post office here operated from 1852 until 1981.  Two families, the Johnsons and the Hickeys, owned the stores and mills in the town.  Claylick contained a gristmill, a sawmill, a railroad station for the B & O line, a blacksmith shop, a cream station, a couple of general stores, and a post office.  There was also an interurban station about a quarter of a mile north of town.  The sawmill was water powered long after such a power source had gone out of vogue, and used a vertical saw blade to cut railroad ties.  Eventually Claylick was killed by floods.  The disastrous 1913 flood destroyed the main industries in the town--the sawmill and the gristmill--and the 1959 flood finished the job by convincing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a dam and floodplain there.  They used eminent domain to buy the town.

More stores were built, and permanent housing sprang up.  The town's name was ultimately changed to Hanover, after the city in Germany, so the town could get a post office.  The canal passed through Hanover, and for a while it was an important city, handling lumber and stone shipments.  A railroad also ran through.  Hanover was also called Natchez Under the Hill because it was a haven for highwaymen, horse thieves, and counterfeiters.  When the Dillon Dam project began in 1960 the town was taken over and a new Hanover grew up north of the old town.

Located at the intersection of Hickman Road and County Road 243, along the banks of Rocky Fork Creek.  In the early 1800's a high grade of iron ore was discovered in the hillsides of Mary Ann Township.  A sawmill was constructed in 1815 out of sandstone, and lumber was cut to feed the furnace.  Next, the furnace was built, named for founder David Moore's wife Mary Ann.  The furnace was the first industry in Licking County, and it continued operating for the next forty years.  It was famous for its ornate cookstoves.  Workers wore brightly colored uniforms and were paid fifty cents for two weeks work.  The town was so prosperous that it was once considered a candidate for the county seat.  Then, in 1860, the furnace burned down (how's that for irony?).  For years a pile of rocks was visible where it had been, but that's long gone.  Now there's a house which once served as a tavern and an operating school.

He stipulated that anytime the Universalists weren't using the church, they had to let any other denomination use it.  Lots of other religions took advantage of this--among them the "New Lights" of Cook Settlement fame.  They were also referred to as the "Dunkard People," since their denomination placed special emphasis on baptism.  The church was later rededicated and moved to the Hartford Fairgrounds.
