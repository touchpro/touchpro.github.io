This cemetery belongs to a town in Madison County which doesn't exist anymore:  New Hampton.
<p>
The story of New Hampton is told on a historical marker.  It sprang up on the Old State Road, also known as Ludlow's Road, which ran from Franklinton to Springfield in the very first days of Ohio's statehood.  New Hampton was the forerunner to West Jefferson, just as the Old State Road was the forerunner to the National Road, so when Route 40 replaced the Franklinton-Springfield trail, West Jefferson filled the niche formerly filled by New Hampton, and the latter town dried up and blew away.  Today all that's left is the graveyard and part of what was once the road.

Special thanks to Dave for the photographs and tip about this ghost town.
