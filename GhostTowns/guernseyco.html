Guernsey County is home to Cambridge, as well as Quaker City and Old Washington.  It's a fairly rural county in which most of the towns are at least semi-ghost towns.  Of course, there are lots of real ghost towns, as well.  My thanks to Andrea McEnaney for compiling and sending me this list.

<dt>
Claysville
<dd>
Westland Twp.
<dd>
Town platted in 1828 by Ford Barnes.  Mainly a tobacco town, it had a population of 205 in 1850.  The railroad bypassed it, however, and it deteriorated from there.

Divide

Wills Twp.

Town platted in 1842 by David Drew.  Its location was where the Guernsey County Fairgrounds are located today, at the east end of Old Washington.
<dt>
Elizabethtown
<dd>
Wills Twp.
<dd>
Town platted in 1832 by Jacob Weller, located two miles east of Old Washington.  Its greatest population was 217 in 1860, but today its population is zero, since I-70 runs right through the place where it used to stand.
<dt>
Frankfort
<dd>
Millwood Twp.
<dd>
Also called Smithwood, this town was laid out in 1804 by Joseph Smith--the first town laid out in Guernsey County.  Today it is referred to as Lost Town, since nobody can figure out where it was.  Supposedly it was at the place where Putney Ridge intersects Zane's Trace, but since they don't intersect it's sort of confusing.
<dt>
Frisco
<dd>
Monroe Twp.
<dd>
Post office town located on Rocky Fork Creek.
<dt>
Londonderry
<dd>
Londonderry Twp.
<dd>
Town platted by Robert Wilken.  Its greatest population was 93, achieved in 1850.  It contained a general store, a harness shop, and a grist mill.
<dt>
Middlebourne
<dd>
Oxford Twp.
<dd>
Town platted in 1827 by Benjamin Masters.  It was originally known as Middletown, and it was once the site of the first tavern in Guernsey County, built by Thomas Hays.  The site of the tavern has been partially excavated in a survey of the old National Road.
<dt>
Odell
<dd>
Monroe Twp.
<dd>
Post office town.

<dt>
Winterset
<dd>
Madison Twp.
<dd>
Town laid out in 1836 by Isaac Bonnell.  It was originally called Winchester but was changed to avoid confusion with another Winchester, this one in Adams County.  Its greatest population was 197.  It was located on Route 22 and was a stop on the Underground Railroad.  I wonder if they named it this because of the proximity of the town of Somerset.
