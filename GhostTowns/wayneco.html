Wayne County in northeastern Ohio is the home of Wooster, and site of plenty of wooded hills and ridges which once contained mining towns.  The towns I know anything about are listed below.

Rogue's Hollow is a true ghost town, a former mining community located south of Doylestown which was famous as a haven for criminals.  It eventually faded away but is kept alive today by the Rogue's Hollow Historical Society and a book written in 1958 by Russell Frey.
