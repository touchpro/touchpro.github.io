Franklin County is the home of Columbus, where I live, and it's also the home to hundreds of ghost towns, most of which were absorbed by Columbus as it expanded.  This is an ongoing process--dozens of outlying communities are in the process of being annexed and homogenized as Columbus spreads like a deadly plague.  Okay, maybe that's a little harsh, but it still sucks that many of these towns are no longer identifiable as anything more than a stretch of freeway or an intersection littered with corporate gas stations.

Billy Wyandot's Camp
<dd>
Washington Township
<dd>
An Indian village located about one mile north of Dublin on the banks of the Indian Run River.  Many of the 150 Indians who resided here in 1809 enlisted in the army under president William Henry Harrison during the War of 1812.  Among these was Captain Turtle, who went on to participate in the Battle of Tippecanoe.  Their chief was known as Billy Wyandot.  The daughter of the man who owned the land--Samuel Sells--once caused a panic by taking shooting lessons during the day.  Her mother heard the shots and raised the alarm:  "the Indians are coming!"  Nearby settlers headed for Franklinton, but Sells' daughter quickly explained and calmed things down.
<dt>
Blendon Four Corners/Blendon Corner
<dd>
Blendon Twp.
<dd>
This crossroads community was located at the intersection of Granville Road and the Columbus-Westerville Pike.  It was originally known as Harrison Post Office, until Harrison Township was changed to Blendon Township.  The first tavern in Blendon Township was opened here in 1921 by Francis C. Olmstead.  The residents were then offered a depot if they could raise $500 to build it.  The money was raised and a depot and Y-track was placed in Blendon Four Corners.

Central College
<dd>
Blendon Twp.
<dd>
Located south of Hoover Dam on Sunbury Road.  Amalthea took its name from mythology--the goat that nourished Jupiter.  In the 1820s and early 1830s Ebenezer Washburn conducted a school at Amalthea, teaching "the rudiment of the classics," psychology, ethics, "Butler's Analogy," and higher mathematics.  In 1835, Squire Timothy Lee, who owned much of the land, offered 100 acres to the Presbyterian Church for the establishment of an institution of higher learning.  Thus was born the Blendon Institute, which got its post office on September 23, 1841.  Lee built four college buildings for the new school:  a three-story brick dormitory, a dwelling house, a recitation building, and a chapel.  Reverend L.A. Sawyer was the college's first president, with Ebenezer Washburn relegated to assistant duties.  In 1842 the school changed its name to Central College.  Stores, blacksmiths, and millers opened up shop in the area, kept in business by the college, which flourished briefly, only to lose business to the other schools which cropped up in the state capital nearby--not the least of which was Ohio State University.  By 1901 Central College had closed its doors.  For a while a home for the blind occupied the buildings; today they're used by the city of Westerville for public functions.

Clover Settlement
<dd>
Prairie Twp.
<dd>
Town formed by the Clover family, who were from Ross County and, before that, Virginia, in 1913.  The family had ten sons and two daughters.  Two of the boys--Peter and Joshua--were known as the "brag hunters" of the area, and Peter was eventually the first Justice of the Peace elected in Prairie Township.  In 1858 all that was left of Clover Settlement was a Methodist Church.

<dt>
Franklinton
<dd>
Franklin twp.
<dd>
Franklinton today is known as the Bottoms, an economically depressed section of town just west of downtown Columbus.  Although it's hard to tell, this town pre-dates the city which has smothered it by a good fifty years, and was one of the first settlements west of the Ohio River.  It was founded in 1797 by Lucas Sullivant, who decided on the site because he found fertile Indian cornfields in the lowland on the west bank of the Scioto River.  He laid out the first street, which he called Gift Street, because parcels of land would be given to people who chose to settle in the largely untamed area.  A town grew up as people moved in; a hotel, a jail, and a general store were built.  When a capital city was to be created for the state of Ohio, Franklinton was a contender, helped along by its geographically central location.  However, Franklinton had--and still has--one major drawback:  floods.  The lands flooded regularly, so the new capital was laid out on the high bank of the Scioto and named arbitrarily for Christopher Columbus.  My dad still remembers the times when the Bottoms flooded in the 1960s; he said you could drive on I-70 and see the damage.  Today Sullivant is remembered by two major Columbus street names, but Franklinton is buried; not a single original building remains of the settlement.

Mudsock
<dd>
Norwich Twp.
<dd>
Established in the 1850's, Mudsock was named for its muddy streets.  A farmer once lost his shoes and socks in the mire after his horse got stuck, and the town was named.  A Methodist Church was established here in 1876.  When it came time to name the church the townspeople got one vote each, to be submitted with five cents.  Ann Colwell, wife of church founder John Colwell, bought $25.00 worth of votes--so the church was called the Colwell Methodist Church.  Today the place where Mudsock was located is an intersection on Roberts Road on the west side of Columbus, near Reebok Drive.  Margaret Yost wrote an article on Mudsock in 1956, and Randy McNutt profiled it in his book <i>Ghosts</i>.

<dd>

<dd>
Located at the intersection of Granville Road and the Columbus-Central College Pike, on the banks of the Big Walnut Creek.  Pinhook got its name when a local man named Layman Day commented that the town's founding father was so stingy that the devil could catch his soul on a pinhook baited with a five-cent piece.  The name stuck somehow, and the town of Portersburg was changed to Pinhook.
