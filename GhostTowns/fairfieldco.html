Fairfield County is home to Lancaster and the birthplace of William Tecumseh Sherman.  Today it's a suburb county to Columbus, but it still contains some nice woods and the beginning of the Hocking Hills.  A number of towns faded out of existence in the countryside surrounding Lancaster; scroll down to read about them.
