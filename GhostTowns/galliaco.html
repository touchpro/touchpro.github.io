Gallia County is a rural, sparsely-populated county on the southestern edge of the state, just across the river from West Virginia.  The ghost towns I've investigated from within its borders are listed below.

This modern ghost town is still in the process of becoming one, following AEP's 2002 buyout offer.  The power company's coal-fueled Gavin Power Plant had so polluted the area that they settled a class-action lawsuit by purchasing every home and business in the tiny village and giving them just a couple of years to move out.  Ultimately it will become a riverside dumping ground for AEP.  <a href = "../Cheshire/cheshire.html">Click here</a> to read more.
