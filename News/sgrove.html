Post Staff Report

<br>
<br>
It's more than just a cemetery. Much more.
<p>
In fact, a one-time Spring Grove Cemetery general manager called cemetery ''a harsh word. We like to think we are a park with a fine collection of plant material.''
<p>
Spring Grove is today an wonderful mix of horticulture and history, monuments and mausoleums, birds and beauty.
<p>
Founded in 1845, the original area of 166 slightly hilly acres was purchased for $16,000. It was named Spring Grove because of the numerous springs and ancient groves of trees on the property.
<p>
Early leaders like Adolph Strauch, Dr. Daniel Drake, Robert Buchanan, Timothy Walker, Salmon P. Chase and Henry Probasco set the course that has made Spring Grove the nation's largest non-profit cemetery with more than 700 acres.
<p>
Much has changed in over 150 years. In 1845, a rule stated: ''Horses must not be left without the driver.'' For almost 100 years, owners could enter only with tickets for themselves and their guests, who were excluded on Sundays.
<p>
Automobiles were admitted in 1911; the great flood inundated Spring Grove in 1937; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976; and in 1993 a patent for a new dogwood tree was issued to Spring Grove.
<p>
Now called Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum, it today is a ''place of repose for people from all walks of life.''
