LONDON, Ohio --- Marvin Lee Smith Jr. stood before a Madison County judge yesterday and denied molesting a 15-year-old Westland High School cheerleader 17 years ago.
<p>
He is charged with corruption of a minor, a third-degree felony. Smith, who once served nearly nine years in an Ohio prison for rape, kidnapping and robbery, was arrested in North Carolina last month.
<p>
An Ohio law that took effect in 2005 requires DNA collection from all felons. Investigators only recently matched Smith's sample to evidence in this old case.
<p>
The cheerleader, Jessica Lyn Keen, wasn't just raped. Authorities say her attacker snatched her from a Weinland Park bus stop in Columbus on March 15, 1991, forced her into a vehicle and drove her to a Madison County cemetery.
<p>
There, she got away. But someone hunted her down and stalked her through the graveyard. Eventually, she was caught.
<p>
A cemetery visitor found her naked body two days later. Jessica had been
<p>
beaten to death.  It was a horrific crime that haunted investigators and devastated the girl's family.  It has never been solved.
<p>
Eight deputies were posted around the courtroom yesterday, and Judge Robert D. Nichols set bond at $1 million.  Jessica's parents and her sister showed obvious relief that there is now little chance Smith will get out of jail.
<p>
Nichols said a high bond is necessary because he expects it could soon become a death-penalty case. Madison County Prosecutor Steve Pronai said he is awaiting additional test results on the old evidence and that Smith will likely be charged in the girl's death.
<p>
Smith was represented by an attorney from the Ohio Public Defender's Office.
