Schools may close, but memories of lessons learned there will remain.
<p>
The Dayton Public Schools reorganization plan means Patterson High School and Cleveland, Whittier and Jane Addams elementary schools will shut down in June, as will the Longfellow School, an administrative center.
<p>
If you have a fond memory of being a student, teacher or worker at one of these schools that you'd like to share with readers, please mail them to School Days, c/o James Lloyd, Dayton Daily News, 45 S. Ludlow St., Dayton, Ohio 45402.
