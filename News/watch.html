Welcome to the News Watch section of Forgotten Ohio.  This portion of the site is intended to keep you up-to-date on news items and events related to forgotten or haunted Ohio places.  I live in Columbus, so I might have a slight bias that way, but I'll be checking sources from other cities regularly.  If you find an article or story which you think would be good for this section of the site, please e-mail me at <a href = "mailto:  ">  </a>.
