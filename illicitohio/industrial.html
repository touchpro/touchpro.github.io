    I really didn't see much of it until a return trip with my Father in 2005.

            always called Industrial Waste Yella Gate, or Yellow Gate because 
            of the small steel gate that blocked the entrance road from trespassers. 
            By the time the gate was added, I believe the facility was only in 
            partial use for the purpose of decontamination. The spot outside of 
            the gate however was in full use as a polular drinking/partying spot 
            for teens. It was in the middle of nowhere and out of out Police Force's 
            jurisdiction. </font></p>

            from a hillside somewhere. He could not recall which facility he had 
            shown us because there is another chemical dump between this one and 
            our house. I'm laughing as I type this because that sounds so crazy

    The company does still check the grounds for seepage and such. I don't recall 
    much else about the grounds, but I do remember that we were not allowed to 
    grow a garden for part of my youth (possibly due to the other checmical dump) 
    and that my parents mentioned that occasionally on rainy humid days the air 
    would make your eyes water. That sounds worse than it was.</font></p>

    know which of the facilities was the problem if either. This is only my opinion/speculation

    always had lurking in our backyard is really now pretty much low key. I'd

    have this vague mental image of two redish orange ponds with the sun reflecting 
    off of them. Outside of that I've always wondered what it looked like.</font></p>
