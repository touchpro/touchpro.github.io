  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Now I know the site is supposed to be IllicitOHIO, 
    but I as the SteelMill exploration shows, I do travel out of state from time 
    to time. My latest vacation took me to Mimai Florida to enjoy the sites, sounds, 
    and smells of the south beach area. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">As with any large 
            city, Miami had its fair share of empty, abandoned, closed, crumbling, 
            etc, buildings. Miami seemed to have strict rules governing their 
            abandoned buildings so most had large wooden fences keeping people 
            like me out. I wasn't willing to force my way in to a place that I 
            shouldn't be in, so I thought I'd be leaving the city in need of a 
            good fix and no where to find it (ok, so maybe that's over doing it)... 
            Just when I though all had failed, I spotted the Marina Stadium off 
            of a causeway leading to Virgina Key. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I had gone out to a state 
    park with my Girl friend and was on the mundane trip back to the hotel, when 
    out of the corner of my eye I spotted the top of the Stadium. The grafitti 
    gave away that this place was probably abandoned, so I cut across a few lanes 
    of traffic and darted in to the old parking lot. The lot was being used that 
    day for a tennis function farther out on the key, but that didn't stop me 
    from doing some innocent poking around.</font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> I drove 
          around the lot, and even go out to take the next few pictures. I took 
          a few from the lot, then approached the stadium. I was able to walk 
          right in to the stadium's rear cooridore area where I snapped a few 
          more. I looked for a way out to the main seating area/stage area, when 
          I came across a park ranger, cop, security guard, or random guy in uniform. 
          I figured it was best to beat it before he noticed me, so I left... 
          quickly. </font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So as it ends up, I went back to the stadium 
    the day before I left. My girlfriend was thrilled to death that she got to 
    sit in a rental car on our last day of vacation while I walked around a rotting 
    stadium that I had previsouly been chased out of by a park ranger. </font></p>

            rooms that I didn't get pictures of due to time constraints... more 
            on that in a minute. I entered the building and had to swing around 
            a fenced gate to get to the front section. There were places I could 
            have just walked straight in to, but I didn't realize this at the

    booth hanging in the center. It looked rusted. My fear of water kept me from 
    jumping the small gap over to the barge. I made it to the top of the seating

          Bees/Wasps/etc are the other major fear of mine, so I wasn't going to

          picture of the barge, I turned around only to find my old friend the 
          park ranger stanging a few rows up, facing toward the back of the stadium, 
          I assume looking for me. How this guy didn't see me, I have no clue. 
          I must have blended in with the cement due to my pale skin with random 
          red burns (colorful like the grafitti).... <br>

            any more pictures. I assumed he was on my tail. Once in the rental 
            car, I saw him come out of the building and start looking my way. 
            Thank goodness I was in a rental. I swung the car around narrowly 
            missing various fences and floored it out of there. That was the last
