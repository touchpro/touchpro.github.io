  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">My Journey through the 
    Fort Hayes property was another of many trips I made on a whim. I was driving 
    around looking for something to get in to when I passed the Barraks. I'd been 
    in before, but hadn't been able to see as much as I would have liked to see. 
    Sometimes good places to explore are right under your nose. This was one of 
    those times. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Fort 
            Hayes, named after the President, was in operation as far back as 
            the Civil War. There are many photos around that show the property 
            over the years. Many of the buildings have gone unchanged since that 
            time. Today those buildings stand, but barely. They are in extremely 
            poor condition to the point of not being safe.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">My 
            first trip in to the grounds was back in the old early days of the

            Ohio</font></a>. I didn't get enough pictures to make a section for

    plenty of pictures, but many of them have that signature cheap digital camera 
    blurr. Maybe I just can't hold a camera still. It was a real bummer that they 
    didn't turn out better because some of them had some cool looking lighting 
    due to the time of day and position of the sun. </font></p>

          order to do so. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Some of the buildings are currently 
          in reuse for the school of Arts. Those which are not in use are probably 
          beyond restoration unfortunately. Hopefull I am wrong because there 
          are some really cool buildings.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The vibe on the grounds is really weird. 
    There were bums living in the rooms in the old officers building on our inital 
    trip. There is a really weird irony about a homeless person sitting on the 
    former balcony of a Sargent, then again, some of our Vietnam vets would probably 
    beg to differ. Regardless, I think its sort of neat to see people still getting 
    use out of it. As cheesey as this will sound, there is something charming 
    about these old workhorse buildings still serving their purpose. That all 
    being said, I didn't see signs of the homeless people on my return trip.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The students of the 
            art school, and plenty of others I'm sure, have made the grounds a 
            canvas for everything from political art to sloppy grafitti. There 
            really wasn't enough time or daylight to explor all of the buildings 
            fully. I also was using a keychain led light as a flash light, so 
            some of the buildings were dark to the point where I couldn't see 
            anything at all. I can only brave that for so long before my brain 
            starts to wonder if there is someone in there with me.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Walking around the property alone can get 
    a little freaky, but overall, this is a pretty good visit for someone just 
    looking to see some old buildings and columbus history. You can easily see 
    the outsides of all of these buildings in a safe and 100% legal mannor... 
    which is rare on this site. If you're looking for an interesting place to 
    walk around on a nice summer evening, this is your place. What better way 
    to see something other than the usual boring park stuff, and pay respect to 
    those who served.</font></p>

            the buildings is not going to be easy. As of my last visit, the property 
            was fenced enough to keep most people out. I ended up walking right 
            in through an open gate, but had that gate been locked, it wouldn't 
            be an easy entrance.</font></p>

            the pictures won't be so bad that they ruin the experience. The camera 
            simply wouldn't snap a clean picture. I didn't get too many in the 
            psy ops building because I started to spook myself out and simply 
            couldn't relax enough to get any good pics.</font></p>
