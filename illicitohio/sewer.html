  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">This page will tell of the trip in to the 
    sewers near 3rd Ave, just a short distance from the Lennox Theaters. Outside 
    of this tunnel there was a sign that warned that the contents could be harmful. 
    Needless to say, sortly after reading that sign, my dumbass fell in the sewer 
    water.</font></p>

          sewer trip is one of the earlier features of the original site. We had 
          heard about this sewer that was supposed to be an interesting trip back 
          under the city. It was kind of interesting to see, but certainly no 
          worth the hassel that it caused once I fell in to the water. This water 
          literally smelled like shit. There is no kind of gentle way to say it.

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Basically what happened 
    was that I decided to climb down a ladder to get a closer look at what was 
    on the other side of this large steel door that at the end of the river of 
    poo that was passing below us. Well, lets talk about everything leading up 
    to that graceful moment first...</font></p>

    <tr> 
      <td width="44%" height="296"><p align="center"><a href="sewer/sewer05.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="sewer/sewer05.jpg" width="340" border="0"></a></p>

      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Basically it looks 
          like a sewer inside. There really isn't much more to it. Its basically 
          a cement tunnel with an occasional brick stack leading up to a manhole 
          cover. The air smelled like crap. I have no idea why we kept going, 
          but we were curious. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The Acoustics were cool in the tunnel 
          because we could hear the echo of the sound of running water for a long 
          time before we ever saw any running water.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The way it is set up is that the sewer 
    is down below the level we were on. If things get out of hand, they can close 
    off a gate which floods that lower river of water and fills up a small room 
    which then allows it to overflow in to the tunnel we were walking in. This 
    then drains it out to the river. I assume this is only used if things really 
    get bad because I can't imagine the smell that would follow such a procedure.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">So now to me falling 
            in. We could see that there was a steel door under that could be used 
            to block the river below us. We weren't sure if there was anything 
            on the other side of it, so I climbed down a small ladder (about 10 
            inches wide) to the stand on the bricks you see to the right and look 
            down the river to see what was down there. Well as luck would have 
            it... those bricks are slippery. Very.</font></p>

  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Right about the time my foot hit the bricks 
    I realized they were as slick as ice. I started to fall and managed to jump 
    toward the other side of the stream of whatever. Of course it was slippery 
    too, so I had to jump back immeadiately... I kept this dance up until I was 
    able to grab the ladder and twist myself around to climb back up. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">In the end I managed to walk away with 
    a big cement scrape on my arm... most certainly filled with bacteria like 
    you can't imagine, and shoes and socks soaked with poo water. I also had splashed 
    this stuff all over myself, but most importantly to me, I DIDN'T end up sliding 
    through that steel door and completely in to the deeper public sewers under 
    the city because I really don't think I would have been able to get back out.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Andy (<a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com" target="_blank">forgottenoh.com</a>) 
    was kind enough to venture in to biglots or oddlots and get me some nice Ford 
    MotorSport socks which I still have to this day. I dried my shoes with the 
    McDonalds hand dryer nearby.</font></p>
