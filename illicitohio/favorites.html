          to be my favorite pictures on the site. These aren't necessarily going 
          to be the best pictures, only my favorites and a brief run down of why. 
          So why should you care what my favorites are? You probably don't and 
          shouldn't. Its just an excuse for me to do something additional on the 
          site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New">As always, this isn't a photography site. 
          I suck at taking pictures, so this isn't me bragging or trying to write 
          off pictures as photography, this is just a section where I can look 
          back at some of the stuff I've taken pictures of...</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New">This may be a lousy picture, but its one of 
        my favorites because it was taken from the area at the base of the tower 
        as I hid in the tall grass from the security spotlight that was flashing 
        around looking for me. I was thrilled to have just accomplished my task 
        of going through the tower yet I was scared knowing I was being looked 
        for, I was inside two fenced areas, and I was alone. This was probably 
        the best time I had ever had in relation to the website, so this lousy 
        picture is a great reminder.</font></p>

        know why. Saving for the internet actually really ruined the color of 
        the tanks, but the original really looks cool. This place is very very 
        close to my childhood home and for some strange reason it was always sort 
        of taboo. We never really knew what was back there but we knew it was 
        a chemical dump. Even once I got older I never bothered to go back there, 
        and then after all of those years of wondering... it was just two empty 
        silos sitting there empty.</font></p>

            cool natural colors inside of this building. It was way cooler to 
            see in real life, but this picture sort of captures the really strange 
            colors given by the white powder everywhere mixed with the corregated 
            plastic on the windows. I'm not sure where the purple comes from, 
            or if it just looks purple because of all of the green?</font></p>

              sound cheesey and cliche, but this picture is one of my favorites 
              because it is of the mill that my father worked at for over 20 years. 
              Actually he wasn't in this building that entire time, but this building 
              is what I remember of his job. He spent many long nights miserable 
              inside of this building so that he could provide for us. The mill 
              eventually shut down during the 80s and our family was turned upside 
              down. I never appreciated the stress this must of caused until I 
              grew up. I was always bitter toward the mill, although I realize 
              now it wasn't the mills fault of course, but me going through it 
              before they tore it down really gave me an appreciate for everything 
              my parents went through for us. </font></p>

                      is where it was left off after the fire was done and the 
                      damage was cut away. The coaster was a top coaster at the
