  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">This was the 3rd stop on 
    my Pittsburgh Area Nike Site Self Tour. This one did not go as planned. First 
    I only had it on the map with basic cordinates, so I wasn't sure exactly where 
    it was located. The marker on the map that I printed made me think that I 
    should go down a back road that essentially led me on about a 40 minute wild 
    goose chase. This was poor planning on my part. I then found my way back to 
    the main road that I had been on, and proceeded to drive past the base twice 
    before realizing where it was located... finally, I find the control site.

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">As 
            you can see in the main pitcture above, there were signs... Dog signs. 
            Of course I considered that maybe they were just empty warnings. I 
            got out... stood around for a while... listened for dogs, considered 
            my options, and eventually left. It looked relatively abandoned to 
            me, but I wasn't about to cross no-trespassing and beware of dog signs. 
            Instead I'd look for the launch site. Strangely, as I'd eventually 
            find out, the control sites are better protected than the launch sites. 
            If you completely lost, its because you're coming in to the middle 
            of a story. Check the <a href="elramanike.html">Elrama</a> or <a href="herminienike.html">Herminie</a> 
            sites for a better explantion. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">In this instance, the two 
    sites are very close to one another. The Launch site was directly accross 
    the street. I headed that way. It became quickly clear that this site was 
    still in use. I had read that a machine shop used the launch site and that 
    ended up being the case. In my own obnoxious way, I decided just to ride through 
    and hope no one minded. I was wrong. I rounded the assembly building pictured 
    above and was stopped by a bearded man in a golf cart. He was friendly, but 
    curious as to what I was doing. I told him that I was curious and he advised 
    me to ask the owner if it was ok to look around a little. We went back to 
    the former barraks which was not used as offices, and I meant a nice gentleman 
    by the name of Chip. I explained my intentions and eventually Chip agreed 
    to show me around... but not without cautioning that he isn't able to give 
    people tours... so don't show up there looking for one. He's a busy guy and 
    was kind enough to take me around. He also showed me some models that a former 
    base assignee had built of the site and they were amazing... very cool.</font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Chip 
          couldn't have been more kind. He drove me out to the battery and took 
          me below ground. He took his valuable time to explain the elevator system, 
          what he had to do to rehab the site, and how the program originally 
          worked. It could not have been better. I really can't thank him enough. 
          He had spent time fixing and maintaining the lift. We discussed the 
          auto leveling system, which he once had to repair, as well as the pumps 
          he used vs the much faster pumps the military used and removed from 
          the hydraulics. Chip showed me the filters, the small control space 
          at the bottom of the hatch behind blast doors... pretty much everything 
          you could want to see. Out of respect for his privacy and property, 
          I didn't take pictures. Stick with me... You will see in one of these.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Chip filled me in on a lot of details... 
    the basics of how the system worked, that people from the launch side weren't 
    allowed on the control side, and vice versa, how the missiles were assmebled, 
    fueled, what the basic buidings were (generator house, bunker, barraks, assembly, 
    etc). Basically anything I could think to ask. Again, he doesn't give tours, 
    so please don't go asking for the tour the guy on the internet got. Over all, 
    Chip made my day. I finally got to see inside a missle battery. I didn't get 
    many photos, but I'd make up for that at the <a href="irwinnike.html">Irwin 
    site.</a> One additional detail that Chip helped me out with... the beware 
    of dogs sign across the street is legit. His advice... stay the heck away 
    from the control site. Someone owns it, they have dogs, and they may or may 
    not live there. Keep Out!</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">We talked a little about if anything had 
    ever left the site in terms of missiles, and if I understood correctly, one 
    was fired, as a test, shortly after the site was built. I'd love to have seen 
    that. These suckers go about 1600 mph, almost as fast as the beat up Honda 
    I drove there!!</font></p>
