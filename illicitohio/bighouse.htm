    <TD><FONT size=4>The prison was built in Columbus, Ohio in 1834. It was 
      the second Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, with the first being in Scioto 
      Street in Franklinton along the banks of the Scioto River. The prison was 
      large enough that it held over 5,0 00 prisoners at one point. By the late 
      1970s newer and better equipped facilities were built and the Ohio Pen was 
      becoming obsolete. In 1984 the pen closed its doors sending most prisoners 
      to Mansfield's new prison. To many this was a major loss, but to those of 
      us who explore it was the greatest thing ever to happen to Columbus's 
      exploration scene. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4>As you'll notcie in the pictures provided, the prison was 
      torn down in 1998 to make room for the new Nationwide arena. I 
      unfortunately have no pictures of my journies inside the prison. On our 
      last attempt at going in, after the decision to tear it down, we were 
      faced with a security guard who was watching over the partially destroyed 
      prison. We chose not to go in, and returned the next day to snap these 
      photos. I'm very dissapointed that I never had the sense to take pictures, 
      but I'll always have memories of one of the greatest abandoned sites in 
      Columbus, and probable the World. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4>My first trip into the prison was spawned from a failed 
      attempt at going into an abandoned building near Front Street in Columbus, 
      Ohio. Unfortunately the only entrance ot the building on Front St. was a 
      second floor window. I was the first to step in, and the first to go 
      through the rotted floor. I didn't go completely thorugh, but my foot and 
      leg were enough to make me turn around. Upon my exit a discussion began as 
      to where to go. The minority of us decided on the Prison, but since 
      everyone actually wanted to go (they just didn't know it), we went.

    <TD><FONT size=4>The prison at this point was surrounded by a chainlink 
      fence due to the removal of the wall about 2 years prior. There was a gate 
      near the rear of the complex that was large enought to easily fit through. 
      The layout of the complex required us to run, as low as possible, through 
      the entire courtyard. We arrived at the first of many different buildings. 
      (only the main cellblock is pictured here). All of the buildings were very 
      open and easy to get into. We were welcomed by a loud banging noise 
      echoing through the warehouse sized building. It ended up being the wind.

    <TD><FONT size=4>The complex was large, and our "tour" took most of the 
      night from about 2:00am until about 6:00am (it was getting light). We 
      didn't hit all of the buildings that night, but what I saw made me know 
      I'd return. We made it a point to climb into the courtyard observation 
      tower, and my companions climbed the water tower, a feat I'd accomplish on 
      my second trip. By far, the most shocking part of the trip is the 
      cellblock. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4>Our trip took us through many buildings including a 
      cafeteria, workshop, church, and hospital. The cell block had the biggest 
      impact on me. From floor to ceiling to floor were bars. The cells were 
      separed from the outside walls as a separate complex within a bulding. 
      (imagine a cheap 2 story style hotel with outside hallways inside an 
      airplane hangar). The cells were very small and faced awayfrom each other 
      separed by bricks. Thats isolation! The paint was peeling to a point of 
      not being able to rea most of the numbers above the cells. </FONT></TD>

    <TD><FONT size=4>We toured the rest of the main cellblock building and 
      found many other interesting things such as what appeared to be the 
      visitation area with strange paintings on the walls, and the old windowed 
      telephone booths. This led us to believe the other cellblock would have 
      been the cellblock in major use because the telephones were between the 
      visitation area and the newer cellblock. We weren't able to get upstairs 
      into what I later found out was an indoor gym/courtyard sort of thing due 
      to a burnt stairwell and poor flashlights. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4>That same night we visited the church which was a very 
      peaceful and serine area to sit an think. We made it into the cafeteria 
      where the tables and benches still sat. We looked into some tunnles (my 
      friend would later use these to escape from the cops on a trip I passed 
      up). We saw an upstairs machine shop that still held drill presses, and we 
      even journied into the cellblock basement in search of the infamous 
      electric chair. It was gone. </FONT></TD>

    <TD><FONT size=4>My second and final trip brought us into more buildings, 
      and roofs. We found an elevator room that made us question if we were the 
      first there since 1984. We found elevator shafts with the elevators stuck 
      in between. We found what some say is solitary and others say is Death Row 
      (I'll look into this). I finally climbed the watertower an touched the 
      ball at the top. We found strange patios, tunnles, and offices. The second 
      trip was by far the most fun. My friend claimed himself an ashtray that 
      looked very similar in spirit to the watertower. He still had it when I 
      saw him 3 years ago. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4>The prison is one of those places that can't be 
      recreated. There are places that are scarry, places that are interestin, 
      probably even other prisons, but ours was had its own attiude and emotion 
      that can't be beat. My friends were later arrested there for repelling 
      from the water tower. This is when one of them escaped through the 
      tunnles. I was never afraid of being caught. It would be worth it. It 
      taught me much about what will go into this page and much about my 
      feelings on abandoned buildings. Never pass up a chance... </FONT></TD>
