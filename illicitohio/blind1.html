  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">The School for the Blind 
    was an early exploration for us. We had been talking about checking it out 
    for quite some time, but we simply hadn't had the time. Finally we pulled 
    together a group of people to go visit. I managed to show up late and miss 
    the group, but a giant cardboard sign on the door of the bar we were meeting 
    at let me know the crew had left without me. I believe it said &quot;We already 
    left for the blind school&quot; or something very subtle like that.</font></p>
  <table width="93%" border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td width="52%" height="384"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I managed 
          to catch up the group just as they were entering the building. Perfect 
          timing. The building was basically wide open. We didn't have to do anything 
          more than duck under something to enter. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The location of the building made 
          us very visable to people passing by and the large number of unboarded 
          windows made us that much more obvious. We all had flashlights as well 
          as cameras with flashes, so the fact that we didn't get caught is a 
          miracle. Once we had split up, I could find the others at almost anytime 
          just by looking for light in the windows of the wings they were in.

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Anytime I watch a horror movie I question 
    why they ever split up, yet it seems that every time we go to one of these 
    buildings with a large group of people, we split up. So far, none of us have 
    been killed by any monsters.</font></p>

      <td width="41%"><div align="justify"> 
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The night was one of the hottest 
            of the summer. We roasted in these upper floors. Keep in mind that 
            the humidity levels in these places are usually astronomical due to 
            being closed up and leaky. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">As usual on some of these older 
            explorations, my camera died on me, so some of these pictures are 
            actually from a follow up trip that Andy and I took. The building 
            was so incredibly dark on the first walk through that the pictures 
            I did take before the camera dying didn't come out well anyhow. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">The building was unusal 
    in that the upper floors hadn't been touched in years. The lower floors all 
    had been renovated and used by Ohio's finest State Troopers (the ones that 
    constantly make my drive to work slow and difficult. The Gym on the back of 
    the building was almost like a separate building. The entire layout was a 
    little strange). </font></p>

    <tr> 
      <td width="43%" height="384"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The very 
          top floors were my favorite part. There was writing all over the walls, 
          some of which was probably fake, but some of which looked real to me. 
          The dates ranged from the 1890s to 2000. On this trip, I learned that 
          kids have always been a little bit on the vulger side. Don't let <font color="#FFFFFF"><em>Leave 
          it to Beaver</em></font> fool you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">It saddens me to say that most of 
          these messages were likely damaged during a fire that occured during 
          the construction to renovate the building. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Strangely I witnessed the fire. I was driving 
    home from a fine meal at Long John Silvers on Parsons and happened to look 
    up and notice the fire peaking from above the trees. As I got closer I could 
    see firetrucks and people watching. I couldn't believe it was burning. All 
    of that cool stuff in the upper floors was likely being ruined as I stood 
    there in shock. I had been in the building probably around a month or so prior 
    if I remember correctly. </font></p>

            if they renovated the upper floors or if they simply reused the lower 
            floors that the staties had previously used. Hopefully I can go back 
            some day to check it out legitimately. </font></p>

    to some of the small upper rooms. There were large metal structures in some 
    of the rooms that we couldn't identify. There was pretty much eye candy everywhere.</font></p>
