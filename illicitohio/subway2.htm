    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This is the portal for the 2nd tunnel. 
      This one was much easier to get in to than the short tunnel. We simply 
      climbed up the gate and back down the other side. There were some 
      construction workers near by that we had to watch out for, but we were 
      otherwise out of view. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This sign is right inside the first 
      tunnel. It is a warning of the high pressure in the water pipe housed 
      inside the tunnel on the other side. The water pipe was put in the tunnel 
      long after the subway project was abandoned. It's said that these tunnels 
      saved the city hundreds of thousands in construction on the pipeline.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>I'm not sure what this lift looking 
      device was for. It's possible that it was for laying the pipes in to 
      place, but I doubt it. This was in the tunnel that housed the pipe. Most 
      of our journey was taken in the other tunnel that runs next to it. Windows 
      connect them throughout nearly the entire trip (One station is the only 
      exception). </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This view was taken shortly after 
      entering the tunnel. It's a view of the gate that we came through. Most of 
      the pictures here are dark like this one. Hopefully this picture will help 
      give a scope as to the size of the tunnels.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Here is where the pipe comes up in to 
      the tunnel. The pipe was laid in the late 1950s. The pipe is covered by 
      thick plastic to keep the dripping water from eating away at the pipe's 
      surface I'm assuming. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This is another picture of the pipe 
      farther down. You can see light from one of the vents farther down. There 
      were vents throughout much of the system, however some were constructed as 
      to not let light in easily. There are other sections with no vents, and no 
      light at all. </FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This is a look down the tunnel that I 
      think would run South (without the pipe). You can see the wooden 
      elevations in the floor that the track would have laid on. These were 
      removed in some spots. In other spots you could see how the track would be 
      banked for the turns. <A 
      href="http://www.geocities.com/illicitohio/cinci/sub019.jpg">HERE</A> is 
      one example. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This is one of many old fuse panels 
      and switch boxes throughout the tunnels. Most of them were broken like 
      this one. <A

      another. There were also new switch boxes for the fiberoptic lines running 
      through the tunnel. The tubes for these lines can be seen in the above 
      picture. </FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR><A
