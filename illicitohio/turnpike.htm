  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">My parents had been telling 
    me about this old abandoned hotel along the turnpike for quite some time. 
    For some reason I had confused it for a hotel up near Cleveland next to the 
    turnpike, so I'd never put the effort forth to go check it out. One day I 
    happened to be back in the Youngstown area driving down the turnpike and I 
    happened to see the hotel... that was not near Cleveland. I decided to go 
    check it out.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So 
            I'm back in the Youngstown area for my good friend's wedding. The 
            last thing I wanted to do was climb around some abandoned building 
            and end up hurting myself the day before I was in his wedding, but 
            the oppritunity left me no choice. I ventured up near Austintown and 
            found the old hotel to be sitting right off the main road. The enrance 
            was a bit unusual because the hotel sits about 15 ft higher than the 
            road.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The road near the hotel 
    has a great parking spot for Semi trucks, so it wasn't hard to find a place 
    to park. I then followed the driveway up in to the hotel parking lot. The 
    area is pretty well secluded once you're up there. It was pretty obvious from 
    the condition that I wasn't the first person to visit this one.</font></p>

      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> At 
          first glance the building appeared to be pretty well secured. I initially 
          wasn't sure I'd be able to get in. A short walk along the rooms facing 
          the parking lot revealed all the doors to be locked and most of the 
          windows to be boarded. It didn't take long to find one window that wasn't 
          boarded over. Someone had broken that window which allowed anyone to 
          reach inside and open the door from the inside rather easily. Further 
          travels revealed that the other side of the building is wide open making 
          the reach through the window thing completely pointless.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I'm not sure why, but this building creeped 
    me out a little. It was really poorly lit by outside light in many spots because 
    of it being a hotel (thick drapes, etc). I felt like I was in the Shining. 
    I guess something about being in a big empty hotel, in the middle of nowhere, 
    in the dark, alone, with no background noise other than traffic passing on 
    the highway, really freaks me out. Actually, the thought that I may not be 
    alone is what freaks me out. </font></p>

            anyone in the hotel, but it was obvious that many others had been 
            there. Many of the windows were broken. There were chairs tossed about 
            the lounge area. Some of the rooms had been vandelized, and there 
            was spray paint on just about anything with a flat surface. I certainly 
            wouldn't put this building at the top of the poor condition list, 
            but it wasn't great either. It pretty much looked like a place that 
            had been abandoned for about 8 years.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I haven't had the time to reaseach how 
    long it has actually been abandoned, but I know its been at least a couple 
    of years. It appears it had been temporarily used as an auction house toward 
    the end. There was also a restaurant on site that had possibly been open after 
    the hotel was not.</font></p>

          you've read this site before, I'm sure I've made mention of my fear 
          of empty swimming pools and pools of standing water. This place took 
          a pretty good stab at freaking me out with a swimming pool, boarded 
          over but collapsing, with about 2 ft of dark standing water. It was 
          so hot outside that it really didn't bother me as much as I thought 
          it would, but I still could have passed on seeing it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The weeds in this place had just 
          about taken over entirely. I had trouble getting around on the swimming 
          pool side of the building. There were also birds everwhere as there 
          always are in abandoned buildings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Toward the end of 
          my trip through the building I found myself in a very dark utitlity 
          area. For some reason I heard some noise that set my brain to panic 
          for a split second. Once your brain heads down that road it can be tough 
          to calm yourself down. You start noticing ever little sound, smell, 
          etc. I freaked a bit which is to say I wanted out of there right that 
          second.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Since I was in the middle 
    of this dark hallway, I couldn't really get a grasp on where to go next. I 
    wanted to find the room through which I had entered when you're in a dark 
    hallway with about 50 rooms, it can be tough to remember which one is &quot;yours&quot;. 
    I instead exited via a main entrance door to the pool side of the building. 
    That meant I had to walk through itchy weeds with sweaty legs to get back 
    to the side of the building on which I could exit the area. By the time it 
    was all said and done, I was spent. I left... and went to another abandoned 
    building actually. (See the youngstown Ohio section of this site for more 
    on that).</font></p>
