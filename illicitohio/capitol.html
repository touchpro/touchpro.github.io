            is one of the view buildings where we had to seriously push our policy 
            of not forcing our way in. We didn't force anything or break anything, 
            but we did open a window that wasn't open. For the most part, we just 
            walk right in to these places through open doors. This was an exception. 
            Had the building not been slated for demolishion, maybe we would have 
            reconsidered. Knowing that it was coming down anyhow, we decided to 
            take the risk and go for it. I'm glad we did, although I now have 
            very little to show for it. </font></p>

    bad shape. Many of the floors were rotted to the point of collapse. Some of 
    the ceilings were falling in. Other than the window we entered through, the 
    building was sealed off by way of the doors being welded shut. Freaky because 
    you knew you couldn't exit in a hurry. </font></p>

          or how it was put out. Since the building was welded shut, I can't imagine 
          the firemen had a way in, but maybe the welding came after the fire.</font></p>

            this building a real challenge is that the police refueling station 
            is directly behind it. That meant that everytime we heard a car coming, 
            we had to try to not look like to idiots with cameras trying to get 
            through a window to take pictures. I think we went unnoticed, but 
            it was still horrible for my nerves. Overall, Capitol was a mostly 
            a bust for me. The building was neat, but we didn't get to see half 
            of it, and my camera died. RIP: Marlboro Camera.**</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">*** The Marlboro Camera was the camera 
    I used to start the site. It was a camera that was found by someone I know 
    and given to me. It was a very cheap camera needless to say, but it was the 
    camera that made it through many of the explorations you'll read about on 
    this site. As mentioned before, I was able to use it after this exploration, 
    but it never worked correctly again. I have since traded it for a cheap Argus 
    2.0mpx digital camera that I love to death. I get easily attached to cameras 
    I guess.</font></p>
