  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Built in 1964, Northland mall was once 
    one of Columbus' series of directionally named malls. Eastland, Westland, 
    Southland mall are currently still operating. Northland closed due to lack 
    of attendance in 2003, likely due to the opening of Polaris fashion place 
    on Polaris road, and Easton Town Center just off of Morse road (about 5 min 
    from Northalnd). I had been planning to try to get a peek inside the mall 
    before it was demolished, but I never imagined I would have a chance to legally 
    and freely stroll through the closed mall. </font> </p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">I was driving by the 
            mall and noticed a large Liquidation Sale sign with several cars in 
            the parking lot. I stopped by assuming I'd get a quick peek at something 
            minor if I walked it. As it ended up, The entire mall, with the exception 
            of Sears and Lazurus, was opened. I didn't find a single area I couldn't 
            get in to if I so chose. Light was limited, and I didn't want to make 
            it obvious that I was there to snoop and not shop for old mall furniture, 
            so some of my pictures suffered for the cause.</font> </p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">By the time it was all said 
    and done, I ended up going in to the mall two additional times. Once to grab 
    more pictures while it was still 'open' for liquidation, and one other time 
    as it was being destroyed. That final trip was actually only in to the sears 
    store as everything else was already gone.</font></p>

          was a real bummer to see the mall go. I'd shopped in the sears store 
          many times and still to this day use tools that I purchased there. Even 
          at the time I was shopping at the store there were signs that the mall 
          had lost its luster. Many of the name brand stores had been replaced 
          with air-brushing business or no-name retailers that seemed to come 
          and go weekly. The mall concourse would be virtually empty during the 
          week and populated mostly with teens on the weekends. </font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">There were some very interesting things 
    to see in the mall during those final days. One of the more interesting was 
    the security setup in JC Penny. There were a series of 2 way mirrors around 
    the top of the store that could be accessed from the storage area that surrounded 
    the store. One the inside there were small booths set up where security could 
    sit and watch shoppers without the shoppers knowing. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Another unusual area 
            of the mall was a room, behind the recently updated food court, that 
            had gravel floors. It was basiaclly like a section of unused mall 
            that they decided to put a roof over I guess. Maybe this isn't as 
            unusual as I think, but basically you opened a door and you were in 
            a cement room with a gravel floor and nothing else. Maybe it was used 
            for something, but it didn't appear to be from what I could see. </font></p>

      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">On my initial trip 
          I was dissappointed by the inability to access Sears. I'd always wondered 
          what this one section of windows and doors along the top of the rear 
          of the store had been used for because you couldn't see them from inside 
          the store. I was later able to access the sears store and found that 
          they were offices and an employee lounge type of area. I still wonder 
          if they were originally intended for something else... something open 
          to the public perhaps. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">One of the stores I had attended 
          more regularly, although not by my own choice, was the Limited. Many 
          times I had looked up at the system of decorative catwalks and thought 
          about how one might get up there. That was one of the first places I 
          headed to on my trip through the mall. Of course it was unlocked, and 
          of course I walked across that catwalk. I had to walk through total 
          darkness to find it, but it was worth it. </font></p></td>

            final thing worth mentioning is the large picture to the right of 
            this text. Its hard to see, but this was a picture that someone had 
            hung up in the JC Penny's store. Its the mall around Christmas time 
            I believe of the year it opened. As you can see, its completely packed 
            with cars, much like nearby Polaris or Easton would be now. I guess 
            what I'm saying is that I'm really looking forward to sneaking around 
            Polaris one of these days.</font></p>
