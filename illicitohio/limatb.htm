            about my site somehow and mentioned the hospital. I didn't really 
            know the person and completely dismissed her claims of how large it 
            was. How could I not know about this place if it were so great. I 
            should have listened. The Lima TB hospital is absolutely as good as 
            she explained. The building is huge and the location is one of the 
            better in the state. The hospital is basically hidden in the woods 
            behind a neighborhood on Lima's west side.</font></p>

    few remaining TB hospitals in the state of Ohio. The lima hospital opened 
    in the early 1900s and was smaller than the version you see here. The building 
    pictured here consists of a newer middle section sandwitched between two wings 
    of the older building.</font></p>

          newer building was built in the very late 1950s which is why it sort 
          of has that cold war era look about it. If you're in to abandoned buildings 
          and have seen the pictures of Chernobyl, you'll see that this building 
          sort of looks like it could be sitting right in the middle of all of 
          those buildings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The entire premise 
          was pretty much let go in the 1970s and has been sitting since. The 
          building is in horrible condition. The older end buildings are barely 
          standing. One is nearly collapsed and the other is only slightly better. 
          The middle section was used for paintball and is pretty much beyond 
          saving. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">This building may be the most difficult 
    to find of all abandoned buildings. The building basically sits in a field 
    in the middle of the woods behind a residential area in Lima. You can be very 
    very close to the building without knowing that its there. I actually headed 
    to Lima assuming I could find it on my own without any direction at all. </font></p>

            glad I pushed the issue. The building is such a pain to locate that 
            she had to call her friend to get directions. As she was doing so, 
            andother man came in and overheard her. He knew what she was talking

          stand in a room in which you safely assume several people probably have

          a visit... sort of like going to a an old battlefield.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The middle sections

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The building was an unexpected 
    treat. I did start to get a little freaked out by being out in the middle 
    of nowhere for too long. At one point I could hear something making noise 
    outside of a basement window. The windows were covered in screen but had no 
    glass. I walked over and there was a <a href="limatb/DCAO0056.jpg" target="_blank">groundhog</a> 
    just chilling out doing <a href="limatb/DCAO0056.jpg" target="_blank">groundhog</a> 
    stuff. He had no idea I was inches away from him on the other side of this 
    steel mesh. He eventually figured it out and nearly crapped himself.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Apparently the ground hog 
    had the telephone number of another woodland creature. Upon leaving the complex, 
    I saw a tractor trailor backed in to the woods. I figured I'd check it out 
    as well. I walked toward the door, and as I did I heard a sound that sounded 
    like someone slamming the door of the truck as loud as they could right in 
    front of me. It was a <a href="limatb/Dcao0073_2.jpg" target="_blank">deer</a> 
    that was sleeping under the truck. He was probably less than 10 ft away and 
    he literally scared me badly enough that I could barely walk for about 2 mintues. 
    I don't think I've been that scared in years. I thought I was about to get 
    murdered by a semi truck trailor. Back to the building... </font></p>
