            this is a train garage from the Youngstown and Southern rail company. 
            There are about 5 buildings on site ... a garage, a small office, 
            another small office, a storage building, and a coal building.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The 
            rail line hasn't been used regularly for a really long time. I used 
            to play on one of the small train bridges neary by. In my teens it 
            was used as a recreational rail ride type of thing, but that didn't 
            last long in Negley. </font></p>

    tree farm on the bend heading out of Negley on rt 170 used the rail line for 
    hauling construction trash from outside of the area for the purpose of dumping. 
    The residents of Negley are thrilled I'm sure. This accounts for the two diesel 
    engines outside of the garage.</font></p>

          as well as old bus parts in the near by storage building. I don't think 
          I've ever seen as much bird crap in any one place as what I saw splashed 
          on those bus parts. Other than that, no signs of regular use for much 
          of anything. Both of the grease pits in the garage were full of water.</font></p></td>

          near could fit my house and my entire piece of property here in the 
          City inside of this place. The picutres really don't do it justice.

            There were even vents in the ceiling above where the train's smoke

            the garage. Everything inside the place was really heavy duty. When
