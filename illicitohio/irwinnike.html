  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Finally, the last stop on 
    my four site tour of the Pittsburgh Area Nike sites. If you've read none of 
    the others, to recap, I started with Coraopolis which had been imploded, then 
    went to Elrama, which was neat, but I didn't get under ground. Next I went 
    to Herminie where I was shown around by the owner a little, but didn't get 
    pictures, and lastly, I end up here... the launch site of Irwin. I could tell 
    from the gate that this place was pretty wide open. I couldn't get in the 
    main gate because it was closed, so I went for a little hike around the poperty.

            case you all forget the sacrafices that I make to bring you these 
            pictures, let me just say that I was torn to hell and back by jagger 
            bushes on this one. They were everywhere. I literally crawled on my 
            stomach through a small ditch, under bushes, etc. I felt my skin being 
            snagged by these stupid bushes which were obviously created by either 
            years of mean evolution, or a God that doesn't like trespassers. After 
            what felt like an eternity, I found a tree that had fallen through 
            the fence. It wasn't quite an invite, but I took it as a sign. I went 
            in. I first made my way to the launch, and much to my surprise, the 
            bays were wide open... as in the doors were open as pictured to the 
            right. This was as close to an invitation as I was going to get. I 
            was equally shocked to make my way down the steps to find a dry room.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">This is where I fail to 
    impress. It was dark, and this was about a month before I bought my tripod. 
    I couldn't get good pictures. I took some, but it was freaky as hell. I kept 
    thinking I'd hear the doors slamming shut and then realize that my cell didn't 
    work under ground. I'm such a wimp. I snapped as many pictures as my crappy 
    flash would let me snap. I may go back sometime for a few more pictures with 
    the tripod. There wasn't much down there, but what was there, I got pictures 
    of. It was in shockingly good shape. From what I could tell it had never been 
    wet. The sump pump wasn't running and there appeared to be no power to run 
    it. A trip over to the other battery would show about 1 inch of water on the 
    floor. </font></p>

          I am... the place I'd been dying to see... an underground missile storage. 
          It was as neat as a cement room under the ground can be, but my paranoia 
          got the better of me, and I bolted after a few minutes. I checked out 
          the rest of the location. Everything was wide open. I was parked in 
          a super obvious spot, so I kept thinking that my time was marked, but 
          no one ever showed up. Maybe no one cares? There was a relatively new 
          looking pit dug. Chip from the previous site had mentioned the superfund 
          people had been around lately, so maybe they had put the drainage in 
          or removed an underground fuel tank? Anyway, other than that and some 
          half mowed grass, the site appeared to be abandoned. At one point I 
          thought I might have recognized some horse barrels, but I'm not sure.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">In addition to the battery, I made it through 
    the bunker, which was near the barraks. The roof is thick cement. I felt safe. 
    I went through the assembly, where not much was left, as well as through the 
    barraks... in bad condition, and a garage that was also in bad condition. 
    The basketball hoop was still there surprisingly. </font></p>

            point. I left here without much time remaining before I needed to 
            be on the road home. I made a very quick stop by the control site, 
            which was actually a little ways away compared to the others. The
