    resort owned by Jim and Tammy Bakker near Fort Mill South Carolina. The resort 
    was one of the most visitied attractions in the U.S while it was open. Jim

            park is now being rebuilt and reopened. More info can be found at 
            the end of this page. Currently the park is under construction. I

          park until recently when a developer and another ministry decided to 
          purchase and develop the land. Most of these pictures were taken right

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I made several trips to the grounds between 
    2004 and mid 2005. My first trip was on a whim while in town for a Nascar 
    race. We made a brief trip around the grounds and climbed around the waterpark 
    a bit. The second trip was in early 2005 and involved getting some pictures 
    of some of the more remote buildings. My final trip was for the sole purpose 
    of getting some pictures of the Tower which I was able to do.</font></p>

            probably one of the more interesting features. I actually ran out 
            of battery during my best trip in to the water park, so the pictures 
            are limited, but the park was really cool. It was a great example 
            of the quality of Heritage USA. The park was all integrated in to 
            a large fake mountain. The train that took people around the park 
            passed through the mountain and under a waterfall coming off the mountain. 
            There was a snack bar inside a cave of the mountain. Everything was 
            themed and connected with other attractions.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">One of the biggest goals for me personally 
    was to get in to the tower. I did not succeed on my first two trips due to 
    varying circumstances. I was determined to see the inside of that building 
    before they imploded it (they later decided not to implode it and it is standing 
    empty as of the writing). I headed down to Heritage and stayed locally so 
    I could check the tower out at any time I felt it was possible.</font></p>

      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> The 
          first night I was there I made a trip through the former church barn. 
          I found the old location of a store that had a bunch of heritage related 
          souvineer items wasting away. From that location I could see the tower 
          in the distance. I couldn't resist. At about 11pm I headed up that way 
          and scoped the area out. There was only one person around. I figured 
          there was no better time than now so I worked my way behind the first 
          fence surrounding the tower. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I should explain that 
          there were two fences around the tower. Normally I don't force my way 
          in to anything, but I did make an exception this one time. I hopped 
          a section of the second fence that was had been pushed down a little 
          by someone else and I was at the base of the tower looking up. I quickly 
          realized that I had no way to actually get in the tower. I'd have to 
          do a little more forcing. I found a loose board and pushed a little... 
          BOOM!... a large pallot inside the tower fell over against the cement 
          floor and echod like crazy through the still quite night. I went in.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Upon entering I quickly 
    realized that my cheap flashlight was no match for the darkness inside the 
    tower. I couldn't see anything other than some orange light seeping around 
    the boarded windows. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I really didn't get much 
    of a look at the lobby. I headed up stairs to see what I could find in case 
    someone heard the noise and came looking. No one did. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Aside from being a little 
    freaked out by being in there alone, the tower was amazing. The lower floors 
    were nearly finished, but as I went upward they became less and less finished 
    until I got to a point where there was nothing more than bathtubs and unfinished 
    walls. The roof was probably one of the best parts. There was a giant peace 
    on earth light up there that I nearly caught my neck on. There were bats everywhere 
    up there trying to figure out who was in there territory. Actually there were 
    plenty of bats in the lower floors as well. </font></p>

            up on the roof alone with the summer air blowing around was really 
            cool. I could see the city way off in the distance and I could see 
            pretty much all of heritage. I can't really explain the feeling, but 
            my senses had been really heightend by being in the building alone 
            on the way up, so once I was at the top it was just total relaxation. 
            I chilled out up there for quite a while just taking everything in 
            and thinking about how the hell I ended up on top of an old building 
            in the middle of nowhere alone at midnight.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Speaking of bats... they're 
    insane. At one point I was walking down steps with my flashlight pointed straight 
    at my feet to make sure I didn't step on anything too loud. I had my fingers 
    over the light so just a little bit of light would get through. One of the 
    bats kept passing under the light, which means it was about 6 inches from 
    my legs and I couldn't get rid of him. In the lobby he continued to bother 
    me and kept chirping. I finally tried to get away by running to the other 
    side of the lobby and the little bastard still found me. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Getting out was no easy 
    task. The board I had pushed to get in was difficult to get through now that 
    I was going the other way. I did eventually get out just in time to hear a 
    car coming. Keep in mind that this is an area you can't get in to from the 
    street. I could see headlights coming and I was still inside of two layers 
    of fence. I layed in the grass. I could see a spotlight going across the top 
    of the building next to me. I waited and eventually heard the vehicle pull 
    to the other side of the tower behind me. There was a little more spotlight 
    action. I heard them pull away and figured I'd better move on. I hopped the 
    first fence and managed to catch my armpit on the fence post or something. 
    Nothing says comfort like a mixture of blood and armpit sweat. I made my way 
    back to where I was staying and slept it off. Sorry Security person. No harm 
    no fowl?</font></p>

    quite a bit. The grounds were really saturated with places to sleep and entertain. 
    The barn and studio were really cool as well. It was amazing the amount of 
    damage that the barn had suffered. I've read that some of that damage was 
    due to the big hurricane in the 1990s. The amount of stuff that really was 
    left untouched at heritage is unmatched. I have way more heritage content 
    on my other side at <a href="http://sbno.illiciohio.com">http://sbno.illiciohio.com</a>.
