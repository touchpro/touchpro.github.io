    Pen was one of the first places added to the site. I visited the pen on a 
    few occasions over during the years leading up when it was demolished to allow 
    room for the Nationwide Arena. Today there is very little to even remind us 
    of where the prison once stood. The area has been rebuilt and the landscape 
    has changed. Here is what I wrote about the prison upon building the site 
    in the 1990's...</font></p>

      <td width="47%" height="228"> <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The 
          prison was built in Columbus, Ohio in 1834. It was the second Ohio Penitentiary 
          in Columbus, with the first being in Scioto Street in Franklinton along 
          the banks of the Scioto River. The prison was large enough that it held 
          over 5,000 prisoners at one point. By the late 1970s newer and better 
          equipped facilities were built and the Ohio Pen was becoming obsolete. 
          In 1984 the pen closed its doors sending most prisoners to Mansfield's 
          new prison. To many this was a major loss, but to those of us who explore 
          it was the greatest thing ever to happen to Columbus's exploration scene.</font><font size="4" face="Courier New">

          no pictures of my journies inside the prison. On our last attempt at 
          going in, after the decision to tear it down, we were faced with a security 
          guard who was watching over the partially destroyed prison. We chose 
          not to go in, and returned the next day to snap these photos. I'm very 
          dissapointed that I never had the sense to take pictures on the inside, 
          but I'll always have memories of one of the greatest abandoned sites 
          in Columbus, and possibly the World.</font></div></td>

      <td width="52%" height="384"><font size="4" face="Courier New">My first 
        trip into the prison was spawned from a failed attempt at going into an 
        abandoned building near Front Street in Columbus, Ohio. Unfortunately 
        the only entrance ot the building on Front St. was a second floor window. 
        I was the first to step in, and the first to go through the rotted floor. 
        I didn't go completely thorugh, but my foot and leg were enough to make 
        me turn around. Upon my exit a discussion began as to where to go. The 
        minority of us decided on the Prison, but since everyone actually wanted 
        to go (they just didn't know it), we went.</font></td>

  <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The prison at this point 
    was surrounded by a chainlink fence due to the removal of the wall about 2 
    years prior. There was a gate near the rear of the complex that was large 
    enought to easily fit through. The layout of the complex required us to run, 
    as low as possible, through the entire courtyard. We arrived at the first 
    of many different buildings. (only the main cellblock is pictured here). All 
    of the buildings were very open and easy to get into. We were welcomed by 
    a loud banging noise echoing through the warehouse sized building. It ended 
    up being the wind.</font></p>

      <td width="49%"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The complex was large, 
        and our &quot;tour&quot; took most of the night from about 2:00am until 
        about 6:00am (it was getting light). We didn't hit all of the buildings 
        that night, but what I saw made me know I'd return. We made it a point 
        to climb into the courtyard observation tower, and my companions climbed 
        the water tower, a feat I'd accomplish on my second trip. By far, the 
        most shocking part of the trip is the cellblock.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Our trip took us through 
    many buildings including a cafeteria, workshop, church, and hospital. The 
    cell block had the biggest impact on me. From floor to ceiling to floor were 
    bars. The cells were separed from the outside walls as a separate complex 
    within a bulding. (imagine a cheap 2 story style hotel with outside hallways 
    inside an airplane hangar). The cells were very small and faced awayfrom each 
    other separed by bricks. Thats isolation! The paint was peeling to a point 
    of not being able to rea most of the numbers above the cells.</font></p>
  <table width="93%" border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td width="52%" height="384"><font size="4" face="Courier New">We toured 
        the rest of the main cellblock building and found many other interesting 
        things such as what appeared to be the visitation area with strange paintings 
        on the walls, and the old windowed telephone booths. This led us to believe 
        the other cellblock would have been the cellblock in major use because 
        the telephones were between the visitation area and the newer cellblock. 
        We weren't able to get upstairs into what I later found out was an indoor 
        gym/courtyard sort of thing due to a burnt stairwell and poor flashlights.</font></td>

  </table>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Courier New">That same night we visited 
    the church which was a very peaceful and serine area to sit an think. We made 
    it into the cafeteria where the tables and benches still sat. We looked into 
    some tunnles (my friend would later use these to escape from the cops on a 
    trip I passed up). We saw an upstairs machine shop that still held drill presses, 
    and we even journied into the cellblock basement in search of the infamous 
    electric chair. It was gone.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Courier New">My second and final trip 
    brought us into more buildings, and roofs. We found an elevator room that 
    made us question if we were the first there since 1984. We found elevator 
    shafts with the elevators stuck in between. We found what some say is solitary 
    and others say is Death Row (I'll look into this). I finally climbed the watertower 
    an touched the ball at the top. We found strange patios, tunnles, and offices. 
    The second trip was by far the most fun. My friend claimed himself an ashtray 
    that looked very similar in spirit to the watertower. He still had it when 
    I saw him 3 years ago.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The prison is one of those 
    places that can't be recreated. There are places that are scarry, places that 
    are interestin, probably even other prisons, but ours was had its own attiude 
    and emotion that can't be beat. My friends were later arrested there for repelling 
    from the water tower. This is when one of them escaped through the tunnles. 
    I was never afraid of being caught. It would be worth it. It taught me much 
    about what will go into this page and much about my feelings on abandoned 
    buildings. Never pass up a chance...</font></p>
