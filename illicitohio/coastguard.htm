    and snow. </font></p>

            forward a year and a few months and here we are. I found myself in 
            Cleveland with an entire day off of work ahead of me. I headed down 
            town, and after getting lost several times, I found my way down toward 
            the Whiskey Island Coast Guard Station. I say I found my way toward 
            it because even once I had found the place, I still couldn't <strong>find</strong> 
            the place. The plus side to this was that I found a nice <a href="clevelandhotel.htm" target="_blank">abandoned 
            hotel</a> up the road a ways.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">As it ends up, the Station 
    sits off the end of an inlet near the flats. I parked at Wendy Park and ventured 
    out toward the station not knowing if I'd be able to get to it or not. It 
    ended up being really easy once I found the little pier/walkway. There was 
    one sign that I had to ignore and a fence I had to bypass a little, but with 
    relative ease I found myself headed out to the station. </font></p>

      <td width="49%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The station was built 
          in the 40's with an art deco theme and was used as a Coast Guard station 
          up until the 1970's when it was closed. The land was later sold to a 
          development company that made it in to an eatery and night club. That 
          didn't last too long at all due to the difficulty of getting out to 
          the club (there is no drivable road). The club closed and the building 
          has been vacant ever since. I did find some menus and recipts in the 
          base of the lighthouse section for a place called the Island at the 
          coast guard station. </font></p></td>

  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The building is in horrible condition. 
    I can't express how poor the condtion was, but I can tell you that this was 
    the most worried for my safety I've ever been in terms of building collapse. 
    There was one time that a section of roof gave way slightly, and another time 
    that the wall I tried to support myself with began to fall over... it was 
    supporting other stuff. It was absolutely unfit for visiting in most sections. 
    I sucked it up, and I did it all for you.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New"> For 
            quite some time it seemed that the lighthouse section would be off 
            limits. It appeared to have been blocked off by the renovations for 
            the club. This was not the case. Before long I found the right section 
            of the building and I headed on up. This part of the building was 
            more stable, but still in poor condition. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">The 
            view from many parts of the building is amazing. How the park hasn't 
            fixed this up for tours and such is beyond me. It has to be one of 
            the best views of the city. The photos don't do it justice at all.

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">I 
            clearly wasn't the fist person to visit the building, but there were

    lot more to stay. I'd keep far away from this one if you care at all for the 
    current shape of your head. I've expressed danger with other buildings, but 
    this one is unreal. The base of the tower was infested with flies... thousands. 
    They were all over me, but again... I do it all for you, the reader. </font></p>
