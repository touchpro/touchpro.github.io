          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The 
            Negly Ohio train tressel was something I had visited as a child with 
            a friend of mine and his father. He took us out too see an old train 
            tressel that my friend's grandfather had worked on. It was about a 
            mile or more hike back through the woods, and involved walking the 
            trail on the old rail line that had been cut through the trees. The 
            rail hadn't been used for quite some time and if I recall correctly, 
            the tressel showed it.</font></p>

      <td width="52%"><p align="center"><a href="tressel/DCAO0047.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tressel/DCAO0047.jpg" width="340" border="0"></a></p>
        
      <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">This 
        is where the tressel would have been... you can still see the footers.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The tressel was actually 
    pretty high. When you were in the middle, you were pretty much looking down 
    on the tops of the trees that were in the center of the valley. The tressel 
    passed over a small creek that fed the little beaver creek near Middletown 
    Ohio. When I had visited as a kid you could easily just park near the tracks 
    and walk in to the woods. More recently the land had been purchased by a rich 
    guy and he has since blocked off any potential parking. The near by town literally 
    has a no parking sign anywhere that you could potentially park... I'm not 
    exagerating at all. I would honestly guess it to have the highest resident 
    to 'no parking' sign ratio of any place on earth, and I would guess its more 
    than one per resident.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">More

      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> So 
          back to my trips. I had ventured back out here at some point as a teenager 
          in highschool. I have no idea why I would have done this, but I actually 
          walked across the tattered remains of the tressel in the dark with nothing 
          more than a mag light. Guys will do stupid stuff in groups. There was 
          a section in the center where someone had burnt the ties out of the 
          bridge, so you had to crawl across the gap by putting your feet on each 
          rail and hands on each rail. I held the mag light in my stupid mouth. 
          Very dumb, but somewhat memorable.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">This final trip really didn't pan out. 
    We were able to park because the road nearby had washed out and the people 
    from noparkingville were on the other side of the wash out from where we parked. 
    The would had have to have driven a tow truck way out around to get us. Who's 
    laughing now middletown?!?!? Well, probably still them because little did 
    I know someone had town the tressel down at some point. Two miles of walking 
    later I found out. </font></p>

      <td width="48%" height="302"><div align="center"> 
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">So with the tressel 
            gone, we turned around and headed back. The cool thing about this 
            final trip is that it was with my father and it was shortly after 
            we had found out he had prostate cancer which of course shook us up 
            quite a bit. My dad will be just fine and I knew he'd be fine, but 
            it still really changes things when you're faced with that. So this 
            trip ended up being a good chance for us to hang out with no distractions.</font></p>

      <td width="52%"><p align="center"><a href="tressel/DCAO0066.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tressel/DCAO0066.jpg" width="340" border="0"></a></p>

        over ties.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">We ended up taking a short cut out of the 
    woods by walking up the heavily wooded hill next to the rail line and meeting 
    up with the road that was cut in to the hill above us. I'm so out of shape 
    that I was sore the next day, yet my dad, some 32 years older than me, was 
    fine. I need to shape up. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Well the tressel was gone. I'm curious 
    as to how they were able to remove the remains because there really is no 
    easy way in and out of here. This place is secluded. They also pulled out 
    all of the rail leading back to it. Some of that rail was burried by large 
    rocks, so they really must have wanted it out. The only signs of the rail 
    line is the path, a small number of ties, the cement butts, and the cement 
    footers from the tressel supports. The pictures don't do the height of this 
    thing justice. It was pretty tall.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So that was the trip. The coolest thing 
    was that we spent some time together doing something completely pointless. 
    Normally I leave the personal crap off this site, but I'm finding that I enjoy 
    going back and looking at the old stuff that I partially forgot about... so 
    if you don't like it... tough. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">If you're one of those rail buffs that 
    knows about rail lines, please let me know anything you think is important 
    here and I'll add it. I'd also love to know what is beyond the tressel as 
    I've never personally made the trek but have heard there is a tunnel.</font></p>
