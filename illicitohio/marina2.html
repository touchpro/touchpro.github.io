So as it ends up, I went back to the stadium the day before I left. My girlfriend was thrilled to death that she got to sit in a rental car on our last day of vacation while I walked around a rotting stadium that I had previsouly been chased out of by a park ranger. <br>
<br>
I ventured back in and took the pictures that are posted below. There were quite a few rooms that I didn't get pictures of due to time constraints... more on that in a minute. I entered the building and had to swing around a fenced gate to get to the front section. There were places I could have just walked straigt in to, but I didn't realize this at the time. 
<br>
<br>
I made it to the front section and strolled around. I resisted the urge to enter the old sound/projection/whatever booth hanging in the center. It looked rusted. My fear of water kept me from jumping the small gap over to the barge. I made it to the top of the seating and looked around. Wasps started to bother me, so I snapped some pictures and got the hell out of there. Bees/Wasps/etc are the other major fear of mine, so I wasn't going to stick around and get stung. 
<br>
<br>
Once I snapped most of the pictures below, I was ready to head to the various rooms and whatnot that are housed under the seating. Right as I snapped my last picture of the barge, I turned around only to find my old friend the park ranger stanging a few rows up, facing toward the back of the stadium, I assume looking for me. How this guy didn't see me, I have no clue. I must have blended in with the cement due to my pale skin with random red burns (like the grafitti)....
<br>
<br>
So anyway, I ducked down and quickly made my way to the exit hall right behind this guys back. Once out of sight, I hauled my ass out of there and didn't get any more pictures. I assumed he was on my tail. Once in the rental car, I saw him come out of the building and start looking my way. Thank goodness I was in a rental. I swung the car around narrowly missing various fences and floored it out of there. That was the last I saw of the Marina Stadium...
<br>

Here are the pictures...

As you can see, the place is colorful. There were some newer looking boats docked there. <br><br>
I did a little research on this place. It ends up that it was originally used for concerts, boat races, fireworks, and ski shows. In 1992 the large hurricane Andrew unleashed on the place, and that was the end of the Stadium as Miami knew it. The building was opening in the early 60s (1963 I think). Another site I found detailed the cause of the closing as stress fractures in the roof. Apparently a giant heavy cement overhang with minimal support wasn't such a great idea. Who would have though?

Another thing I learned while researching is that you can no longer anchor in the bay area in front of the theater. That's a message for you boaters.
