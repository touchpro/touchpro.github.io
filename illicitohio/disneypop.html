  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">This is a strange one... 
    well first things first, this is my first update in a long time. I've been 
    sitting on these pictures for months, so I'll be working from memory here. 
    Let me start by setting the mood. About three days before leaving for my first 
    family vacation with my future step children, I managed to come down with 
    something that felt to be a cross between sars, ecoli, and death. I honestly 
    can't recall the last time I had felt so miserable. What happened was that 
    right as the weather was starting to get warmer, we had a sudden cold spell. 
    I'm not sure why, but this threw me in to a the worst sickness I could imagine. 
    I was basically sleeping around the clock, except when I'd wake up to throw 
    up, convulse, shiver, roll around in pain, etc. It was awful. </font></p>
  <table width="93%" border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td width="50%" height="308"><div align="left">
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So as luck would 
            have it, I wasn't better the day before we left, so I went to the 
            ER, hoping only that they could load me up with saline to rehydrate 
            me. They didn't. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The next morning 
            I'm being shuffled in to a car, having not eaten for days, still ill. 
            I was without fever by then, so I'm hoping I didn't make others ill. 
            I somehow managed to get on to a plane and made the absolute worst 
            trip of my life. It may have been amongst the worst two hours of my 
            entire life. It was awful beyond words... but I made it... and little 
            did I know that by the time I got to the hotel, things would quickly 
            perk up.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">We stayed at the Disney 
    Pop Century Resort, which is a themed Disney hotel that has buildings from 
    each century... 1950's, 1960's, etc, up to 1999. It didn't occur to me until 
    we got there that the Century starts at 1900 and the hotel starts at 1950. 
    Where were the first 50 years? Well sitting abandoned across the lake of course! 
    Hooray! Disney thinks of something for everyone... even me. </font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> I was 
          still so sick that I could barely keep my eyes open. I was sore, tired, 
          etc. I felt much better than before, but still awful. I decided to let 
          the kids, girlfriend, grandparents, etc, go to disney without me for 
          the evening. I slept.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The next morning I 
          awoke feeling... still awful. So I once again decided to sit the trip 
          to the park out. I instead went to the very nice lobby restaurant to 
          try to find something to eat. As it ends up, they have all sorts of 
          decent food, and you can pay with your room key. I loaded up on fruit, 
          smart water (I love this stuff), and anything else that might help me 
          feel better.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I'll never know if it was the fruit, water, 
    granola bars, etc that helped, but as the day progressed, I felt better and 
    better. I would walk around a little, rest, eat, walk, etc, and every time 
    I felt better and better. I started thinking that if I was walking anyhow, 
    and there was a big old abandoned resort within walking distance... why not 
    go for it... and that leads me to this page.</font></p>

      <td width="50%" height="308"><div align="left">
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I first apologize 
            for my half assed coverage. I was still feeling absolutely awful. 
            I did this for all the people that send me nice emails. I also didn't 
            want to get busted and miss any more of my vacation with the kids... 
            yeah, I'm getting old and lame, but that's life. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I made a quick slip 
            around the fence where it butts up to the lake between the two resorts. 
            The way it was to work was that 1950-1999 would be on one side of 
            the lake, connected by the 'century gap' bridge to the 1900's through 
            1940's on the other side. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">That brings us to why this place exists. 
    With the first half of the resort completed, September 11th 2001 came along 
    and changed travel and tourism for quite some time. Faced with big declines 
    in tourism, disney decided to halt construction on the second half of the 
    project for fear of not being able to fill the hotel. It really surprises 
    me that Disney would allow this to be seen so clearly from one of their hotels, 
    but here we are seven years later. All of this is the story that was relayed 
    to me by a couple that I meant on the century gap bridge... which is open, 
    but ends abruptly at the abandoned side of the resort. The entire thing is 
    strange. Word has it that they will eventually finish it, but with family 
    suits... which seems strange since the rooms are already built. </font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">As 
          you can see here, the numbers are styled to represent the century that 
          they are representing... if that makes any sense.</font></p></td>
      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> As 
          you can see, the main structure of the lobby building was completed, 
          including the year markers across the front. The side that is open is 
          very similar, but much more colorful. As you can see, the numbers match 
          the art type of that decade... art deco being my favorite. Each hotel 
          building has period decorations on it. For example, ours had stair cases 
          that looked like giant bowling pins with the stairs in them, etc. Its 
          actually really neat for the kids. This side didn't have its art yet, 
          but you can see where it would have been mounted at the ends of the 
          buildings. </font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So basically 
    that was it. I made a quick trip from one side to the other and then hopped 
    the fence on the Century Gap Bridge (its very low) and walked back to my resort. 
    I felt pretty tired by then, and I honestly kept thinking... I hope the people 
    that go to the site appreciate my poor ass nearly dying in the sun... send 
    thank you cards to my home address.</font></p>

            abandoned buildings, which were mostly still shells at this point, 
            it was neat seeing some of the activity that still goes on at the 
            site. Apparently Disney uses the area to test decals, pavement, store 
            props, etc. There were big lights in the parking lot for something, 
            not sure what, and some of the lot had recently been landscaped. I'd 
            love to know all the neat details of what is going on, but I really 
            have no clue. Anyway, enough of my life story... check the pictures.

          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Oh, and if you're 
            wondering, I made it in to Disney that evening feeling pretty decent, 
            and made it to the park the next day to enjoy my trip!</font></p>
