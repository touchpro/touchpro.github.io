    be modified and expanded. Basically I decided to start keeping track of the 
    various small and strange abandoned buildings and homes I stumble upon.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The house at the top of 
    this page is an old house outside of Dublin Ohio on Post Rd. The house has 
    since been fixed up, but for many years this house sat empty. The windows 
    had all been broken and there were signs significant neglect on the tree house, 
    garage, pool, landscaping, and barn. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">It was obvious that something 
    strange went down because there was a nice in ground pool, deck, hottub, large 
    barn, garage, etc, and the place was being remodeled with nice materials. 
    The inside was partially done with large holes busted through the plaster 
    from what I could see. There were odd colored light bulbs in the portch lights 
    and there were keep out signs all over the windows.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I visitied 
            the property one day with my father while we were riding bikes in 
            the area, but I didn't go in. I was glad that I didn't because later 
            that day there was a truck parked there that hadn't been there earlier. 
            Strange Indeed. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The house directly above 
    this text is a small house that I happened to see on a detour one day. I have 
    no interior pictures of that house. I believe it is somewhere off of route 
    71 on route 30 near the general area of mansfield, lexington, etc. I really 
    can't recall.</font></p>

          number of houses that people just walk away from never ceases to amaze 
          me. There are just a few here now, but you can just about find or two 
          on your average afternoon drive through the country. I'm not just talking 
          about houses that aren't in use, but houses that are standing wide open 
          that don't appear to have had occupants for years. </font></p></td>

  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The strangest thing that I see in abandoned 
    buildings and homes are the personal items that people leave. I can't imagine 
    why someone would leave anything personal unless they've either died, or been 
    forced to leave against their will (eviction, etc).</font></p>

    <tr> 
      <td width="48%" height="298"><div align="center"> 
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">One such example was 
            a house on Rt. 23 south of Columbus that Andy and I visited back in 
            the day. Each room had personal touches. One had love messages written 
            inside the closet (Friend 1 loves friend 2 type of stuff). The wall 
            of another bedroom had cut outs of sports figures taped to the wall. 
            The main rooms had magazines, papers, books, etc. I believe the waterbed 
            even still had water. I just can't imagine what circumstances would 
            prompt leaving a house that way. It can't be anything good... unless 
            they won the lotto maybe?</font></p>

          pictures were taped all over the walls of this bedroom. I can't understand 
          why some people just leave something like that. I would imagine this 
          one was an eviction.</font></p></td>
