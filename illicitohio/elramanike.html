  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Elrama was the second site 
    on my four site Pittsburgh area 'tour'. This one was a little better than 
    Coraopolis... for starters, it hadn't been imploded. That was a good sign. 
    Secondly, I was able to walk right in. There was nothing keeping me out with 
    the exception of some barbed wire around the third battery for some reason. 
    Going by the pavement around that battery, its possible that it was collapsing. 
    The pavement was dipped, and even cracked near the elevator. Other than that, 
    this place was wide open. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">If 
            you're not reading these in order, to fill you in quickly, the Nike 
            program was a missile defense program from the 1950s. The missiles 
            were stored underground in a battery, and then brought to the top 
            to be fired if the Russians ever came our way. The program was never 
            really used because the Russians wussed out... I made that up. Anyway, 
            if you want to know a little more, go back to the first location... 
            <a href="coraopolisnike.html">Coraopolis</a>. For the most part, all 
            you need to know is that there are two sites, a launch and a control. 
            The launch is where the missiles were stored, assembled, etc, and 
            the control is where the radar and control equipment was housed. They 
            were typically about a mile or so apart from one another... give or 
            take. Both were often in a high spot in the county. Many major Cities 
            had a Nike Program. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So this site was apparently 
    in use by the county or city department. I kept thinking someone would come 
    by to yell at me, but I walked around for about 35 minutes with no questions. 
    I didn't see another person the entire time and was even able to enter the 
    generator building and the launch pad area.</font></p>

          batteries were all locked up, so I didn't enter any of them. I assumed 
          they'd be full of water like they typically are, but a later review 
          of the picture I took through the space between the elevator and pavement 
          shows that the battery is actually pretty dry. It does appear that it 
          had some water at one point. I wish now I'd have tried all the stair 
          ways to make sure that none were unlocked. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The generator house 
          is the only building I actually entered. The power was rumored to be 
          something unusual so that people couldn't us jamming deviced. I don't 
          know if that's true, but the power on the control panels indicated 240v 
          and 60amp (i think)?</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The generators were all gone, but you can 
    see in the above picture that they sat on cement pads and that there were 
    wiring troughs in the floor. I believe these were just used for emergency/back 
    up. The coolest thing about this building was that it was patched with signs 
    regarding the dangerous rocket fuel. </font></p>

            know exactly what it is about these Cold War relecs, but they're really 
            neat to see in real life. I don't encourage anyone to be overly sneaky, 
            but if you have one near you, it might be worth riding through some 
            day. Its just amazing to me that these were essentially in people's 
            back yards and no one really thought much of it. If I had a bunch 
            of missiles near my house, it may concern me... actually, it might 
            make me feel better as well. I'm rambling. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Long 
            story short, you can imagine these places were a big deal at the time, 
            yet no one local really seems to know much about them. I guess people 
            just minded their own in those days and trusted the government. Today 
            I'm sure you'd see tons of protests. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">As I mentioned before, one 
    of the batteries had a bunch of strands of old barbed wire around it on the 
    ground. I don't know why, but it did appear that it was collapsing. I crossed 
    the barbed wire, hoping it was there because the batter was unlocked, and 
    I quickly became tangled in it. It was old razor wire. It was still sharp... 
    like really sharp. In the future I will not cross razor wire. Lesson learned... 
    until next time.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The control site was a bust. 
    I arrived, and the gates were locked. I walked in to the woods a little to 
    see if I could see anything better and I quickly realized I was in the company 
    of bulls or cows or something big and brown and annoyed with me. I then promptly 
    high tailed it out of there and went to the next site... <a href="herminienike.html">Herminie</a>.</font></p>
