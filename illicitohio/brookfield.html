  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Clearly I had been a bit 
    slow to update the site. I guess I just needed something to inspire me to 
    get out, get some pictures, and do the update. I found just what I was looking 
    for when I finally made the trip out to see the old Nike Site in Brookfield... 
    which ended up not being a Nike Site after all. More on that later, but before 
    I go any further, let me thank the wonderful people over at <a href="http://radomes.org/" target="_blank">radomes.org.</a> 
    These guys cleared up many questions and set me straight on many misconceptions. 
    Their site is unreal. Check it out!</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">So 
            back to the topic at hand. I made the trip out to the former AFS in 
            September of 2007. I actually made two seperate trips. The first was 
            with my girlfriend, but we were unfortunately pulled away early due 
            to some family issues, so I made a return trip early the following 
            Monday morning on my way to Columbus Ohio. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">The 
            site is really easy to find. I really don't recommend checking it 
            out though. More on that...</font></p>

  </table>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Long story short, visit 
    number one went fine. Visit number two actually went fine, but it was a close 
    call. Just as I was about to leave the site, I rounded a building to head 
    down the road out of the complex when above the weeds I saw the light bar 
    of Brookfield's finest creeping my way with a police car attached to the bottom 
    of it. I wasn't there to cause trouble, but that doesn't always matter, so 
    I decided to make a run for it just to be safe. I ran until I figured the 
    officer would be close enough to be able to see me, by sort of calculating 
    his approximate distance in my mind. Right about when he would have been able 
    to see, I ducked in to what should have been brush. It was jagger bushes... 
    lots of them. It hurt. I waited a moment, got out of the bush, and hid in 
    a less painful spot. The officer patrolled the site and then left. I quickly 
    followed him and headed home. Long story short, they do watch this place. 
    The guys at radomes had the sense to ask permission. I did not. Sorry local 
    police guys... but no harm no fowl, right? </font></p>

          Radomes for their information... without them, I would have been lost. 
          Their info is much more detailed and can be found <a href="http://radomes.org/cgi-bin/museum/acwinfo2x.cgi?site=%22Brookfield%2BAFS,%2BOH%22&key=BrookfieldAFSOH&doc=BrookfieldAFSOH" target="_blank">here.</a> 
          I could spend hours at their site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The Brookfield site was not a Nike 
          Missile site as apparently believed by the Brookfield city engineers 
          when they named the road on which it resides. It was actually used by 
          The 662nd Radar Squadron from 1952 until 1959 when they were relocated 
          to Oakdale PA where they apparently spent their days hiding UFOs from 
          conspiracy theorists.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Once the squadron moved to PA, the site 
    was used as a Gap Filler, which is exactly what it sounds like it would be, 
    throughout the 1960s. I'm not sure exactly what date the base was decommissioned, 
    but pictures of the site from the 1980s show it to be relatively still intact. 
    See a 1980's photo on the radomes site <a href="http://radomes.org/museum/photos/recent/BrookfieldOH.jpg" target="_blank">here.</a></font></p>

            linked in the text above is of the building you are seeing next to 
            you. The tower that is next to it was for the gap filler radar I believe 
            and was eventually removed. The towers that are on site now are not 
            originals and are used for cell phone companies. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">I'm not sure why the 
            cell companies would bother using these old sites, except that maybe 
            the research done by the military proves them to be good, clear, high 
            up, locations? I'm really not sure, but it certainly confused me at 
            first because I assumed these were original towers... then again, 
            I also assumed this was a missile base and it was not. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So there you have it... It wouldn't be 
    a Military Site if I didn't use the words Cold War Era Relic. These places 
    were really something though. These types of places are scattered all over 
    the country. Its weird how this entire complex was just hiding out behind 
    a row of houses off the edge of route 7. If you didn't know it was there, 
    you'd just assume it was a farm road, or something like that. I also had to 
    ask myself who the hell wanted to live near this place back when it was operating? 
    The houses along 7 mostly appeared to be 1970's era houses, so maybe no one 
    lived there. I don't know if these places were really targets, but I would 
    imagine that the enemy would have every reason to want to take out radar.

    <tr> 
      <td width="48%" height="308"><div align="center"> 
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">So 
            what was learned on this trip? Not every military site from the 60's 
            was a Nike site. Its worth mentioning by the way that Nike sites were 
            part of the Nike Missile Defense program... its a type of missile. 
            My understanding from all of the info provided by the guys at Radomes, 
            and from reading around the net is that this was originally just early 
            warning radar. I had originally thought the layout (pictured below) 
            with the outlying buildings was because those buildings would have 
            housed something dangerous like... missiles. Not so. The guys from 
            Radomes informed me that the distance was to avoid interference between 
            Ground to Air, and Air to Ground signals. This place opened up a whole 
            world of info I previously knew nothing about, and I can't quit reading 
            about it. Cool stuff.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Before scrolling below 
    for additional photos, here is an overview of the site. You can see the gap 
    between the up and down signals on the far left and right. The white thing 
    is a watertower that was built around 1994. Next to it are 4 remaining family 
    housing units. To the right of the arrow is the mess hall, and North (above) 
    that are the four barracks buildings. At the very top of that row is a rec 
    area. If you look really closely, you can see the base of a radar sphere toward 
    the lower left. Near that you'll find the communications building, a water 
    storage tank, and some other garage type buildings. Pictures of all of these, 
    except the radar sphere base are either below, or in the gallery <a href="brookfield/page_0001.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
