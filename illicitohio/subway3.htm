    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>I was most excited about seeing one of 
      the stations. The first station we found was a little bit of a let down. 
      It still was unbelievable to think that we were under Cincinnati in an 
      unused subway station. How different it would look if there were people in 
      here waiting for a train. Of course we'd be dead if that were the case!

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>The two openings lead to the 
      stairways. I'm not sure of the exact location of this tunnel because I 
      know nothing about Cincinnati or the location of anything there. If I 
      remember right it was about 15 minutes in to the tunnel that we found this 
      station, so if anyone knows the location feel free to let me know.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Here are the stairs. I was hoping we'd 
      be down far enough that there would be stairs, a landing with a turn, then 
      more stairs like in NY and DC subways. Unfortunately the subway isn't that 
      low. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Here's another view of the stairs that 
      have been capped off by cement. It appears that the cement top is at 
      ground level. I'm curious if there are any signs of this on the top side 
      or if there is a road of building there now.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>This is looking across the station, 
      rails, center wall, and on to the station on the other side. I didn't 
      venture over there but I'm guessing it looked about the same as the 
      station we were in. It was difficult to get over there so we left it 
      alone. </FONT></FONT>
