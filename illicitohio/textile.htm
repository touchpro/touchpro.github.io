  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Thanks to a reader tip, 
    Andy and I were able to explore one of the coolest Columbus Buildings we're 
    been in since the last time I made that claim. The 700,000 square foot Columbus 
    Coated Fabrics building near 5th and Grant has been abandoned since 2001 when 
    the shop closed its doors. Although I was aware of the building, I wasn't 
    aware that it was standing wide open. </font></p>

            visitor to the site shot me an email asking why I hadn't featured 
            the building. In the process of looking for the building that I though 
            the reader was talking about, I stumbled upon the CCF building only 
            to realize that was the building the reader was talkign about. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">I 
            was unusually able to reach Andy of <a href="http://www.forgottenoh.com/">www.forgottenoh.com/</a> 
            and we decided to give it a try. Less than 24 hours later we were 
            walking through the wide open door. This was absolutely the most open 
            building we've ever entered.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">My expectations were low 
    to be honest. While it looked huge, it also looked like it was going to be 
    in such poor condition that we wouldn't be able to walk though it. I was wrong. 
    The building really was in pretty good shape except for a few select areas. 
    My understanding is that the building suffered a fire although we couldn't 
    find evidence of this at night (no smell, but one section had been bulldozed). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">It was freezing cold, so 
    we assumed we'd probably run in to a few homeless people, but we didn't. We 
    ran in to lots of evidence of very recent homeless, but they apparently avoided 
    us which was nice. </font></p>

      <td width="49%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">All I can say about 
          this place is that it's huge. It was basically a textile company from 
          what I could find. According to a lantern article that I found, the 
          company originally made horse blankets and buggy tops back when it opened 
          in 1902. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">All evidence from the various documents 
          we found inside was that the company survived up until around late 2000 
          or so. The lantern article seems to back this assumption up noting that 
          the company closed in 2001.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I couldn't get over the size of this place. 
    It seemed to go on forever. Several times we found ourselves slightly disoreiented 
    due to the maze of rooms attached to other rooms that were attached to stairs 
    that led to another room that had a ladder going to a fourth demention where 
    republicans handed out money to starving children and democrats watched fox 
    news. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">This was one of the 
            few buildings we've been in that was so large that some areas were 
            nearly untouched. Sure people had been there, but the avereage board 
            vandels had so much other stuff to choose from that they never bothered 
            to venture way back in to the bowels of this place. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The main office on 
            the front was trashed and full of homeless beds and whatnot. The warehouse 
            offices weren't too bad for the most part and the actual open warehouse 
            type spaces were virtually empty, but untouched aside from the occasional 
            piece of krylon artwork.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Once you're inside 
            this place you're pretty much sheltered from the world... good for

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So you reach a point where you can't say 
    too much about a big empty building. The pictures say more than words. The 
    most impressive part in my opinion was the section where part of the building 
    had been demolished. It really felt like something out of Mad Max beyond thunderdome. 
    Basically you were standing in a large courtyard feeling thing with the remains 
    of buildings on all sides of you. Some of the buildings are several stories, 
    so it was really sort of overwhealming in a way. I tried to get pictures of 
    it but the Aagus Digital Camera wasn't cooperating with the darkness.</font></p>

            other highlights of the night would include the obligitory roof visit.

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">In 
            addition to the views from the roof, the walls of this place are covered 
            in some high quality spray art. I'm not usually one for messing up 
            someone's property, but I'll give credit where its due. There was 
            some nice work here. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Possibly 
            one of the most surprising finds was the stripped dump truck and stripped 
            work truck sitting in the parking lot next to one of the buildings. 
            The dump truck had trees growing out of the bed.</font></p>

    hopefully.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">One last thing to note. The new site design 
    has some major flaws, but it really helps me to be able to update much more 
    quickly. The pictures you are viewing were taken just over 24 hours prior 
    to this being posted, and it only took that long because I was too tired last 
    night to post them. </font></p>
