    one of those places I'd always heard about but never visited. What I never 
    really realized is how close it is to Moxahala Park in Zannesville. On a recent 
    check up on Moxahala I decided to give the prison a try.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The 
            prison is actually pretty easy to find if you're in roseville. Its 
            right on what appears to be the main road through the small town. 
            Right as you're leaving town you can see the tower. The prison is 
            on the opposite side of the road, first noted by some small abandoned 
            houses, and then by the larger cell block building. This prison was 
            one of a series of remote prisions related to the main state pen in 
            Columbus Ohio. The inmates that were well behaved and wanted to do 
            work duty were shipped out to Roseville and Junction City for work. 
            Both the pen and Junction City are featured elsewhere on the site.

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Roseville is now the only 
    one of the three left standing. The Junction City prison was destroyed in 
    2005 and the Main State Pen was destroyed in the late 1990s to make way for 
    the Columbus Blue Jackets arena. </font></p>

      <td width="53%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> The 
          coolest thing about the Roseville Prison is that the towers are still 
          standing. Most of the cells are gone like they always are in these old 
          prisons, but there are other signs of prison live still around Roseville.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The field next to 
          the prison with a wall and fence was used for prison baseball games. 
          The score board is still standing on the large wall. Inside of some 
          of the buildings are old movie theater style pews. I'm not certain that 
          they are original. There are bars over the main entrance door and some 
          of the windows. There are a few small cells left on the first floor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The Roseville Prison also was used 
          as a haunted house for a while, as was the State Pen in downtown Columbus.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">My trip to the prison was relatively uneventful. 
    It was freezing cold and it was getting late, so it was really dark inside 
    many of the buildings. The sky had that dreary grey look to it making it that 
    much less appealing. By the time it was all said and done I was depressed... 
    it didn't help that it was my birthday. Another day older, poorer, and I'm 
    standing in a crumbling prison... </font></p>

            say. The prison is certainly a cool visit, but don't do it in the 
            dead of winter. I didn't end up seeing the roof or either of the houses 
            because the liquid on my eyes had frozen and my eyelids had frozen 
            closed. Maybe not, but it was chilly and I had a nice warm car waiting 
            for me. </font></p>
