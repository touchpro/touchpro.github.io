    the two that started it all for my website. Idora was actually one of the 
    first abandoned places I'd ever seen. I tried to enter it once when I was 
    young but I heard a loud noise and bolted. Many years later I visited and 
    used the pictures I took to start this website. </font></p>

            park in Youngstown Ohio that survived many years until a fire destroyed 
            its main attraction. The park was one of the few old trolly parks 
            that made it past the 1970's. What finally ended the parks success 
            was the 1984 fire that destroyed the Wild Cat coster which was named 
            as one of the best coasters in the country at the time. </font></p>

    ride, a spark or heat from a welder ignited the coaster. Firefighters from 
    all over the area fought the fire but were not able to save much of the coaster. 
    The fire also destroyed the midway, park offices, and other structures. </font></p>

          using carnival trailers and other stand ins, but it simply wasn't enough. 
          The park had already been under some strain and the loss of the wildcat 
          was too much. The park was auction off in the years following leaving 
          only the buildings, coaster remains, and the ballroom. The ballroom 
          was used for a short time after the park closed to host dinners, receptions, 
          fund raisers, etc. Eventually a church bought the grounds and simply 
          did nothing with it until it was far too late.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">For many years the park stood with most 
    structures intact. Slowly but surely many of them dissappeared from the landscape. 
    By the end, the ballroom, the french fry stand, the icee stand, the Jack Rabbit 
    Coaster, and WildCat were the only major remains. </font></p>

            the park today. The coasters were finally bulldozed after a fire destroyed 
            the ballroom in 2001. The park actually suffered three fires total. 
            The first in 1984 ultimately closed the park. A 1986 fire destroyed 
            some of the Wildcat's remains. The 2001 fire destroyed the ballroom 
            which led to the bulldozing of the Wildcat, buildings, Jack Rabbit 
            Coaster, and basically anything else that was standing.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I've made several trips in to the park 
    over the years, one of which caused me a painful visit to the med center to 
    have rubber and rust dug from my foot after stepping on a big rusty nail sticking 
    out of a piece of wood. The pictures here are from various trips.</font></p>

          really isn't much of anything other than a few foundations and some 
          wood. Its really a shame that the chuch that purchased the park did 
          not do anything with it. There were plenty of people that were trying 
          to lead efforts to at least preserve some of the signs and possibly 
          even the coaster and it simply did not happen in time. I do not know 
          if the church blocked those efforts of if they simply didn't materialize 
          in time. </font></p></td>

    features on the site that I visited before and after it was abandoned. I was 
    under 10 years old when it burnt, but I do recall the fires and I do recall 
    going to see the remains with my parents from our car. The neighboring streets 
    slowly became less desireable until it became somewhat unsafe to visit. To 
    this day some of the nearby streets are rough.</font></p>
