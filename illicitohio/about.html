    <div align="left"> 
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Courier New">Www.illicitohio.com</font><font face="Courier New"> 
        is a site I started back in early college during the down time we experienced 
        at my college job. Sometimes we would have as many as four or five hours 
        where we were stuck at work with no work to do and great internet access. 
        I first made a 'me and my friends' type of site just to learn the basics 
        of creating a website. Remember, this is back in 1995 -96, so html was 
        new to me. I quickly realized that I didn't even want to read the garbage 
        I had put on my site, so I looked for a topic that interested me and gave 
        me room to expand. I had always been in to snooping around old empty buildings 
        just to check them out, so I made that my topic. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">This is where my site's link 
        to forgottenoh comes in. The owner of that site was a co-worker and friend 
        of mine. We both decided to start our sites one bored afternoon in the 
        basement computer lab. I knew some html and taught what I could to Andy 
        at forgottenoh. He then built on that, and I learned some things back 
        from him. Somehow neither of us were overly competitive, so we just helped 
        each other out and let each other know of some cool places to check out. 
        Back then we visited quite a few places together. As the years went on 
        and we moved on with differnt jobs, we sort of lost contact other than 
        an occasional email. Andy has been able to expand his site vastly. The 
        massive amount of effort he put in to research, travel, etc has resulted 
        in one of the, if not the best resource for this sort of thing on the 
        web. My site hasn't grown quite so well, but I have been able to keep 
        updating it from time to time. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">The site I originally started 
        was just a geocities free website. At the time when we first made the 
        websites, there were no limits on the amount of monthly usage and file 
        size like there are now, so we basically had found a free hobby. My site 
        took off pretty well considering. I couldn't believe I was getting emails 
        from people that I'd never met about the site. I really only had a few 
        things featured at the time. The direction of the site was basically anything 
        I could find that was abandoned. That really hasn't changed, but I did 
        branch off with one unique focus... the Amusement parks which eventually 
        spawned sbno.illicitohio.com. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Due to growing up near Youngstown, 
        I had always visited Idora park, first when it was open, and then once 
        it was closed. That was the first unique location that I went after. At 
        the time I had already covered the State Pen in Columbus, and the tunnels 
        under OSU (that is a touchy area, hence the lack of photos). The Amusement 
        park was noteable because it eventually led to me finding Chippewa Lake 
        Park, and after I had two parks, I had a unique flavor to the site. I 
        certainly wasn't the first to cover that stuff, but there really weren't 
        any abandoned building sites that were doing parks that I knew of. It 
        was more or less either Amusement park sites with a mention of an old 
        run down park, or abandoned building sites with no mention of amusement 
        parks. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Over the years, the rest has 
        basically been history. Due to traffic usage caps and the large number 
        of photos I feature, I had to leave the free geocities website and instead 
        go with a geocities pay service. Their ploy of capping sites and then 
        offering a pay alternative worked on me. I purchased a monthly service 
        plan and moved everything over to www.illicitohio.com and sbno.illicitohio.com. 
        To this day I've yet to update all links, email addresses, etc, so you 
        may find a dead end... hopefully not.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">There have been many significant 
        gaps in progress here. I simply don't have the kind of time that I used 
        to have to update the site. Lately I've tried to update and add a few 
        things just to get my mind off of other things, but I'm alway way behind. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Over the years there have been 
        some highlites and a few lows. I've only really recieved one nasty email 
        as of this time. I've had a few talking about broken links, poor configuration, 
        slow loading, etc, but they've mostly been friendly and helpful. The one 
        nasty email was in relation to Americana park. At the time I made the 
        page the park was to be closed for good. I commented that the entrance 
        we used to photo the park would be an easy way to sneak in for free, thinking 
        it would never reopen anyhow, and then when it later reopened, I was accused 
        of telling people how to sneak in to the park, and screw the park out 
        of money. I removed the reference only because it was a valid complaint 
        once the park had reopened. The person was still quite an ass about the 
        entire thing considering. If you're thinking of sending me an nasty email, 
        just remember, you'll only be the 2nd jerk out of hundreds and hundres 
        of people that email me. Nobody wants to be a jerk, right? </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Some of the highlites of the 
        site have having photos featured on the cover of a magazine, and band's 
        album cover, and various other websites. I always really enjoy the idea 
        that kids use photos in their school reports as well. I've actually recieved 
        a few emails regarding that and often wondered what the teachers thought 
        when the kids gave their reports. I was lucky enough to be asked to do 
        a channel 10 news thing with Andy and later one with channel 4. Channel 
        10 never aired theirs. Channel 4 did air theirs and I couldn't help but 
        laugh at myself. I believe I frustrated the crew as I tend to have a bit 
        of mouth on me when it comes to cussing... which usually results in unusable 
        footage. Regardless they did a good job and I really enjoyed the experience. 
        Ultimately the best thing about the site is the email I receive from people 
        who read it.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">As I write this, I'm working 
        on the new version that you are reading it from. Its pushing midnight 
        and I'm dead tired, but I really just can't pull myself away from this 
        adicting hobby once I get started. Its weird how something so simple can 
        absorb a person, but enough about that... let's talk about a few things 
        that come up often.</font></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New"><strong><em>Is 
        this trespassing? </em></strong> </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Sort of, but don't intentions 
        count? Probably not, but we tread lightly and leave no signs of our visit 
        behind other than the pictures. These places have been left to rot away, 
        so a quick walk though seems harmless. Ultimately I'm in the wrong I'm 
        sure. Also note, with very rare exception, nothing is taken from these 
        places. If its something completely worthless, like a used score card 
        from a mini golf course or something, I might take it, but otherwise, 
        nothing is ever taken regardless of how tempting it may be.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><em><br>
        <strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">How did you get started?</font></strong></em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><strong> 
        </strong></font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Boredom. Actually my Father 
        and I went to an abandoned hotel in Daytona Beach during a vacation. We 
        were walking down A1A and came across a hotel, right in the mix with the 
        nice places, with the front door standing open. We barely even entered 
        the place, and found old 50s postcards all over the floor. I thought that 
        was pretty amazing (I was a kid remember)but that was the first step in 
        me being interested in this stuff. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Do you make any money from the site? 
        </font></em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">None. I lose about $15 per month 
        on it. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Can I use some of your pictures?</font> 
        </em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Depends on the use. You can 
        use them for just about anything other than making them look like pictures 
        that you took. Email me to let me know and give credit please.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Why bother? </font></em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Its just a hobby like anything 
        else. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><em><br>
        <strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Isn't this nerdy? </font></strong></em></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Yes. Its far from being a major 
        part of my life. I'm a dork anyhow. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font size="4">What is next? </font></em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Whatever comes along. I have 
        nothing specific in mind right now. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">What is your favorite place? </font></em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">There are a few. Heritage USA 
        was really cool, but I wish I had seen more. The oppritunity just wasn't 
        there when I was in town. Chippewa Lake has always been really amazing. 
        The Prison was top notch, but I never got interior pictures. The staduim 
        in Miami Florida was really cool just because I didn't expect to find 
        something like that. Really, they all have an interesting history when 
        you are in them. The Seneca was really neat, but freaky due to the crack 
        smoker that lived there. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Tell me more about the news, or magazine, 
        books, etc.</font></em> </strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Andy of ForgottenOh and I did 
        channel 10 news back when we were in college. We did Channel 4 news in 
        early 2005. The band that used my photo was a small rock outfit from down 
        south by the name of Squint. Nice guys, good band, great music. The magazine 
        cover was an industry magazine for the entertainment industry. I've lost 
        track of the various news articles, but occasionally someone will put 
        a blurb about the site in a news paper or something. Andy used a couple 
        of our pictures in his book called forgotten columbus. That's all I can 
        think of right now. Hopefully there will be more. The biggest hurdle seems 
        to be me not getting back to reporters quickly enough because I slack 
        on my email. Sorry!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New"><br>
        <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">What high tech camera do you use?</font></em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">Nearly all of the pictures on 
        the site that I've taken were taken by one of two wonderful cameras. The 
        early pictures were mostly snapped with a free Marlboro Cigarettes Cannon 
        Camera that was discarded by someone else. Eventually that died on me 
        and I was too cheap to buy anything else, so the site lagged. I eventually 
        sprung for a digital camera which really revolutionized the site. I used 
        the Argus 2.1 megapixel digital camera for quite some time. It was quite 
        a piece of work, but I don't have to worry about breaking it, so its actually 
        perfect. As of 2006 or so, I upgraded to a Nikon CoolPix L4 which takes 
        decent pictures, but sucks in low light and has the absolute slowest flash 
        recharge time ever. It was also accidentally on the wrong setting for 
        a few of the sections (the blue looking Cleveland Pics). As of December 
        2007 I purchased a $19 tripod that is looking like it may be the best 
        investment in quite some time. No more crappy flash pictures in moderately 
        low light. The Mike Tyson and Davids Restaurant are the first to benefit.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New"><strong><em>Do you really call 
        this garbage photography?</em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="5effee" size="4" face="Courier New">No. 
        They're just pictures. I'd like to someday try good photography though.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New"><strong><em>How 
        do you find these places?</em></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="5effee" size="4" face="Courier New">I find 
        them by keeping my eyes open, and from getting tips from nice folks like 
        you. Drop me a line if you know of something cool that I should go to 
        check out. </font></p>
