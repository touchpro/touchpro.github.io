    an unusual one. Long story short, which never happens because I'm clearly 
    the wordy person you know, a reporter from the Warren Tribune got in touch 
    with me and wanted to go out and check out some abandoned buildings. Being 
    the media whore that I am, I was more than willing, so we meant up at her 
    office, and headed out to check out a few places in the Youngstown area. I 
    had three places in mind, and this was one of them. You see, if you're as 
    much of a dork as me, you actually have a mental arsenal of abandoned buildings 
    for the places you're familiar with.</font></p>

            three places to check out were Republic Rubber, Youngstown Sheet and 
            Tube, and of course, the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Rail Road tower. 
            As of this writing, we hadn't made it to Republic, although I've been 
            on my own without a camera in the past, we barely were able to check 
            out Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and we were successful at walking around 
            the one of the two Rail Road towers at the old P&amp;LERR yard. The 
            other was near a business that is still being run, and we didn't want 
            to find ourselves in trouble. I frankly thought that getting caught 
            would make a great news article, but at the same time, I wasn't up 
            for it on this particular day. </font></p>

    someone parked near where we were trying to park. Without giving too much 
    away, you actually have to park across the tracks from this place and walk 
    over the currently used tracks. There is pretty much no other reason to be 
    parked there, so we thought maybe we'd run in to someone. As we approached 
    the building, I could hear hammering. It was a scrapper removing scrap from 
    the building. I'm not a fan of theft, but in this case, the building is going 
    to complete waste, it'll never be used again, it wasn't being taken care of 
    at all, so if someone can do the hard work of removing this stuff, make a 
    buck, and recycle in the process, I'm all for it. </font></p>

          down the nicest guy you could run in to in an abandoned building. He 
          welcomed us in, asked us not to take any pictures of him, told us the 
          safest steps to use, what to watch out for, etc. He was working his 
          butt off to get what he wanted... this wasn't the obvious stuff, but 
          rather stuff that was hard to remove. He even checked on us before he 
          left, which required walking all the steps to the top of the building, 
          and told us the easy way out. He was super nice, and I hope he was able 
          to come back for his scrap before someone else took it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So we walked through the building

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">From what we could tell, the building closed 
    in the late 1980s. There were employee records going to 1988 if I recall correctly 
    as well as some magazines. It was obvious that the building had been wired 
    heavily for communications.. of course back then it wasn't with a network 
    like you'd have today. This was old school solid wire telephone type connections. 
    I assume that operating a rail yard from one building isn't easy. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">I'm sure the rail 
            road guys will correct me on this, but basically I believe these buildings 
            were used to weigh the cars as well as direct them to which train 
            they would be taking to get where they are going. I believe that the 
            cars came in one side, were pushed up the hill by pusher trains, weighed, 
            documented, etc, then allowed to roll down the other side, and were 
            steered to the train in which they would be attached. Gravity would 
            give them enough momentum to connect to the train at the bottom and 
            hopefully no workers would accidentally find themselves in the middle 
            of that mess. That is about the extent of my rail yard knowledge, 
            and it may be totally wrong. I get that from watching Conrail yards 
            as a child when we'd drive past it, and from playing with my hot wheels 
            rail set.</font></p>

            yards, feeder tracks, all that stuff. You could tell they once had 
            some really cool windows that leaned outward. I'm guessing this place

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Before long, Amanda, the 
    reporter, had completed her first walk through of an abandoned building. I 
    don't know if she enjoyed it. I think I enjoyed it, but I have a low entertainment 
    threshold. I can enjoy anything as long as its not too fun. It was a cool 
    building. The stripped internals took away from it slightly, but I still had 
    a good time poking around. This was my third place using the tripod, and although 
    the pictures aren't great, I think I'm learning to use it better. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Last but not least, its worth mentioning 
    that we ran across the river to the old sheet and tube building to check out 
    some rail cars. In the process, the reporter, who was driving, picked up a 
    screw in her tire. She seemed agitated and we discovered for good reason because 
    it was leaking (sometimes screws plug their own hole. I've had one in my tire 
    for months). We drove to AutoZone, and me being the manly man that I am, plugged 
    the tire at the local speedway who I have to mention because they gave us 
    free air. So now... the picture. There are two pages of pictures with descriptions, 
    or you can skip to the archive of just pictures.</font></p>
