            that my father and I took together. I had received an auction notice 
            in the mail for the park, and I couldn't resist. Basically Geauga 
            Lake had been around me entire life. It was always a smaller park 
            than Cedar Point, but still a decent size. Eventually it couldn't 
            compete on its own and was purchased by Six Flags and upgrade with 
            many of their cookie cutter coasters. Fast forward a few years, and 
            Cedar Fair (point) bought Six Flags out so that they would basically 
            own every major park in Ohio. They also own Kings Island now.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Geauga Lake was uniqe because 
    it had been an amusement park with a water park built in for many years... 
    long before you typically saw that sort of thing. It was also directly across 
    the lake from Sea World, so people would often visit both parks the same day. 
    You could see one from the other. </font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> I spent 
          a few childhood days on the water slides... they had a really cool one 
          where you went down on sleds and skimmed across the water... anyway, 
          I really loved the place back in the day. There was also a fun incident 
          on a waterslide where I was so little and light that I got passed by 
          a person while going down the slide. I was scared, so my dad said he'd 
          follow me next time so I didn't have to worry. We went back to the top 
          and I went for it. About half way down, I hear my dad yell &quot;Look 
          out!&quot; as he zooms past me on the slide. I can't win. </font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So anyway, Sea World eventually 
    folded due to lack of business. Its tough to have a sea park in northern Ohio. 
    Geauga Lake adopted part of the sea park, and then eventually closed the sea 
    attractions and built a water park there. As that water park developed, the 
    waterslides in the orignial park disappeared and were replaced with actual 
    rides. That was pretty much the layout that would remain for the duration... 
    the old sea world side as a waterpark, and the former Geauga Lake Park with 
    only rides.</font></p>

          <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So fast forward 
            many years to the post six flags days... After a couple years of operation, 
            Cedar Fair claimed that there wasn't enough business to keep the park 
            open and announced that they'd close the ride side and operate only 
            the water park. That led to the auctioning of the rides and to this 
            page that you're hopefully still reading now. Interesting side note, 
            it led to a first for yours truely on this site... something that 
            has been coming for a long time and finally came about when I least 
            expected it... more on that in a minute. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So my dad and I headed up 
    to the park. The entry was $10 for the auction preview. This is when you were 
    supposed to come check out the rides that you may want to buy. They knew their 
    audience well though because they were selling T-shirts, old maps, pictures, 
    etc... and for a mint. I'm thinking it was something like $80 for an old map 
    or something insane like that... maybe I'm completely wrong. I just remember 
    being shocked. </font></p>

          no one really told us anything about where to go, what to do, etc.. 
          it was basically just pay and go for it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">We went anywhere that 
          wasn't taped off with yellow tape. I was surprised how much access we

          whereever we wanted. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The rides were wide

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">At one point we decided 
    to go to the platform of the Log Flume ride... the platform turned in to the 
    actual flume (empty of course), and so on. As we were walking through the 
    flume, a security person finally walked by and said, please stick to the platforms... 
    no problem. We moved on to the double loop, some offices, maintanence buildings, 
    etc. At one point we found the coaster cars stored in a pavillion. My dad 
    suggested getting in one to get a picture, which I did, then I got stuck... 
    then I finally got out with much pain only to find out that the pictured didn't 
    take, so I did it all over again. Dumb.</font></p>

            short, we worked our way from through several shops, coasters, flat 
            rides, the water rides, etc, and to the classic coaster at the end 
            of the park... the raging wolf bobs. This is where my first occured. 
            I stepped off of the platform on to the brake run to get a picture 
            of the lift hill. I actually had to wait for another guy ahead of 
            me to do so, but as luck would have it, I picked a bad time. The head 
            maintanence guy rolled up in his golf cart and spyed me off the platform. 
            This wasn't the guy from before. I heard a yell... uh oh... this guy 
            was heated.</font></p>

    asked me to get off the platform which I quickly did. Problem solved? Not 
    so fast... he then pushed the issue... why was I there, who did I think I 
    was, wasn't I told when I entered to stay only on platforms (no actually), 
    etc. I apologized. Not enough... was I planning to buy the ride? It went on 
    and on. I was very curtious, but that wasn't enough apparently. He was heated.

          He informed me that I was out of there... thrown out of the park. By 
          then he was calmed down a little... we actually BS'd with him for a 
          second or two and he then said he was sorry but he had already called 
          security on me. We started heading for the gate as rain was approaching 
          and we had the top down on the convertable. As we headed that way, the 
          security guys passed us going to nab us. We just kept trucking.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">We didn't get far before 
    we were told to stop. We stopped. This was a high pressure group... chests 
    puffed, about 5 guys, one in a suit, and found in uniform. They asked if we 
    stepped off of the platform. I answered honestly. I know I sound bitter here, 
    but honestly, they were thrilled... they got to throw someone out! They informed 
    us that we were out of there immeadiately and they would escort us out... 
    now this is where the wisdom that only a father could have comes out... my 
    dad immeadiately says, &quot;well good, you can show us the quickest way out 
    because we're trying to get to the car before the rain... the top is down...&quot; 
    never in my life have I seen the wind get taken out of 5 guys sails so quickly. 
    They were no longer throwing us out, but helping us get to our car quickly. 
    Thanks Dad!!</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">It was at this point that 
    my picture tour ended... about half done. By the time we got to the gate, 
    we were all talking and being nice to one another, so all was well... sort 
    of. I stewed a little about the original guy being a jerk, but so is life. 
    Over all, a great trip, but I missed one side of the park unfortunately. So 
    I often get the question, but until now, the answer was always no.. I have 
    now been thrown out of a place! </font></p>
