    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Although much of the content of this 
      Site is focused on Columbus, the actual intent is to cover all of Ohio, or 
      at least as much as possible. Given that fact, it was impossible to resist 
      the Cincinnati abandoned Subway tunnels. Of course, as with all of our 
      explorations, we did screw this up a little. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Many of these pictures are really bad 
      because of the lack of light in the tunnels. This tunnel had a little more 
      light than the one on the following pages because it was much shorter. 
      This tunnel was cut off during the making of I-75. Unfortunately we didn't 
      realize this until we were already in there.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>Climbing in though the gate that has 
      been patched many times proved to be the most difficult entrance to date. 
      We got scraped, snagged, and injured in ways I didn't know possible. Once 
      we were in we were disappointed to find out that we were in a tunnel that 
      ended some 100 yards later. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=yellow>We turned around as advised by the 
      message above. This picture is taken looking toward our exit. Exiting 
      through the hole we came in through proved to be more difficult than 
      entering. I think I remember being upside down and being able to see the 
      bottom of my feet at one point. FUN!!!
