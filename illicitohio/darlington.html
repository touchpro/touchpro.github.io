        <TD width="100%"><FONT size=4>Darlington Lake was a small park located 
          in Dalington Pennsylvania not far across the border from my hometown 
          of East Palestine Ohio. My Grandparents, Father, and aunts lived in 
          one of the lake cottages during a great part of their childhood years. 
          The park started life as a small lake resort area similar to Chippewa 
          Lake Park, or even Cedar Point. The lake never ended up becoming a full 
          fledged amusement park like some of the others, but still provided great 
          times for both visitors and relatives. <BR>
          <BR>
          After the recent and unfortunate loss of my Grandfather, my Aunt came 
          across some postcards from the lake. She was gracious enough to provide 
          the postcards as well as a brief account of her memories of the days 
          she spent living at the Lake. I have provided scans of both of those 
          cards here as well as a poorly made map that I recreated from my Aunt's 
          hand drawn map and some highlights of her memories of the Lake. There 
          is also a sattelite picture of the park taken from terraserver.com.

          Darlington lake is about one hour 'westish' of Pittsburgh. My father 
          spent much of his life there as did his siters and parents. To this 
          day, two of the sisters, my aunts, are still living there. The lake 
          is still used for swimming, but there is no longer camping there, a 
          dike has been built separating the lake and the cottages, and most of 
          the old cottages are now used as homes. <BR>

        <TD width="100%"><div align="left"><FONT size=4>My Aunt was kind enough 
            to put together a small account of some of the memories she has of 
            the lake. <BR>
            <BR>
            One of the post cards that she found was a postcard sent from their 
            Aunt Lucille sent to my Great Grandparents (her parents). The other 
            shows pictures of boys and girls swimming in the "lower pool". There 
            is a wooden slide and a diving platform in the picture, as well as 
            the bridge on the main road with a family watching the swimming going 
            on. My aunt notes that the water was so deep around the diving platform 
            that no one ever touched bottom when diving. She also notes that the 
            slide was wooden, and very hard on bathing suits. Ouch! <BR>
            <BR>
            Downstream from the lower pool was a dam. People fished by the dam 
            where the water was also very deep. The dam was a popular place for 
            tanning. My aunt also mentions that brave souls would sit under the 
            water coming through the dam and cool off. The area under the dam 
            was referred to as the hole. She mentions tha she almost drown there 
            once and had to be pulled from the water. She isn't alone. She also 
            mentions that she pulled others from the water as she grew up. <BR>
            <BR>
            People entered the recreation area via the upper road. Entrants came 
            to a 6' tall fence covered in pink roses and a tollbooth. The entry 
            fee was .25 cents. People who lived there entered free because the 
            belonged to the Darlington lake Association. <BR>
            <BR>
            My Aunt spent her teen years like many others at the lake at the pool 
            or dancing to the jukebox. Living in the area allowed my aunt to meet 
            people from all of the place including a family from New York who 
            stayed in a cottage rented out by her aunt. They taught her to sing 
            "Sidewalks of New York". There were also boyscout groups that stayed 
            at the lake. My Aunt recounts a time when the boyscouts were rained 
            out. Most left, taking the food with them, and the remaining scouts 
            had to live on green tomatoes intil their parents came to get them. 
            <BR>
            <BR>
            According to my aunts description, the lake housed a large picnic 
            house with a stage as well as a dance hall with refreshment stand. 
            <BR>
            <BR>
            The Resort area at the lake slowly faded away to become mostly just 
            a swimming area with the cottages being used as homes. I plan on getting 
            some pictures of the lake are as it stands now. Below are a map and 
            a sattelite photo of the lake. They don't really correspond well at 
            all. One is actually facing the other direction than the other. <BR>
