  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">The Gates of Hell are a 
    Columbus Landmark in my eyes. The area, also known as the blood bowl, is basically 
    Urban Exploration 101. At a recent presentation by Andy of Forgotten Ohio, 
    someone in the audience mentioned the blood bowl and everyone laughed. Out 
    of the group of 30 or so, maybe five were not aware of it. If you are one 
    of the few... you will soon know what little there is to know of the Gates 
    of Hell.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New"> Everything 
            that can be said about the Gates is in the minds of the thosands of 
            Columbus youth that have made this their test grounds for counter 
            culture activities over the years. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">In 
            my estimation, the gates have seen many a teenager sneaking a kiss 
            from a girl on a spooky night with friends. More people have probaby 
            gotten stoned here than and other place in the city. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">My favorite thing about 
    the Gates is the sheer amound to pure stright forward art and emotion expressed. 
    There are no rules, no standards, no expectations. Kids will spray everything 
    from their names to song lyrics on the walls. Its the center of everything 
    that the capitol square is not. When one piece of art fades, something else 
    is simply painted in its place.</font></p>

      <td width="49%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I may be over selling 
          the Gates. Its not the greatest place on earth,but it is certainly the 
          best drainage culvert in the city. If you ever find yourself stuck near 
          the Tim Hortons just past henderson on High, take a trip back in to 
          the woods and find the Gates. Take a walk through the tunnel. You really 
          can't miss out on this simple yet essential landmark. I think it may 
          actually by a requirement for an OSU diploma now. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The area is named the Gates of Hell due 
    to the large metal structure that spans the opening of the tunnel. From a 
    distance it looks like what one would imagine the gates of hell to look like. 
    The area is also called the blood bowl due to a rumor of a skater being killed 
    skating here. The name really refers to the area surrounding the tunnel as 
    well as the tunnel. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The most notable feature of the actual 
    tunnel is the room in the center where there is little or no light. Due to 
    a bend in the tunnel you can basically get to a point where there is no light. 
    You can turn off your flash light and basically stand alone, or with friends, 
    in total isolation while only 20ft above you the city is in full swing. It 
    really is like the anti-city/anti-mainstream. Enjoy it. </font></p>
