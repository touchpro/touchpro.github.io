  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I decided to take a trip up to Euclid Beach 
    Park in Cleveland to see what remained. I was surprised how much remained 
    of the park. It doesn't look much like an amusement park anymore, but there 
    are certainly signs that the park existed. The first sign is... the old sign 
    actually. The old entrance gate is still standing as an entrance to the apartment 
    that currently stands on the grounds.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Like many of the abandoned 
            and defunct parks, Euclid Beach opened around the 1890's and closed 
            in the late 1960's. The park closed under the usual circumstances 
            and eventually became the apartment complex that currently stands 
            on the gounds. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Some signs of the 
            park were left and can be seen as of this writing by simply driving 
            back in to the apartment complex. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">As far as closed parks go, Euclid has had 
    pretty decent support for keeping the memories alive. The McDonald's on site 
    pays homage to the coaster with a small fake coaster on the side of the building. 
    The Racing Carosel was moved to Cedar Point where it is operated to this day. 
    The apartment's are named for the park and still use the original entrance 
    sign. Other rides are in storage waiting to be refurbished. </font></p>

          above preservation efforts, much of the site remains untouched. Basically 
          if it could be integrated in to the new use, they left it. The pier 
          still extends out on to the beach. Stairs still remain that took visitors 
          from the boardwalk down on to the beach. Many of these now dead end 
          in to the woods as trees have since grown on the former beach. There 
          are also many foundations as well as the old track for the turnpike 
          cars. </font></p></td>

    of nearly freezing to the ground from the wind on the lake. If you're ever 
    in the area, its worth taking the trip up to the lake to take a quick peek 
    around.</font></p>
