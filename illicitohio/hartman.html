            being renovated for what is now used as a banquet center. There are 
            also lofts for sale in the building from what I understand. More info 
            can probably be found at their site <a href="http://www.grand-productions.com/">HERE.</a></font></p>

            building has served a few purposes over the years. The most notable 
            were Hotel, Hospice, and Banking center. There are several vaults 
            in the building, some of which were left after the renovation.</font></p>

    so they had nothing to worry about.</font></p>

          coolest part in my opinion. We found several vaults and storage areas. 
          One section was full of water. There were other sections that had complete 
          darkness. I don't recall the exact reason but there was a moment where 
          we turned the lights off and sat in silence. I believe we thought we 
          had heard someone. I just recall me thinking that if my light had failed 
          to come back on, I would have never found my way out. I felt a slight 
          bit of panic for some reason. The mind can be a real pain in the butt 
          at times.</font></p>

            right in the midst of the the City near City Center Mall (soon to 
            be featured on this site if they don't get some more business in there 
            soon unfortunately). The building was empty through much of the 1990s.</font></p>

            of course after the same Hartman's as everything else in the city 
            with that name. Mr. Hartman made quite a chunk of change selling a 
            product that, from what I have read, didn't do much of anything... 
            other than make Mr. Hartman money. I suppose there is more to it than 
            that. </font></p>

    left over from a bank that had a branch on the first floor from the late 1920's. 
    Huntinton eventually bought the branch and later closed the location during 
    a time when the City wasn't doing too well.</font></p>

          to have worked out rather well so far. I've yet to go inside, but driving 
          by reveals an amazing turn around for a building that was really in 
          pretty bad shape.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The renovators seemed to really make 
          an effort to retains some of the original charm of the building. I hope

    even sat on the roof to BS for a while about the state of whatever was going 
    on at the time. We mused about going in to the old Ohio furniture building 
    which I later was able to explore, although it took me about 4 years before 
    I got around to it. (see the main street buildings section).</font></p>
