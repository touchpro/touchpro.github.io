  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Well I finally got a chance 
    to check out what I've been looking for... a missile base. Ultimately my goal 
    was to head in to a silo from an ICBM, but the Nike site was something I'd 
    been wanting to see as well. I finally got my chance when I headed down to 
    Wilmington Ohio. Let me first say that this land is privately owned and off 
    limits. You can not access this site, and the owner keeps live stock on the 
    land, and the cows will kill you. I think they might actually be bulls... 
    doesn't matter... they're mean.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">That 
            being said, I did venture breifly on to the property. I tried very 
            hard to get permission, but I could not locate the owner. I found 
            his house, knocked on the door, and no one was home. I waited around... 
            still nothing. I have no good excuse, but I'd driven so far and was 
            so curious, so I went for it. I scaled the fence, which had three 
            lines of barb wire at the top mind you, then quickly scaled the 2nd 
            fence that surrounded the launch area, and took some quick pictures. 
            This was all after about an hour of walking several miles from where 
            I parked, to the site, around the site twice, to the neighbors, to 
            the correct person's house, back around the site, and then finally, 
            in the site. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I didn't have a chance to 
    check out most of the buildings. There were bulls or cows in there, and they 
    were very curious. By the time I left, I thought we were all buddies, but 
    they did not agree. These things looked like they had the potential to destroy 
    me if they weren't so afraid of me... Sorry cows, and sorry mr. Farmer.</font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> When 
          I first arrived and walked around the base, I could see the launch doors 
          were open, but I couldn't see what was in them. This was begging me 
          to come see. Little did I know that after I nearly killed myself entering 
          that I'd find the base flooded with quite a bit of water. I'd say there 
          was maybe 10ft or more of water in there. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I walked around and 
          got some general pictures, then climbed the fences, ran to the launch 
          area, and snapped as many pictures as possible without wasting too much 
          time. For some reason trespassing seems less bad if you do it for less 
          time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The place was really 
          cool. I would have killed to go in had it not been full of water, but 
          it was cool none the less. The elevators are huge. </font></p></td>
    </tr>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">As with most of these remaining, the elevators 
    were broken. Two were submerged in the water and appeared to be 1/2 way elevated. 
    The doors were opened, but the elevators were about 1 foot below the edge 
    of the door in the open position... so about 3-4 foot down total. The final 
    elevator (the center one) was completely up. This as nice because it gave 
    an idea of what the other's would look like without all the water and slime 
    on them. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">If 
            you're completely lost so far, how about a quick background. The Nike 
            Missile was part of the Cold War. The sites were opened in the 1950s, 
            and most of them had closed by the 1960's. The sites consited of two 
            locations... an IFC, and the Launch Site. The IFC was the control, 
            radar, etc, and the Launch Site was where the missiles launched. This 
            was the Launch Site, although the IFC was nearby and is pictured below... 
            it is now a handicapped school with many original buildings. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The 
            Launch Site consisted of an undergound storage area for the missiles, 
            elevtors to bring them to the surface, and a launch area where the 
            missles were pushed to, then launched. There were also several support 
            buildings for the staff, assembly, and even dog runs for the security 
            dogs. Most of this remains at the Wilmington Site.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The Wilmington Site has 
    the designation of CD-27. You can find tons of specifics at <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/loc-o.html#Ohio">Ed's 
    site</a> or at the <a href="http://www.techbastard.com/missile/nike/index.php">Tech 
    Bastard's Site</a>. Neither are affiliated with my site in any way, so please 
    don't bother them if you own this place, hate my page, see bad info here, 
    etc. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The techbastard site describes 
    the launcher as follows... <em>&quot;At the launcher area, Nike missiles were 
    stored horizontally within heavily constructed underground missile magazines. 
    A large, missile elevator brought the Nikes to the surface of the site where 
    they would be pushed (manually) by crewmen, across twin steel rails to one 
    of four satellite launchers. The missile was then attached to its launcher 
    and erected to a near-vertical position for firing. The near-vertical firing 
    position ensured that the missile's booster rocket (lower stage) would not 
    crash directly back onto the missile site, but, instead, would land within 
    a predetermined booster impact area.&quot;</em></font></p>

          in the end, this was pretty cool even though I didn't get to go in the 
          storage area. I did manage to rip my pants on the fence, so let that 
          be a lesson to you would be trespassers... wear old jeans... or rather, 
          don't do it. Really, its best to avoid these places. Obviously they 
          are dangerous. Look at these pictures instead and imagine. </font></p>
