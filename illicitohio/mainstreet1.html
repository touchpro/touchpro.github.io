    some useless crap at the pawn shop when I decided to check out the status 
    of the Hartman building. I walked down the street to check it out, when I 
    spotted the block that formally housed the Ohio Furniture building</font>.

            a peak around some of the empty buildings and realized that I could 
            easily make my way right in to the buildings. There were no doors... 
            no windows... nothing to keep me from strolling right in, snapping 
            a few photos, and moving on. A few people saw me enter and leave and

          usage of each of the original buildings. I believe at one time, all 
          three were used for furniture sales. The layout of the building that 
          I spent most of my time in had been altered at some point. You could 
          clearly see that some windows and doors had been bricked over and some 
          false walls had been added between sections. Judging by some of the 
          colors used on the false walls, this place hadn't been used for quite 
          a while. Although the colors were rough, the interior was otherwise 
          in really good shape from what I could tell. </font></p></td>

            15 minutes inside because it was freezing cold that day. I managed 
            to get on the roof but was too much of a winp to check out the basement 
            on my own. The buildings were eventually finished and are now open
