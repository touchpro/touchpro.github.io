          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">I 
            decided to do a quick section on Youngstown as a whole. Youngstown 
            is a mid sized city that fell on hard times during the 1970s when 
            the local steel mills began to close. Youngstown was very healthy 
            leading up to that general time frame, but the city was based almost 
            entirely around that single industry. When mill work was shipped over 
            seas during the late 70's and early 80's, Youngstown suffered greatly. 
            The rust belt is made up of many cities like Youngstown that were 
            unfortunally left to die during the 1980s. Youngstown, in my opinion, 
            felt the impact more than most.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Its really tough to define 
    Youngstown because it is large, spread out, and made up of a bunch of suburbs, 
    some of which ended up doing alright. For the sake of keeping this section 
    reasonably sized I will be mostly covering downtown and the surrounding areas.

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">The 
          city has taken efforts to post original pictures of what some of the 
          stores looked like back in the day. You can see on in the distance on 
          the front of the store in the center of this picture.</font></p></td>
      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Up 
          until recently Youngstown's main street, Federal St, has been closed 
          off due to lack of business and high crime. When the jobs go away and 
          no new ones come in to replace them, people turn to other means to sustain. 
          This has been the case in Youngstown where often times the not widely 
          known city creeps in to the higher ranks of the annual murder rate per 
          capita list. I believe the city ended up with the top honors in 1997 
          but has dropped slowly ever since. Hopefully the opening and cleaning 
          up of federal is a promising sign.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So back to my trip... I've always had a 
    strange draw to the old Warner theater on Federal Street. Its one of many 
    abandoned buildings on the once booming main street through the city. Without 
    personally counting, I would estimate that about 65% of the shops and buildings 
    on the Street are completely abandoned or empty, and another 15% are being 
    used for some purpose completely other than their original (bars, pawn shops, 
    etc). The Warner theater is one of the larger buildings, and c'mon... what's 
    cooler than a big old theater with box seating, curtains, etc. Unfortunately 
    the theater was always pretty well closed up.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I had decided to get some pictures of the 
    downtown area on the way back from the trip to the turnpike hotel (featured 
    on this site). Youngstown was in between the hotel and my home town and I 
    hadn't scared myself enough snooping aruond an empty hotel in the middle of 
    nowhere. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I had already found one old completely 
    abandoned building on the way in to Youngstown, but I had unfortunately been 
    scared off by a bunch of rowdy and mean looking teenagers. In most places 
    you wouldn't worry about kids, but in Youngstown, you do.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">I arrived on Federal 
            St and was surprised to find it reopened. I took a few pictures of 
            the various other abandoned buildings close by, but I honestly stopped 
            feeling safe after a while. There was a seemingly crazy person ranting 
            and yelling, another man just watching my every move, and various 
            other shady acting people coming and going. I decided that it was 
            best if I just moved on, but not without checking the theater again 
            one more time.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">As luck would have it, or unluck would 
    have it, the theater was somewhat open for the first time. The dock area had 
    always been blocked with a large wooden wall and someone had finally pryed 
    the wood away. I could see the door on the dock was standing open. The opening 
    in the wood was very very narrow, but it looked like something I could squeeze 
    through. I didn't have a flashlight with me, so I left, went to a target store 
    in near by boardman ohio, and purchased a mag light, and returned. I then 
    realized that another close by door to the alley was open. I was going in.

          never been more aprehensive about entering an abandoned building. I 
          almost couldn't force myself to enter. It was clear that some of the 
          crazy people on Federal Street were living in these buildings, and they 
          really didn't seem like the harmless kind of crazy people. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Upon entering the 
          open door I realized I was in a stairwell. No way was I heading to the 
          basement, so I worked my way up to the highest floor... figuring homeless 
          people wouldn't bother going up that far. I entered the actual building 
          from a door in the stair well only to realize I was in the building 
          next to the theater. It was an old department store. I wasn't overly 
          familiar with it, but it was nice enough that it had elevators, mirrored 
          walls, nice wood work and sculpted ceilings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">It was pitch black 
          inside, so I tried my best to get a few pictures of the top floor and 
          visited the other floors with extreme caution, and exited. On the way 
          out I saw the most disturbing thing I've seen to date... a pair of womans 
          panties and a condom rapper were laying at my feet. Very nasty.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I eventually made it back 
    in to the department store during a desperate attempt to find an alternate 
    way in to the theater. I ended up on the roof of the store trying to drop 
    down on to a section of the theater. It was too far to jump and I was afraid 
    I wouldn't be able to get out once I was in. </font></p>

            the store and ending up on the roof, I had tied to fit through the 
            small opening I mentioned earlier, and I couldn't fit (I'm 6ft 1in 
            and about 175lbs). I kept getting trapped. I think part of it was 
            mental. I really did try, but there was a part of me that was glad 
            I couldn't fit once I looked back on it. It was clear that there was 
            someone entering and exiting regularly and as I'll once again point 
            out... You don't mess around with homeless and crazy people in Youngstown.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So that was my first disappointing trip 
    to the city. I didn't end up with much except exterior pictures, a few interiors 
    of one of the maybe 30 abandoned stores on the street, and a lot of hope for 
    a return trip with a few friends for back up.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">There will be more on Youngstown. I've 
    since been back to the area, but not the theater. There are a few abandoned 
    factories near by and a bunch of abandoned homes. Trying not to exagerate, 
    I'd estimate that its as high as 70% abandoned homes on some of the side streets 
    near wick park (about 3 minutes from downtown and once surrounded by very 
    large and expensive homes). Many of the homes are wide open. Almost all have 
    had the siding stolen as high up as you can reach because people sell it as 
    scrap. Nearly every turn brings you another abandoned school, mansion, store, 
    factory, home, or something. I really can't wait to get some more pictures 
    because it really is important that people see what happens to a city when 
    it loses its industry and no one steps in to help. Its easy to point fingers, 
    but you have to ask youself how no one was able to get the city turned around 
    again. I don't think there is any one factor, but instead countless variables 
    that either lead to recovery, or failure. </font></p>
