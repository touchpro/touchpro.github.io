          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Chippewa Lake Park 
            is a former trolly park (sort of) that opened in 1890ish and closed 
            in the late 1970's. The park was owned for most of its years by the 
            Beach family (namely parker) who maintained the park until its sale 
            in the 1960's. The park still stands to this day although much of 
            what was left has rotted or suffered from the boredom of local teens 
            and the like. I've made several trips to the park over the years and 
            have sadly witnessed the loss of a few of the remains that were there 
            even on my initial visits. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The most notable recent loss on the grounds 
    was the former ballroom. The remains of the midway have also collapsed and 
    the cars from the swining gyms are no longer on the ride. The most recent 
    thing that I noticed was the collapse of the bathhouse floor.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">The 
          old flying cage cars. The actual Red, green, blue, and yellow cars are 
          now missing from the structure. I believe a local has taken them to 
          protect them.</font></p></td>
      <td width="56%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The actual cause of 
          the closing is cause for much debate. I believe ultimately you can simply 
          mark this one under the low attendance column. The park was bought out 
          by Continental Business Enterprises in the late 1960's and really didn't 
          make it too far beyond that. Attendance dwindled and the company's big 
          plans for the park never materialzed. They closed the park at the end 
          of the 1978 season and it never officially reopened. I have heard that 
          the company that bought the park had planned on offering gambling on 
          the grounds and when they were not approved, they closed the park. I 
          don't know if that is correct.</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">It is often discussed how the park was 
    simply walked away from, but the actually that isn't the case. Much of what 
    remained at closing time was auctioned off. Most of what remains now were 
    the rides that were either too difficult to move, or not worth the money to 
    move at the time. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The park is really 
            amazing to visit during the summer. It really has a feel of an amusement 
            park. There are signs of the park pretty much everywhere you turn. 
            One of the more amazing things to see in real life is the Ferris Wheel 
            pictured to the right which has been overtaken by nature. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The coaster standing 
            inside the entrance gate gets me more emails from hopeful park fans 
            than anything else on my site. The pictures don't accurately reflect 
            the poor condition. Unfortunately the reality is that the coaster 
            is probably beyond repair. Almost all of the wood has rotted, trees 
            have fallen through the structure, and the coaster is sitting a good 
            portion of the year in a swamp. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">There is still plenty to see on the grounds. 
    I plan to keep occasionally checking up on the status, so I'll try to keep 
    the pages here somewhat updated. Prior to the Heritage USA section of my site, 
    Chippewa Lake was easily the most visited section of my site and still holds 
    a close second place to Heritage (which is much larger and was visited by 
    millions). This park is really special for a lot of people who spent their 
    teen years attending dances in the ballroom or even working on the grounds.</font></p>

          taking care of the site, so it's not always a simple walk in affair. 
          I've never run in to anyone on the grounds, but I have received emails 
          from folks who have. A simple walk around the grounds will show that 
          the paths to fire hyrdants remain cleared and the fence is often mended 
          after people cut it to enter. The owners do not offer tours of any kind. 
          I know of many people that have tried and it simply doesn't happen.</font></p></td>
