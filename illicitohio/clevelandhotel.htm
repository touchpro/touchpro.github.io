    surprise. As of this writing, I know nothing at all about the place. I was 
    looking for the <a href="coastguard.htm">Whiskey Island Coast Guard Station</a> 
    and happened to find this place while lost. Being dedicated to offering you 
    the best of I can find, I couldn't resist. </font></p>

            all of which were booming on a monday afternoon. I had trouble finding 
            a smooth entrance, but I was able to get in eventually... after climbing 
            through poision ivy. </font></p>

            what I can tell, this was once the Lakefront Plaza Hotel. I found 
            a phone number for the hotel on line and it now goes to some guy, 
            so don't try to reserve a room. He doesn't have any. </font></p>

          to have been abandoned for quite a while now. If I had to guess, I'd 
          say it was in poor condition up through the 90s. It appears to have 
          been under renovation when it closed. It reminded me of the tower at 
          heritage in that the lower floors were closer to being done than the 
          upper floors. None of the floors that I visited actually looked like 
          hotel rooms. All were just walls and doors with some plumbing. There 
          may have been finished rooms, but I didn't visit all of the floors due 
          to time, heat, and heat, and more heat. </font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The coolest part of this place was the 
    old lobby and lounge area. There was more outdated porn on the floor of this 
    place than time square in the 80s. It was a bit gross to say the least. </font></p>

            way for renovation. There had been some demolition, but for the most 
            part, it still looked somewhat like a hotel and lounge. </font></p>

            started to get a little creeped out here because I was somewhat trapped 
            in to a corner, but at the same time, it was the one place where I 
            could see the only possible entrance. For whatever reason, I constantly

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">I eventually ventured upward. 
    On my way up I had the biggest scare I've had to date. Lets be honest, we 
    all occasionally get a little creeped out if we have to walk through our dark 
    basement, or out near the woods at night. This was exactly how I was feeling 
    going up the steps. I just felt like someone was there. I never heard so much 
    as a sound. As I crest the final set of steps leading to the top floor, I 
    hear a scuffle... I'm not talking a quick sound, but a full on scuffle and 
    it was coming toward me quickly from the steps above. I took about one step 
    backward, and for whatever reason, my brain decided to stay and fight. I yanked 
    my maglight up and put on my meanest face. I'm sure the pidgeon was scared 
    as he flew away. I thought for sure it was a person. I've had the typical 
    bird scare before, but this one was really involved. I have no idea what the 
    bird was doing to make that much noise or why he came toward me first, but 
    he did. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">That was about the end 
    of my trip. I spent the next ten minutes or so calming down and enjoying the 
    amazing view from the penthouse area... I calmed myself a little and headed 
    off to find the <a href="coastguard.htm">lighthouse</a> I was originally looking 
    for. </font></p>
