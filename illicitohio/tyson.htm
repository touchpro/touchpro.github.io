  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">While website over the 
    past 10 years or so, I have never once struggled so much with the decision 
    of whether or not to post pictures of one of my trips like I did with this 
    one. I came extremely close to not posting these, or at the very least delaying 
    the posting. The reason being, this place is very easy to find, in good condition, 
    and unfortunately very ripe for some idiot going through it and stealing stuff 
    and/or vandalizing it. I have the feeling the idiots will find it either way, 
    but I really don't want to aid them. In the end, I decided to stay dedicated 
    to those who continue to come here for new material. I doubt that my posts 
  will make any difference in the longevity of the former Mike Tyson home. </font></p>

            with that said, what are you seeing here. What you are seeing is the 
            former home of Boxer Mike Tyson. Tyson has not owned the home since 
            the late 1990s. Back when I visited, the home was owned by a business man name 
            Paul Monea... actually, it was owned by the Monea Family Trust, and currently, 
            it may or may not be in the posession of law enforcement because it 
            is, or was, at the center of an investigation involving Mr. Monea.

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Paul Monea was a business 
    man who once made some money selling TaeBo workout tapes featuring none other 
    than Billy Blanks... remember that craze? Paul Monea was the mastermind behind 
    it, and it made him quite a bit of cash from what I understand. One of his 
    purchases was the former home of Mike Tyson in 1999 for the price of 1.3 million. 
    Tyson had since moved to Vegas and the home was For Sale. Monea didn't buy 
    it because he needed a home... he already had a much nicer home. I suppose 
    it was to be an investment property? Regardless, from what I understand he 
    never lived in the home. There was a period of time in 2005 when it was for 
    sale on Ebay, but the home didn't sell. </font></p>

      <td width="51%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Fast forward to 2006 
          or so, and Paul had come up with another plan. Now I hate to take sides, 
          but in my opinion the guy got a raw deal here. Paul had a diamond. A 
          really really big one. So big that it had its own website. It was a 
          40 Carat Diamond... yes you're reading that correctly... 40 Carat. HUGE! 
          So Paul decides he's going to sell both the Diamond and the property. 
          Unfortunately the buyer was an FBI agent working undercover. What's 
          the problem with that you may be asking... well at some point the buyer 
          (aka agent) decides to inform Paul that he will be buying the home with 
          Drug money. According to reports Paul advised the agent that he didn't 
          want to know where the money was coming from and even feigned a hearing 
          problem saying something to the effect of &quot;A RUG dealer?&quot;.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">I don't know much about the law... obviously, 
    but it seems like that isn't something you should go to prison for. If I put 
    a car on craigslist and the guy that comes by to purchase it says he's a drug 
    dealer, is it really my responsibility to say nevermind? I guess so. If this 
    is the sort of thing that the FBI is doing though, why aren't they on craigslist 
    all day baiting sellers in to selling them things for drug money? I guess 
    I'm failing to see how this sort of thing benefits society unless Paul Monea 
    was going out trying to find drug dealers to sell things to and encouraging 
    people to sell drugs to buy his stuff. I'm off topic. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">So back to the house. 
            In the end, Paul was busted, and it appears that now the home may 
            be in the hands of the authorities along with the Diamond. The story 
            is actually much more confusing than what I'm telling here, but this 
            is a good enough overview. The important part is that some time during 
            all of this, the house became abandoned. How abandoned? Well, the 
            doors are wide open, there is no power, the lawn hasn't been mowed, 
            and no one seemed to question me walking around it, including a Cop 
            who I'm fairly certian saw me leaving and didn't seem to mind. As 
            with all of my trips, I was careful, didn't touch a thing, and even 
            wiped my feet... seriously, I'm that dumb.</font></p>

    people will steal the pictures and post them everywhere. I also suspect that 
    you'll see other people featuring this on their sites very soon with their 
    own pictures, but I can tell you that as far as I could tell, after searching 
    far and wide, these are the only pictures on the net of the inside of this

            you see here are actually the product of two separate trips. I took 
            trip one without a tripod and quickly realized that the place was 
            too dim to photograph without a flash or tripod. I took flash photos, 
            and they sucked. I went out, bought a tripod, and it made a huge difference. 
            I'd never used one before, and I'll never go without one now. Most 
            of the pictures are from trip two. Both trips were snowing, so it 
            was easy to tell that no one had been in or out of the home recently. 
            The first was very windy and I eventually got too spooked to go through 
            everything. On trip two, I got the nerve to explore a little more.

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Like with any of my trips, 
    I had a few disasters. People seem to enjoy my misfortune, so let me just 
    knock the three major ones out for your amusement right now. First of all, 
    when I walked in to the master bedroom and started taking pictures, an old 
    smoke detector that was laying on the bed suddenly went off. I'm assuming 
    my body heat or something confused it, but it scared the absolute hell out 
    of me. Picture being alone in this house on high alert, and hearing that. 
    I freaked. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Disaster two was on my 
    way back to the car. It was snowing, and the ground was completely covered. 
    I decided to take a path through the woods. Suddenly I see a guy running a 
    piece of heavy machinery at the end of the path, so I take a detour just to 
    avoid being in his way. I walk directly in to a swamp and instantly feel ice 
    cold water creep through my shoes and pants and doubled up socks. I'm about 
    3/4 mile from my car at that point. I went back to the Tyson property and 
    just walked out the main gate and to the main road and jogged to my car with 
    heavy wet cold feet. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Disaster three was minor... 
    on the way to the house a lady swerved to avoid me (even though I was completely 
    off the road in the grass next to the road) and managed to hit the slush that 
    had built up in the road from the snow launching a huge wave of slush all 
    over me, the camera, etc... and I mean AT LOT of slush. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">With that out of the way, enjoy the following 
    pictures. Please don't go vandalize this place or steal stuff from this place

          check the plants in the pictures. At first I assumed they were fake, 
          but as my mother pointed out, the leaves are falling off and they appear 
          to be dying. How long could this place have been abandoned? Also notice 
          that the pool doesn't look bad. Keep in mind that Monea never lived 
          here and has owned it since 1999. Also keep in mind that upon my visit 
          it was standing wide open with no heat, electric, etc and the grass 
          hadn't been mowed in some time. The outdoor plants are overgrown. All 
          signs point to long term abandonedment except the lack of broken and 
          stolen stuff, the plants, and the somewhat clear chlorine smelling pool 
          water.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So what will you see in the following pictures? 
    Well the house had one master bedroom, with fireplace, walk in closet, attached 
    huge bathroom with sunken tub overlooking the back yard, double sinks, etc. 
    Four additional bedrooms with attached baths. An 8 car garage. An enourmous 
    TV room with tiger striped carpet. A huge pool with all kinds of extras. A 
    nice patio. A basket ball court with a Tyson logo on the surface and bleachers. 
    Tiger cages for Mike's pet Tigers. A dining room with a faux gold ceiling. 
    TVs, stereo equipment, etc... all kinds of cool stuff. There are three pages
