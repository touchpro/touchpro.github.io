            in the middle of our prime 'exploring' years, Andy and I were invited 
            to a story with News Channel 10's Scott Varner. I can't remember the 
            specifics now, but the story never aired. Andy recalled a certain 
            Cuban boy's stay in Miami as being the story that bumped ours, but 
            a young boy being nabbed by the government in a swat attack could 
            not possibly be more important than a story about kids walking through 
            old buildings, could it? The world may never know. Actually... we 
            do know. The story never ran.</font></p>

    know is if we get our second chance at having our 15 minutes of fame. Channel 
    4 came to the rescue by inviting Andy and Me to do a story. By now Andy had 
    created probably a good 30 minutes of fame on his own, but this would be the 
    first time since the 1990's that we appeared in a feature length news story 
    together in leading roles... and this one was Oscar material. </font></p>

          City prison is a really cool location. Its out in the middle of nowhere, 
          so you have the creepyness factor. The building has a cool history, 
          first as a prison, then as the setting of a Robert Redford movie, next 
          as a pizza factory, and most recently as the backdrop of a news story 
          about abandoned buildings.</font></p></td>

    detials. We basically just walked around, snapped photos, almost fell through 
    ice in the flooded basement, and chatted about what we do and why we do it. 
    Of course I sounded like the biggest dork in the universe, but it was fun.

            to buildings for over 10 years. I was glad I told my mother to watch. 
            I'm sure nothing warms a mother's heart like hearing her son's name 
            on the news in the context of breaking and entering. Oh well. Over 
            all the news team did a great job with the piece and had really kind
