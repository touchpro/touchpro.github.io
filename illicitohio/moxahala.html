    gave me a heads up. I had no idea the park even existed. I don't know how 
    it never came up seeing as how my other site covers Amusement Parks entirely, 
    and this one is in my own home state... Regardless, a huge thanks goes out 
    to the reader.</font></p>

            the park two times. Much of what was there on the inital trip is now 
            gone. I had actually received word that it was entirely gone, but 
            a recent visit proved otherwise. The land is still partially used 
            by the Nolan family for their Carnival business. According to another 
            reader the family operated amusement rides on the grounds for a while 
            as an amusement park. </font></p>

          auction, but I do have a flier from the auction from which I hope to 
          eventualy grab a few pictures.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The really memorable thing about this trip 
    was that I had just watched the movie the Ring which is focused around a creepy 
    girl in an old well in the middle of nowhere who had been thrown in the well 
    by her parents... who owned a horse farm and had raised her in their barn. 
    As luck would have it, within minutes of being at the park I stumbled first 
    across a shed full of fiberglass horses from a childrens ride, and then a 
    large stone wishing well in the center of the property. Not cool.</font></p>

            but have since been mostly destroyed. Even with those buildings standing, 
            the rest of the park was pretty much just a field. There really wasn't 
            much to tell you how the park was layed out. Having sold their only 
            coaster it is no surprise that the park didn't make it to the present.</font></p>
