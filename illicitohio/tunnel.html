            in a campus building that happened to have a door leading in to the 
            campus tunnels. This was way way back before the days of terrorism 
            and homeland security, so the tunnels were sometimes left unlocked. 
            We made several trips around campus in the tunnels over the years. 
            The Univeristy frowns on people going in the tunnels because there 
            are power lines, steam pipes, and water lines everwhere. I managed 
            to get burnt, scraped, cut, etc quite a few times. I never did get 
            many pictures, but here are two that I did get...</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">There really isn't much 
    to say about the tunnels. There were roaches down there that were big enough 
    to walk on a leash. The coolest thing about being down there was that you 
    could hear people through the various vents above your head. If you're walking 
    con campus and see a series of 14&quot; vents, you're above the tunnels. Most 
    run a very similar path to the sidewalks. Look down and you may see an idiot 
    snooping around down there.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">By the time I had graduated 
    I knew most of the tunnels well enough to get around. I don't remember them 
    now, so I won't be able to help you at all if you're trying to figure them 
    out. I'd highly recommend not going down there if you're attending OSU because 
    I believe they kill you if they catch you... or maybe they expel you, but 
    the punishment is really over the top from what I hear.</font></p>
