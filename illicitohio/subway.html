  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Although much of the content of this Site 
    is focused on Columbus, the actual intent is to cover all of Ohio, or at least 
    as much as possible. Given that fact, it was impossible to resist the Cincinnati 
    abandoned Subway tunnels. Of course, as with all of our explorations, we did 
    screw this up a little. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Before we get to the pictures and discriptions, 
    the background is that Cincinatti started to build a full subway system in 
    the 20's. The project started and stopped numerous times before finally being 
    put to rest in the 50s. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Many of these pictures 
            are really bad because of the lack of light in the tunnels. This tunnel 
            had a little more light than the 2nd tunnel we verntured in to. This 
            tunnel was cut off during the making of I-75. Unfortunately we didn't 
            realize this until we were already in there and had spent quite a 
            bit of time getting in there. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">There are two tunnels that are a few hundred 
    yards apart. The train would have exited one, traveled in the outside, and 
    then entered the 2nd set which face it. We didn't know which set went the 
    farthest, so we entered the first one we came to. It ended up being the short 
    one that was blocked about 100 yards later by a cement wall. </font></p>

          mistake out, we managed to get to the right tunnel and we were able 
          to go right in by climbing the gate. The 2nd set was much more impressive. 
          We never did reach the end, but it went way back under the city. I would 
          estimate that we went somewhere between one and two miles, but I could 
          be way off. We walked for a really really long time. I believe we were 
          in tunnels for more than an hour and maybe closer to two. I was worn 
          out by the time we left. </font></p></td>

            so my memory is vague, but I believe we ended up seeing three stations 
            total. One was entirely bocked over if I recall correctly. Another 
            was very plain and simple for the most part, and the third was the 
            famous bomb shelter station. It appeared that it would have been one 
            of the main stations with ticket booths and what not. It had later 
            been converted to a bomb shelter for important people in the city.

    part. There were bunk beds, walls, food storage containors, and all kinds 
    of cools stuff down there. The shelter was one of the few points that still 
    had a usable opening to the world above. It was secured well, but there were 
    large steel gates that opened to the sidewalks above.</font></p>

            one of the tunnels had been converte to run a huge waterline through 
            the city. We tried walking on top of it because some of the tunnels 
            were flooded with rain water, but the pipe was covered in slippery
