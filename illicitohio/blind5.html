    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>The writing was on the wall! The very 
      upper rooms, right before the roof, held all kinds of great graphiti from 
      as far back as the 1890s. I don't mean great as in good pictures, but 
      great because of their age, I mean c'mon, let's remember where we are 
      here! </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>The writing to the left is a message 
      from the people who are remodeling the bottom floors as we speak (or 
      actually, as you read). The message states that the upper floors will 
      remain untouched. This made me happy to think that all of this would stay 
      for years to come! YEAAAAH! </FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>I do believe that the writing is as old 
      as it suggests. The walls were just plaster, and hadn't been painted. The 
      names all sounded old, and there were dates ranging from the 1890s to now. 
      It all looked authentic, so if you did it about 1 week before we went in, 
      good work! These two pictures are hard to see, but the writing was old 
      looking. Kids were dirty little bastards back then.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>You are reading that picture to the 
      right correctly. That says, "Public Safety Hall of Fame". That would be an 
      interesting one to see. Unfortunately all of the pictures were taken down. 
      This is obvoiusly from the Highway Patroll days. This hallway was right 
      inside the main entrance. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>This is a light in one of the offices in 
      the new section. I'm guessing this office belonged to someone important 
      because it was much nicer than the others that we came across. The windows 
      in these rooms were left open for some reason. It didn't really smell bad. 
      Maybe they're removing asbestos.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>Check out those floors and fireplace. 
      I'm proud to say that I helped pay for that with all of those speeding 
      tickets that I've gotten. I'm glad to see it goes to something good like 
      hardwood floors instead of say ROADS! Oh well, it was cool for us to see 
      in the end. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>This is a picture from the crazy 
      basement. The basement had all of these strange pathways leading all over 
      it. The first time we were there we saw doorways at each end. The second 
      time, somone had kicked one of them in. It wasn't us for the record. The 
      last time I road by the School there was a sign that said "KEEP OUT, This 
      means you!" on the door. I guess they know we were there. Well, that's it 
      for now. Stay tuned for more! </FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR><A
