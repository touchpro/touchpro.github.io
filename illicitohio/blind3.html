    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>There were cool ass stair cases 
      everywhere in the Blind School. The upper floors had been blocked off 
      during the time that the Highway Patroll occupied the building. There was 
      even a note that said you could only access the top floors with 
      permission. We couldn't find anyone to ask. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>The stairs to the left are from the 
      highway patrol days, all of the other stairs pictured come from the days 
      of the Blind School. Its interesting to think of why they would put steep 
      narrow stair cases in a school for blind people. Its even more interesting 
      to think what it must have looked like at lunch time.

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>The stairs to the right were very very 
      narrow. This one of my favorite stair cases to date. The ere small, 
      narrow, and had a bend, what more could you want? They led to this strange 
      hot and smelly room where "charles" and I are guessing the old towers were 
      attached before they were taken down. I'm guessing the stairs took you to 
      the room, then on to the towers. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>Here is that room. It was very hot, and 
      smelled like warm wood. I'm guessing it burst in to flames about 2 seconds 
      after we left, because it felt like it was going to then. One had this 
      fireplace with some writing on the wall behind it. The other was a bare 
      room (there were 2 narrow stairs, each with a small room at the top). The 
      roof was peaked because at this point you are in the attic. .

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>This is the coveted Elevator Room. I 
      feel that a building hasn't been explored unless you run across the 
      elevator room at some point. If the building doesn't have elvators, then 
      you can skip looking for the elevator room. I think the most recent date 
      on the inspection was 1992. This is around the time the the OSHP quit 
      using it. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=4><FONT color=gray>I put these pictures together because 
      they are taken upright. I don't know why I do that because it always 
      screws up the website layout. On the left is one of the doors added by the 
      Highway Patroll I'm guessing. It requires keycard access. On the right is 
      the elevator doors as seen on the 3rd floor.
