  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">This particular voyage takes me outside 
    of the great state of Ohio and in to our neighbor Pennsylvania for an up close 
    look at an abandoned steel mill. This isn't just any old decaying mill to 
    me. The Babcocks and Wilcox Wallace Run building was a home away from home 
    for my father and many others like him during an age when the American Steel 
    industry boomed. </font></p>

            mill in those days would be like finding an empty Software company 
            headquarters now. Today, mills all across the rust belt are slowly 
            and sadly decaying in to their landscapes. They provide memories of 
            a time when a man or woman provided for their family by means of physical 
            labor in extreme conditions. The heat, noise, and danger are unlike 
            nearly anything we currently have in this country.</font></p>

  <p> <font size="4" face="Courier New">Eventually the time came when many factors 
    contributed to the demise of the mill. To avoid touching on the politics of 
    the United States, let it simply be said that business went away to foreign 
    lands. With the business went jobs. Lax government regulations made it more 
    economical for mills to lay off their employees and have steel shipped across 
    the ocean from mills where workers made very little.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">Inside 
          the main mill area. It is mostly empty now. Notice the large vents in 
          the wall. My father explained that the guys used to hang out of the 
          vents just to get some cool air... even on a 90 degree day the air outside 
          felt cool compared to the temps inside.</font></p></td>

          One could spend much time discussing what was or wasn't done to help 
          the American Steel worker, but I only have so much free space here and 
          politics only piss people off. I suggest watching Roger and Me (Michael 
          Moore) to get a feel for the emotion that came with the demise of the 
          industry. Many people get heated at seeing the name Michael Moore, but 
          the movie really does do a good job of capturing the emotion of those 
          times. I lived much of it myself as the child of someone that worked 
          in this mill and I remember the shock, worry, desperation, etc of the 
          end of the industrial boom. </font></p></td>

  <p> <font size="4" face="Courier New">With all of that said, try to appreciate 
    what went on in this mill just a short time ago. Hundreds of men and women 
    worked day and night to produce what was then the heart of America, US Steel. 
    The furnaces that once lit up the night have been removed. The roar that filled 
    the air is gone. Many of the workers have moved on with their lives, but none 
    will forget the days they spent in the mill.</font></p>

          for anyone who didn't personally experience the 1980s in the rustbelt 
          to fully understand how quickly and unexpectedly everything changed. 
          Many families were able to recover to some extent, but things were never 
          the same. It was the end of an era. Driving through any of the small 
          towns around the mills will show you how horribly depressed they are 
          to this day. There simply wasn't a back up plan because ultimately no 
          one ever expected the mills to go away. Even during the dying days it 
          seemed that everyone just trusted that everything would work out for 
          the best. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">These days we're used to the idea 
          that we may change jobs 10 times during our life, but workers in these 
          mills fully expected to retire from the mills and to live a modest life 
          just like many generations before them had done. Within a period of 
          about 4 years the way things had always been were gone.</font></p></td>
