          was built in the early 1900s and was used as a hotel up in to the 1980s 
          I believe. The EPA used the building more recently for a headquarters 
          and it was completely abandoned in the 1990s. By the time we visited 
          it was clear that it was a tops spot to for homeless people to sleep. 
          This was one of the few buildings were we actually ran in to a homeless 
          person inside. Actually we didn't see him, but we heard the distinct 
          sound of him smoking crack right around the corner. We left.</font></p>

          to the damage of being abandoned the building had all the signs of a 
          place that had been renovated during the 1980s. Drop ceilings hung below 
          neglected nice ceilings in the lobby. Nice wood trim had been covered 
          in white paint. Cheap paneling had been used to cover nice walls. False 
          walls had been built to section off areas that once flowed nicely. Its 
          really a shame.</font></p></td>

            old buildings are dead birds. They get in through an open window and 
            then can't get out. The seneca had more than its fair share. A few 
            times I actually heard bones crack as I stepped on something soft. 
            Gross. Outside of the crack smoker and the dead birds, signs of life 
            in most of the building were minimal. There was working electric in 
            the basement, but the rest of the building was just plain empty.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">One of the stranger things in the hotel 
    was the lobby. There was a section where you could walk down a hallway, and 
    go through a wooden panel that left you on a balcony that surrounded the lobby. 
    The strange part was that you were above a drop ceiling that had been installed.

        memory is vague on the other details since its been a good 6 years or 
        more since I was here. I remember a room full of rental property stuff 
        leading me to assume the building was owned by a rental company. There 
        was also a huge freight elevator that made no sense to have in a hotel. 
        There was what appeared to be an old computer room or something... I really 
        couldn't quiet figure it out.</font></p>
        
      <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">I'd love to know the 
        details of the computer room looking thing if you happen to have any info. 
        It looked like it had been used as a computer room or possibly telco room 
        in the 1970s. There was power run everywhere through this area and signs 
        of either racks or work stations, and the tacky orange plastic walls just 
        had that late 1970s feel that you really don't miss. </font></p></td>

  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">That was about it for the 
    upper rooms. The actual hotel rooms were really tiny and had really gross 
    bathrooms. They reminded me of a hotel you'd see in downtown New York where 
    the rooms are still small like they were in the 1920s. There were a few board 
    rooms through out.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">The basement was another 
            strange area. There was quite a bit of electrical rig in the basement 
            and there was still power to a single light. There was also a room 
            filled with legal papers, probably belonging to the epa. If I had 
            had a bunch more time to search I could have looked for the file of 
            the Industrial Waste superfund site also featured here... but I didn't. 
            We did see a room full of toilets and sinks which made up for it.</font></p>
