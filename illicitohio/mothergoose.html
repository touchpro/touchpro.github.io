          was a trip to Mother Goose Land in Canton Ohio. It was a public park 
          for Children that was inspired by the Pittsburgh Zoo. My understanding 
          is that it was fronted mostly by the Jaycees. The park was built in 
          the 1950s. I can't seem to find an exact closing date. From all appearances, 
          it had been quite a while. I want to say it was in the 1980s, but I'm 
          not really sure about that. The park was basically a children's park 
          that featured story book themed attractions and sculptures. It wasn't 
          really an amusement park so much as just a park... with a theme.</font></div></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The only major thing at 
    the site that still remains is the big blue whale. You actually may find yourself 
    feeling bad for him when you're there. According to what I've read, he was 
    once the entrance to an aquarium. Going by the size, it wasn't a very large 
    aquarium. There was a noha's ark exhibit that had animals... apparently that 
    was somehow connected to the creek that runs along the side of the park. Per 
    <a href="http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=426165" target="_blank">THIS</a> 
    article in the Canton Rep <em>&quot;There was Ali Baba's Cave and the Three 
    Bears' House,&quot; Guist recalled. &quot;We had a little red schoolhouse 
    and Noah's Ark.&quot; </em>Also mentioned in that article, some of the attractions... 
    <em>&quot;The Cheese House. The Old Lady and Her Shoe. The Crooked House That 
    Jack Built. The Pumpkin House. The Old Mill. One by one, the exhibits took 
    form. Then a multitude of animals took up residence in the park, so they could 
    excite children for years.&quot;</em></font></p>

      <td width="50%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Now 
          the park is divided in two by a fence. One side has a pavilion and some 
          horseshoe pits. There were actually people arriving to play horseshoes 
          at the same time as me... they were confused by me and staring. The 
          paths that used to run through the park now have a fence right through 
          them. Surprisingly the park is still maintained. The grass was mowed 
          (and the infield raked?) Other than the whale and the entrance building, 
          a few paths, some footers, and a foundation or two, nothing else remains 
          of Mother Goose Land except memories in the minds of Cantonians. </font></p></td>

    the entrance, pictured at the top of this article, and also below, was made
