  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">This was the place that 
    finally got me off of my ass and inspired me to do a long overdo update. Its 
    the famed Faymore's Castle, aka: Treasure Palace, near Eaton Ohio. My new 
    girlfriend and I made the trip out to see it in late August, and after some 
    searching, we found it. We actually found the entrance right away, but didn't 
    know that's what we were looking at, so we made the trek through the woods, 
    a stream, a stream again, and more woods, finally ending up at the Castle.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">While 
            I was able to find some other mentions of this place on line, and 
            some theories as to its origins, it was tough to find anything factual. 
            As it ends up, the castle was built by Dr. Leonard Faymore, and his 
            common law wife Dorris. The castle was about 1/3rd of the way completed 
            at the time that the Doctor was convicted on drug charges for selling 
            illegal prescriptions, or so the government said. He was put in prison 
            in Wisconsin in 1982 and the construction stopped. The castle sat 
            empty waiting for a buyer that unfortunately never came along. The 
            money was to be used for an appeal to the doctors conviction. </font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">This 
          is the interior of the castle. The lower rooms would have been the basement 
          with the upper floors being supported by the walls you see here. </font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Eventually the doctor was 
    released from prison, but unfortunately died not long after. The castle has 
    sat without a king and queen since the 1980's, and now shows significant wear.

        <p align="center"><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Courier New">This 
          is an exterior view of a section that had partially collapsed.</font></p></td>
      <td width="49%"><p><font size="4" face="Courier New">The castle had quite 
          a grand plan behind it. The plans, which were apparently originally 
          drawn up on a roll of paper towels, were quite ambitious. With little 
          or no professional design advice, the couple planned a 90 by 35 foot 
          bedroom. That's bigger than my entire first home, in fact, its more 
          than twice the size of my first home. In addition there were plans for 
          six additional bed rooms, a game room, countless fireplaces, a 14 foot 
          deep swimming pool (which seems closer to 8 ft to me), a 45 foot tall 
          draw bridge, and a tunnel leading to the wine cellar and Jacuzzi. The 
          walls were 50 foot tall. This place is big! </font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Before much of that could be completed, 
    the doctor was busted by undercover cops, and put in prison. According to 
    reports, the doctor was running a well known clinic that sold drugs... legal 
    drugs, but sold illegally. People would come from all over the country to 
    get what they needed. Reports indicate that there would be lines so long that 
    everyone would be given a number, then certain number ranges would be told 
    to go away and return hours later. So let that be a lesson to you... there's 
    money in drugs. Wait. Scratch that. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Courier New">Possibly the most 
            interesting thing about the castle is the rumors which followed after 
            the Doctor was put away. Supposedly the walls contain the treasure... 
            money, stashed by the doctor, to the tune of various millions. Its 
            also rumored that the walls contain jewlry, and bodies... I have no 
            idea why bodies, but it sounds freaky. The walls don't seem big enough 
            for bodies, and I'd imagine if the money was there, the common law 
            wife would have taken it for the appeal. Certainly she wouldn't have 
            been selling the place for a mere $300,000 in 1985... which is exactly 
            what she was trying to do.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">So there you have it... a failed attempt 
    at cashing in on some illegal activity. Next time you drive through a fancy 
    neighborhood, its safe to assume that most of those people are criminals that 
    simply didn't get caught. Probably not actually, but give them nasty looks 
    just in case.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Courier New">Our 
            trip was relatively uneventful. It was a nice day and we had a great 
            time checking the place out and spending some time together. Its worth 
            noting that the pool has been emptied, and it frequented now by skaters 
            and freestyle bike people. We ran in to a couple of guys that didn't 
            know what to make of us, and a few more were coming in as we were 
            leaving. I've since seen pictures of the pool filled with nasty water 
            from as little as a few years ago, so these skaters deserve to be 
            able to use this place based on the sheer amount of work they must 
            have put in to draining that sucker. </font></p>
