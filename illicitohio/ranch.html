    I decided to go see what was left of the old Ranch. I hadn't spent much time 
    there as a teen because it was pretty much closed down by the time I would 
    have visited. It did reopen a few times off and on over the years, but it 
    was never really very busy.</font></p>

          collapsed over the bowling alleys by the time I got there. I was able 
          to get in to the basement, but it was raining through the building and 
          in to the basement. That's a bad sign. There was a bowling ball down 
          there. I never take stuff from these buildings, but I almost made an 
          exception in this case. There was a bulldozer next to the building. 
          The building was collapsed. It was obvious that they were about to the 
          knock it down, but I still decided to stick to my own rules an not take 
          anything.</font></p></td>
