  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So once I got a taste of 
    the whole Nike site thing by visiting <a href="wilmingtonnike.html" target="_blank">Wilmington</a>, 
    I couldn't get enough. I go in phases like this. I get something in my head, 
    then I focus on it until I've completely run it in to the ground. Anyway, 
    I decided to check out a few more of the former Nike sites, and I was pleased 
    with what I found. I spent a chilly October day driving around the Pittsburgh 
    area and it ended up paying off. I visited four former sites that day. This 
    was the first. <a href="elramanike.html" target="_blank">Elrama</a> was the 
    second. <a href="herminienike.html" target="_blank">Herminie</a> was the thrid, 
    and <a href="irwinnike.html" target="_blank">Irwin</a> was the final.</font></p>

          expectations were somewhat low for the first site, but it was the closest. 
          My concerns proved true for the former launch site, but there were some 
          cool remains at the former IFC. To bring you up to speed if you nothing 
          about the Nike program, basically Nike bases consisted of two separate 
          locations. The Launch Site which has the missile storage, launch area, 
          etc, and the IFC, which is the control, radar, etc. They were sometimes 
          a mile or so apart, and sometimes a little closer. In this case, they 
          were now very far apart in terms of driving, thanks to a highway that 
          had been since built between them. </font></div></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The Launch site had been 
    bulldozed. All that remained was a large cement pad, some foundations, and 
    some grates in the ground that likely went to the drainage system and nothing 
    more. Some of the housing outside the base appeared to possibly have been 
    military housing originally. Other than that, no much remained. The site was 
    100% unused and now serves as a nature preserve. </font></p>

          for the IFC, the site is now being used by the City crew or state road 
          crew or something of that nature. I was supprised to see the radar foundations 
          still standing. They must have been relatively well built because no 
          one has bothered to tear them down. They appear to be using one of them 
          as a storage shed. The buildings are all correct for an IFC as well 
          with the communications building apparently being used for storage. 
          Surprisingly no one seemed to question why I was here taking picutres 
          of their buildings. I assume they know what the buildings were once 
          used for and don't mind people coming by to appreciate some local history.</font></p></td>

  <p><font size="4" face="Courier New">Speaking of history, back to that. The 
    Nike program was a missile defense program from the 1950ish time frame. Basically 
    it was air defense. If those dirty commies decided to send planes to attack 
    the US, the Nike Missles served the purpose of taking them out. The idea was 
    to fire the missile in to the center of an airplane formation, and the blast 
    would take the planes out. There were a few different types of missile over 
    the years... more on that later. The batteries were at the launch site, and 
    were basically underground bunker type buildings that held six missiles. They 
    had an elevator that took the missiles to the surface where they were then 
    able to be launched. There was a system of tracks that the missiles were moved 
    on and launched from. Here are two examples that I found on the web...</font></p>

          track that the missiles could then be pushed to. In the front of the 
          photo closest to you milliles on a track already. Most launch sites 
          had several batteries, which means several tracks, elevators, etc. Notice 
          the doors to the undergroun open in the picture. They are on the hump 
          in the cement toward the right/middle of the picture facing away.</font></p>

          on the left is on top of an elevator, which also could be used for launch. 
          The missile on the right is at the end of the track on a launch. Notice 
          the yellow metal brace that sits behind the missile. You'll see that 
          in many of the photos of the various sites (although not this site). 
          The tracks are gone from all of the sites. Other things that yuo will 
          see are the vents and hatch doors.</font></p>
