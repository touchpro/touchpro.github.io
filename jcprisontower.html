There's only one guard tower left from the days when Junction City was a functioning prison.  Two of the others were removed and now serve--at ground level--as admission booths at the Perry County Fairgrounds in New Lexington.

The stairs leading up to the guard booth are very narrow and hard to climb.  The first time I went up I hit my head on the edge of the metal hatch and cussed a lot.  There's a decent view from the top--at least in one direction.
