This enormous industrial complex is recognizably abandoned even from a distance--and it's only from a considerable distance that most people can even glimpse it.  I first caught sight of it by craning my head to the right as I took the exit ramp from I-70 westbound onto I-675, not far east of Dayton.  To get close to it, you have to leave the freeway there and wend your way among the backroads until you find yourself alongside a neglected perimeter fence.  The plant is close to Huber Heights but not in the city proper.

The outer fence line runs to the railroad tracks and then turns to follow them, bringing you even closer to the building itself.

After a while it even angles away from the tracks, and you're able to get close enough to really make out some detail without ever going on the property.

As you can see, the Price Brothers Concrete Plant is really a group of joined buildings.  First there's the tall, complicated-looking processing plant at the end, quite visibly rusted and beginning to buckle, as you can tell in the picture here.

The middle is made up of tall grey concrete storage cylinders in a wide, straight line interrupted once by a right angle.  It gives the building its overall L shape.  There are so many that they form multiple rows that you can walk between.

Finally there are the multi-story offices at the other end of the not-inconsiderable whole shebang.  (I assume they were nothing but offices, though often in industrial plants like this they have floors with no walls where heavy work gets done; they just look like any other office from the outside.)

According to the information I've been able to get (much of it tipped to me by generous contributors), this was originally the FlexCore concrete plant, but most recently (and for the longest stretch of time) it was owned and operated under the name Price Brothers.  Other similar plants exist in the Fairborn/Medway area.  This one stands in an awkward spot when it comes to placing it in an Ohio geographic category; partway between Medway and Huber Heights, and also in the region where Montgomery, Clark, and Greene Counties all converge.  I'll need a very accurate map reading, or--even better--a verdict from the GPS, in order to place it correctly and without doubt.

Come back soon and take a look at the interior of the Price Brothers concrete manufacturing plant, which I explored while my girlfriend hid in the car.  It was daytime, and since I've never heard even a rumor of a Price Brothers ghost story, I figured I wasn't losing anything of the experience by going inside during the day, when the sunlight makes everything much easier to see (not to mention photograph).  At any rate, you will be able to see inside the plant as soon as possible.  I visited it in February of that year.  And I can't forget to thank John Neiser, and Jen Allen, and Ryan and Amy Glass--without whom I wouldn't know much of anything about this mysterious and alluring piece of industrial wreckage way back in the fields of the NE Dayton suburbs.
