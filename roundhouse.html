I had heard rumors of a building in Logan shaped like a giant golf ball, but I wasn't sure if it was abandoned or not.  Then one day my girlfriend and I stumbled upon it while trying to find a canoe rental place after staying in a cabin in the Hocking Hills.  All I can say is...weird.

The thing is about two stories tall, made entirely of poured concrete, and completely spherical above a rectangular foundation.  I had no idea at all what it was once used for.  My best guess would have had to be some kind of sports-related thing, maybe a golf supply place.
<P>
It was high summer when we visited the Round House, and it was buried in weeds and vegetation.  This combined with the heat and the wasps made exploration pretty unpleasant.  In the winter I kept looking forward to summer, but now I think fall is the best time to explore things like this.  While I was there I brushed a black insect off my hand and ended up having my knuckle swell up because whatever it was bit me.

Above you can see some of the amusing, barely-literate No Trespassing warnings painted on the garage door of the Round House.  The first part says "ALL TRESPASSER'S WHO SURVIVE THE HAZARDS THAT OTHER" and then some stuff I didn't get a good picture of.  "OTHERS HAVE NOT," maybe?  As far as I could tell, the "HAZARDS THAT OTHERS" have had such trouble with amounted to a pile of filthy junk inside what is basically a one-room structure.  But my favorite line is the one that says "TRESPASSERS CREATED WILL ALL BE PROSECUTED TO THE LIMITS OF THE LAW."  Trespassers created?  Huh?  We can assume that the people who look after the Round House are either not native English speakers, or long-time residents of Hocking County.  (KIDDING.)

As it turns out, the Round House was a private residence which belonged to an eccentric Logan man.  He got sick and died before it could be completed.  You have to wonder what will become of such an odd building.
