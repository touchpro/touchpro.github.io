      <td><p align="center"><font color="#000066">Originally Purchased around 
          the turn of the Century by Charles Vollmar, this small family owned 
          park sat on the banks of the Maumee River in Bowling Green Ohio. The 
          park actually closed in the 1940's, with the exception of a roller skating 
          rink, until purchased by the Hofner's in 1963. It was at that point 
          that rides were added, and the park became more of an amusement park 
          type of environment. It was operated by Mike Hofner, and his family, 
          for over 25 years. The park would typically open around Mother's day, 
          and operate in to late fall. It included several flat rides, a small 
          coaster, roller skating, food, picnicing, and much more family friendly 
          fun. Eventually, costs exceeded income, and the rides were auctioned 
          off... most likely due to their high insurance and maintenance costs. 
          After auctioning the rides in the late 1980's, the park operated on 
          its own until 2001 when the gates were closed for good. I've read accounts 
          of the park operating with some small carnival type rides in its dying 
          days, but I'm not sure excatly where that fit in to the picture. Like 
          many small parks, Vollmar's simply became unable to operate from a financial 
          standpoint, but until that point, it was an area favorite for locals. 
          The property was to be auctioned some time in late 2002, but turn out 
          was low and bids not adequate for the Hofner's. To the best of my knowledge, 
          they chose to keep the park, and I'm not aware of that having changed 
          up to this point. As of my visit to the grounds, the only remaining 
          signs of a park were a great ballroom right on the river, an old hotel, 
          some small pavillion and storefront type buildings, a bridge, and some 
          sheds. </font></p>
