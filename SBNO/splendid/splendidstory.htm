        China is mere minutes from Disney World, yet the park is virtually unknown 
        to many. Why? Well that all depends on who you ask. The park suffered 
        many set backs that eventually led to a premature closure. Oddly enough, 
        some people would like to take at least partial credit for that closure.</font></p>

        So what was Florida Splendid China? Shenzhen China is home to the original 
        Splendid China Miniature park... a park that showcases many of the great 
        wonders of China in approximately one tenth scale. Florida Splendid China 
        was a sister park to the extremely popular Chinese version. The park housed 
        some sixty attractions many of which were tiny replicas of real wonders 
        of China. These ranged from the Great Wall of China, Forbidden City and 
        more, to much larger scale statues like the thousand hands thousand eyes, 
        as well as theaters, performers, eateries, shops, fountains, and more. 
        The park opened in 1993 and closed a short 10 years later in 2003. </font></p>

  <tr> 
    <td><p><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Now 
        one of the most important things to note is that not everyone was impressed 
        with the new park. Before the park even opened, it was being protested 
        by groups that felt the park was propaganda from the Chinese Government. 
        To add to their suspicion, the Republic of China did have partial ownership 
        in the park. Keep in mind that China is a Communist country, and is often 
        the subject of many human rights issues. These groups felt that the park 
        put a happy face on China that ignored the suffering of the repressed 
        religious of the land. In addition, some of the parks miniatures were 
        recreations of sacred religious buildings of those very repressed groups. 
        I don't know that this is an accurate comparison, but imagine if the US 
        government outlawed the practice of the Lutheran religion in this country, 
        and then touted the Lutheran churches of the US in other countries.</font></p>

  <tr> 
    <td width="50%"><p><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So 
        what did all of this protest mean to Splendid China? It meant that throughout 
        the entire time that the park was in operation, it was often housing protesters 
        outside of its gates, and on some occasions, even inside the gates. That's 
        never good for a tourist attraction. In addition, its my understanding 
        that these groups pushed for schools to not take children there. The school 
        field trip is typically a good source of income for a place like this. 
        To add insult to injury, some of the performers from the park that had 
        been brought over from China used their opportunity in the United States 
        to flee their homeland, meaning the park had to replace their performers. 
        Eventually they got wise and hired locals.</font></p>

        it would end up, the parks demise may have just been capitalism in itself. 
        The park just couldn't compete with nearby Disney World, and especially 
        Epcot, which had its own China, as well as many other countries. The park 
        opened its gates to some 3000 guests, and eventually dwindled to around 
        200 per day. Online accounts of trips to the park show it to be nearly 
        empty at times, seeing only a few guests here and there. </font></p>

        absolute final blow to the park came in the form of the September 11th 
        attacks that led to a decline in tourism. The already struggling park 
        could no longer draw crowds, and after presumably hemorrhaging significant 
        amounts of money, closed its gates forever on December 31st 2003. An auction 
        of many of the goods followed in 2004, and that was the end of the park 
        for most... I say most because you are at sbno, and its not over for us 
        until the last building is bulldozed in to history. After hearing about 
        the park, I couldn't forget about it until I had the chance to bring you, 
        the readers of this site, the pictures you deserve to see.</font></p>

        I arrived in 2006, I was shocked to see how much of the park still remained. 
        Most of the great wall, which stretched nearly a half mile, and made with 
        individual one inch bricks.. lots of them... like a shocking amount, was 
        still standing. The Grand Buddha statue was nearly untouched. There was 
        plenty of vandalism on the miniatures, but many still resembled intact 
        buildings. The detail was unimaginable. I can't imagine how they were 
        able to build these tiny buildings, with accuracy, able to bear the elements, 
        and on a tight timeline. Construction had started in 1989, so that meant 
        that they were built over a three year period, subtract the various land 
        preparations and whatnot, and you have a tight timeline.</font></p>

        slowly the park deteriorated, short on income, and plagued by protests. 
        The recipe was not that of success. Ultimately people just weren't overly 
        interested. Many of the restaurants remained closed and empty... How many 
        chinese restaurants can you have in one park? The performers had fled. 
        There were no real rides of any type. The shops were rumored to be a but 
        shotty. The admission price wasn't low, and word was out that the park 
        was struggling. After closing and auctioning off some of the more valuable 
        goods, the park was left to rot away, and that it has. Locals have trashed 
        many of the features. A moron with some matches has managed to burn one 
        of the buildings and started fires in at least two other that I saw.</font></p>

    <td height="162"><p><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">So 
        that's the short version of the days of Florida Splendid China. I made 
        two trips in to the park after it was closed. One trip was in 2006 and 
        a follow up came in late 2008. The 2006 trip was one of the absolute worst 
        trips I have ever taken in to any abandoned building. The temps were very 
        high, I didn't take water, I walked about 2 miles to get in to the rear 
        entrance of the park, and I nearly thought I was going to die. When I 
        got to the front of the park, nearer to were I was parked, I heard people 
        coming toward me... official sounding people, and had to run all the way 
        back to the rear of the park, and all the way back around to my car... 
        already thirsty, in flip flops that had already worn through my skin, 
        and ready to give up and let the buzzards have me. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">My 2008 
        trip was a little better. I went in the early morning. I started at the 
        front of the park this time and made sure no one would be chasing me out. 
        I never heard a soul this time. I thought I heard some things and kept 
        myself on my usual uncomfortable high aleart, but alas, no problems. I 
        took water... everything was great, except I ran out of memory card space, 
        so I didn't get as many pictures as I had wanted. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Anyway, 
        that's my experience with Florida Splendid China. Its really a sad sight 
        to see the amount of work that went in to this place being destroyed by 
        bored kids, but on the flip side, its probably only a matter of time until 
        a construction worker does the job with a dozer.</font></p>
