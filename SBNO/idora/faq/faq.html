<b>
Q). Where is Idora Park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Idora is in Youngstown Ohio on the border of Mill Creek Park. Ask anyone in the area and they can get you right to the gate very easily.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Why did the park close?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). A fire burnt down the parks biggest attraction... the WildCat. The park was already beginning to strugle, mostly due to bigger parks near by. Some have suggested, and let me make clear that this site in no way endorses, supports, or even likes the thought of this, that the large turn out of African American people at the park was turning away business. I've seen this in a few emails that I've received as well as in an online document that was written for a school project. I only mention this because I've heard it quite a few times and want readers to know that I am aware of this theory. Hopefully race relations weren't that poor in the 1980s, but I was so young I hardly remember. 
<br><br>
Anyway, once the WildCat burnt, the park's attendance fell off even more and the park could not afford to stay open.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). When did the park close?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). 1984 sort of... the park did sort of work after that for a short time, but that was basically the end. My parents went to a fund rasier there after the park was closed. They tried to continue using the ballroom for a while. The park fizzled out through the mid 80s. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Who ownes/owned the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). The last I knew. A church owned the park. This may have changed. The park was the Mount Calvary Pentecostal I think. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). What happened to the _______ ride at the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). It depedns on the ride, but many of the original rides were auctioned.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Why did the park leave the rides that were left?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Many of them are too difficult to move. Most of the rides that are gone are similar to carnival rides in that they can be put on a Truck and moved with relative ease. The coasters obviously cannot be moved easily.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Where can I find books on the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). There is a book out about the park... Idora Park: The Last Ride of Summer
by Rick Shale, Karen Morrison (Designer), Charles J., Jr. Jacques. It can be found at Borders, Barnes and Noble, Amazon, and hopefully at your local book retail store (support the small guy first if you can!!).
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Can I get permission to go in and take pictures?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). There really isn't much to see now. I haven't heard of anyone getting permission, but I suppose it would be possible. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). How can I get in to the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Unfortunately again, there isn't really anything left. The last time I was there, you could have just walked on to the grounds as the side that the ballroom used to 'fence' off is now open.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Do you have a copy of a park Map?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). I'm not aware of any official park map from back when the park was open. I have seen copies online of a hand drawn map that was featured in a calendar. I don't have a copy though. Sorry!
<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>
Q). What is left in the park now.
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). On my last check... the ICEE stand, the Picnic shelters, and the old bathroom building near the wild cat. Everything else is now gone. Most recently lost was the Ballroom, Jack Rabbit, and Wild Cat. There are still many foundations in the ground, but not much else.
