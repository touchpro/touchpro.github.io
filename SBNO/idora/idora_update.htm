  <tr>
    <td><p>This will be the last update to the Idora section. My most recent visit 
        to the park was dissappointing, yet at the same time expected. As it ends 
        up, the park is entirely gone. There are a few foundations and stair ways 
        remaining, but the rides, buildings, etc are otherwise all gone. Its difficult 
        to even tell where some of the buildings once stood. I grabbed a bunch 
        of pictures of what remains, but they really aren't in any specific order 
        since they're mostly just pictures of grass and similar nonesense. </p>
      <p>After the final fire that destroyed the ballroom, the remains on the 
        grounds were bulldozed. I'm assuming this was done to avoid another fire 
        and other similar hazzards. </p>
