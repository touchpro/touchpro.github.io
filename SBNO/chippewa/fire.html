I'm sad to announce that the Chippewa Lake Ballroom has burnt to the ground. The Fire was reported to have started at about 4:00pm on June 13th 2002. From what I understand, a young girl accidentally started the blaze while playing with fire in the ballroom. Preservationists were obviously saddened and outraged by the loss.
