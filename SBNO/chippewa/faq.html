<b>
Q). Where is Chippewa Lake Park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Chippewa Lake Park is Located in Chippewa Lake Ohio near Medina. Yahoo MAPS will help pinpoint the exact location, but be careful. Yahoo last had the park across the highway from its actual location.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Why did the park close?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Chippewa officially closed due to lack of attendance, although many other rumors have been told. The most prominant is that they weren't able to get gambling approved for the grounds. Gambling would have generated the income needed to build the park found on the 1973 report housed also on this page.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). When did the park close?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). After the 1978 Season.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Who ownes/owned the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Continental Business Enterprises, INC of Northfield Ohio currently (June 2002) ownes the park as far as I know. This may have changed. Prior to that was Parker Beach.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). What happened to the _______ ride at the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). It depedns on the ride, but many of the original rides were sold or auctioned (not sure if it was an auction or sale). If you're asking about a ride that was there in the 1997 pictures on www.DefunctParks.com, but is gone now, it was probably taken by a local person in an attempt to restore or preserve the ride.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Why did the park leave the rides that were left?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Many of them are too difficult to move. Most of the rides that are gone are similar to carnival rides in that they can be put on a Truck and moved with relative ease. The coasters obviously cannot be moved easily. The bug is also a difficult ride to move, and even though it is rare today, it still isn't and certainly wasn't in big demand then. The cost of moving it and buying it was more than its worth. Same goes for the cages.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Where can I find books on the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). It seems that all of the books are out of print. You may find a used copy at www.ebay.com from time to time. I've also seen them listed on www.borders.com, but I've been told they are not available anymore. Some Libraries also carry the books and video(which I've never seen *hint hint* if you own it and want to copy it or sell it).
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Can I get permission to go in and take pictures?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). From what I've heard... No. I've been told numerous times that the owners and caretakes will not agree to this. If you are an owner or caretaker, please correct me if I'm wrong.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). How can I get in to the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Sorry, but it really wouldn't be right for me to help you do that. I can only tell you that it is usually a matter of walking right in, but that isn't always the case. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Will I get caught/do the locals care?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Some of the local people might care. I can tell you they WILL care if you go in there breaking stuff, making lots of noise, climbing on stuff, etc. If you are low key and repectful, most of the locals could care less as long as you stay off of their property and out of their way. You could still get caught. I've seen cop cars pass the park a few times. I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble, but it could happen. Your best bet is to explain honestly why you are there and hope for the best. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>
Q). Will you take me in to the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). Unfortunatly I don't have permission to go in to the park, so I'm of no help there. The park is a long drive for me, and ever since the ballroom burnt, I've tried to stay away from the area as it seems like people there are a little less trusting now. 
<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>
Q). Do you have a copy of a park Map?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). As far as I know, no park map was ever produced in paper form. If I'm wrong, I've yet to see a copy. If you have one that I can have a scanned copy of, please contact me at <a href "mailto:admin@illicitohio.com">admin@illicitohio.com</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>
Q). Can I buy/How Much is the park?
</b>
<br>
<br>
A). I've heard numbers ranging from 1 million to over 3 million. If you can buy it, feel free to also send me the $17 it takes every month to run the site where you found out about it! :) I'm kidding of course, but if you do have the money and really are interested... contact the owners as I can't really help you.
