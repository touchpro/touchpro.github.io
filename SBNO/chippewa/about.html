  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial">This is just a very brief section to tell you a little 
    about how I came to make a site about Chippewa Lake Park.</font></p>
  <table width="90%" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td><p align="center"><font face="Arial">Back in the late 1990's, I was 
          trying to find some information on Idora Park. I had grown up near Idora 
          but never really had the nerve to go very far in to the park. A friend 
          and I got to talking about it, and I decided to look it up on the net 
          to see if there was any information. At that time, there wasn't much, 
          but I found a site called <a href="http://www.defunctparks.com" target="_blank">defucntparks.com</a> 
          that listed abandoned parks by state, and noticed that Chippewa Lake 
          Park was listed there. I checked out their pictures, and decided I had 
          to go see it for myself... and that is where it all began. Since then 
          I've been to several other parks, all featured here at <a href="http://sbno.illicitohio.com" target="_blank">sbno.illicitohio.com</a>. 
          I was only 2 years old when Chippewa Lake closed, so needless to say, 
          I knew very little about it. Since then I've been fortunate enough to 
          receive tons of emails, corrections, books, etc on the park, so I now 
          feel as though I've been there... well I mean, when it was open. Of 
          course I've been there. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Some important things about the site 
          in terms of navigation. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom 
          of every page that will take you to the other pages on the site. If 
          you have a lot of restrictions on your browser for safety (pop up blockers, 
          active x controls, etc) it will prevent many of the features from working 
          unfortunately. I'm not trying to do any harm to your PC of course, these 
          are just useful tools that are exploited by people wanting to do harm, 
          so when on my safe, you should be safe to allow any active x, java script, 
          pop ups, etc when prompted by your browser.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">For example, Internet Explorer users 
          will see something like this at the top of their browser window...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="main/activexwarning.PNG" width="859" height="25"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">If you click the 'here' for options, 
          it is ok to allow the content on my site in order to be able to use 
          the navigation.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Anyway, to keep this short, please 
          check out the site if you haven't, and take a virtual trip to Chippewa 
          Lake Park!</font></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font face="Arial">Feel free to drop me a line by email with anything you 
    think is interesting, and I'll do my best to respond. I'm typically very slow 
    at responding unfortunately, but I'll certainly try. Thanks for checking out 
    the site!</font></p>
