          site dedicated to the still standing (as of 2008), but unfortunately 
          fading Chippewa Lake Park, in Chippewa Lake Ohio, near Seville, which 
          is somewhat near Medina. The Park closed at the end of the 1979 season 
          after being in operation for over 100 years. For much of its life, the 
          park was operated by the Beach family, but it actually started with 
          Ed Andrews who purchased the park in 1875, as a picnic grounds, with 
          intentions of cleaning it up a little. One thing led to another, and 
          by 1877 there was an admission charge. By the 1930's, the park had gone 
          in to receivership and was on the block, when manager Mac Beach's son 
          made his bid of $3,500... and with almost no money to back it. He was 
          able to pull funds together, and over time he was able to pay down the 
          debts that had caused the problems in the first place. Parker would 
          go on to operate the park until his retirement in 1969, when it was 
          purchased by Continental Business Enterprises of Northfield Ohio. Continental 
          apparently had big plans for the park, many of which have been rumored 
          to require approval for gambling, which never came to light. Continental 
          operated the park until as an amusement park 1978, followed by one last 
          Octoberfest celebration in 1979. At that point, the gates were closed 
          forever.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">Over the years that the park operated, 
          its impossible to recall even a significant fraction of the events, 
          meetings, memories, and good times that the park served up for its visitors. 
          Countless band performances, dances, shows, rides, meals, vacations, 
          and more took place on the grounds. When I visited, first in the late 
          1990's, only small hints of this once great park remained. Over the 
          following years, those remains slowly began to disappear. I've done 
          my best to get photos of those buildings and rides and assemble them 
          for you here. I apologize in advance for any errors, bad photos, etc. 
          I started out with a really poor quality 35 mm camera, adorned with 
          the Marlboro logo if that gives you any idea, and eventually moved on 
          to a cheap digital, and then a slightly less cheap digital... because 
          of this, the photo quality is poor. I made approximately seven trips 
          to the park over the years, spread out from 1999 up to 2007, and then 
          one quick stop outside the gates in 2008. </font></p>
