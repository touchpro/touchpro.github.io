      <td height="30"><p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">The Flying Cages are 
          another of the many rides featured at Chippewa Lake that were extremely 
          popular at one time and can no longer be found. My personal experience 
          with Flying Cages is that almost as many people stood around to watch 
          them as what rode them... I've only stood and watched them at the carnival. 
          They were added in the later days of the park, I believe for the 1962 
          season. In case you've never seen them, essentially they were counter 
          weighted cages that pivoted in two spots to give a swinging circular 
          motion. They were human powered. The idea was to get in the cage, and 
          shift your weight back and forth to get the car swining from side to 
          side. If you were a big kid, you could get the cage the entire way up 
          and over. If you were most kids, you just envied those who could and 
          often got hurt trying. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">When I first visited the park in 
          the late 1990's, the cages were still intact, and if not for the floors 
          being rotted away and trees being in the way, they were still very usable. 
          I got in one and swung a little, but it was too overgrown. Upon a later 
          trip after 2001, I realized the cars had been taken away, most likely 
          by locals who wanted to preserve them. As of this writing, the only 
          thing standing is the structure and the counterweights. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF6600" size="2" face="Arial">**Interesting note, but if you look 
          in the background of the classic picture at the top, you can see the 
          open air theater in the background, and it appears to be painted orange.</font></p>
