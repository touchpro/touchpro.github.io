          and fires however a few still remain. If you check out the current pictures

          <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Here is a great article that talks about 
            the life and times of Chippewa Lake Park. Use this as a brief history! 
            There is evidence of where the park is headed when it closes its doors 
            some nine to ten years later. Parker Beach talks of the large crowds 
            and good times at Chippewa Lake. Note the mention of the size and 
            land of the lake and park mentioned in the second column. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><br>
            &quot;Amusement parks aren't the glamor business they once were&quot; 
            says Beach. Yet another sign of where the park is headed. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><br>
            The article is a little dark in spots as news articles always seem 
            to be when they are scanned. If there are problems reading it I can 
            try to do a text version of it. </font><br>

            The top picture gives a clear shot of the ballroom and the Burger 
            Factory. This view is now extremly cluttered by trees and brush. <br>
            The secoind picture shows miss chippewa docked up near what appears 
            to be the Picnic Shelter. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial">The Shelter was lost in the 1980's due 
            to a fire. Today all that stands where the shelter once was is some 
            burnt equipment and filing cabnets and one recognizable corner. </font></p>

            The bottom picture is of famous people who had visited Chippewa Lake 
            Park. I think its safe to assume they are long since gone. Hopefully 
            they were taken out and are somewhere now. <br>

      <td height="210"><div align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">How about 
          that coaster. The Fred Pierce out and back still stands at Chippewa 
          Lake today. There is damage and growth, but this thing was built to 
          last. Check out the current pictures of it if you haven't already in 
          the current pictures section. The coaster used three car trains if I'm 
          not mistaken and was an out and back type with a bit of a different 
          path to the lift hill. It was called both the Big Dipper and Coaster.

          in what appears to be the Ballroom. The horses now would be worth a 
          fortune. If anyone knows where the ride or horses went off to feel free 
          to email me at admin@illicitohio.com. I think I remember someone telling 
          me where they are and now I can't remember. <br>
          The building that the merry-go-round was housed in is still there. Unfortunately 
          it has collapsed almost completely. <br>
          There really isn't much else for me to say about the horses. I feel 
          like I need to fill up this space so there isn't too much white. <br>

          of the midway area in full effect. Look at the crowds around that tumble 
          bug. Off in the distance to the right you can see the Hambuger Factory 
          (i think) and in the center you can see what I think was an eatery of 
          some sort. There is still a little bit of this building still standing 
          now. Most of it is burnt as is the case with too many of the Chippewa 
          Lake buildings. Why anyone would ever burn these places down is beyond 
          me.</font> </div></td>
