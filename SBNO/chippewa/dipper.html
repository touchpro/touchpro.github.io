      <td><p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">Built by the Pearce Family in 
          the mid 1920's, the Big Dipper was one of three coasters in Chippewa 
          Lake Park by the time the park closed. The Big Dipper, also called 'Coaster' 
          for some time was one of a small number of coasters built by the Pearce 
          Brothers. The Big Dipper is often thought to be the first coaster in 
          the park, but actually there was a coaster of an unknown name that existed 
          prior to the dipper. The previous coaster was much less conventional 
          and required the cars to be pushed to the top of the hill. Very little 
          information exists on this previous coaster other than that it was basically 
          a hill, track, and a car in which people rode down said hill.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">The Big Dipper remained a main attraction at the 
          park until the day the park closed. It is said that it was the single 
          most expensive upgrade ever added to Chippewa Lake and that it was well 
          worth every penny. Its impossible to even guess the number of riders 
          that took a trip around the out and back layout of the Big Dipper during 
          its day.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">The Big Dipper was a wooden Out and Back style Coaster, 
          meaning just what it sounds, that the cars leave the station, make a 
          long trip away from the station, make a turn, and head back to the station. 
          This is in comparison to various other layouts of the time, such as 
          figure eights, L shaped out and backs, etc. Of course in the days of 
          steel coasters and computer engineering, the possible layouts are endless, 
          but back in the day, the out and back was a very common design. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">According to rumor, the Pearce brothers later contacted 
          Chippewa Lake Park to get copies of their own coaster plans to build 
          a similar coaster at Cedar Point. I've heard conflicting rumors on this, 
          one saying that the coaster was one of the rides no longer at the park, 
          and the other saying that the coaster that was built was the Blue Streak. 
          The Pearce brother's history doesn't lend kind to this rumor however 
          as I've found no evidence of any Pearce coaster ever existing at Cedar 
          Point. It is possible that the plans were used by another builder. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">Most of the Pearce coasters are now gone. The Big 
          Dipper at Geauga Lake is said to be a very similar ride, however that 
          is a Miller Coaster, so there would be many differences, and of course, 
          it was recently defunct when Geauga Closed its gates forever. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">The condition of the Big Dipper 
          today is unfortunately very grim. Large trees have fallen through many 
          sections of the coaster. The wood is rotted very badly. The station 
          is finally starting to collapse, although given the neglect and amount 
          of time that it has been standing, it is doing very well. The land on 
          which the turn around area sits is basically a swamp now, so I can't 
          imagine that any of the footers would be solid. In short, the coaster 
          is well beyond any hope of repair. Locals have stolen or removed the 
          coaster cars, the brake levers, signeage, etc. Recent rumors of development 
          at the park site may mean that by the time you read this, the coaster 
          will be gone, just shy of reaching its mid 80s. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">Below are pictures from various 
          trips to the park over the years from 1999 up to 2008. The winter trip 
          that I took in 2005 was one of my favorite.. there was a certain peacefulness 
          that you can only get on a cold snowy ohio winter day. Enjoy!</font></p>
