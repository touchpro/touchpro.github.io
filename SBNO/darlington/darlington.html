    <TD width="100%"><FONT size=4>Darlington Lake was a small park located in 
      Dalington Pennsylvania not far across the border from my hometown of East 
      Palestine Ohio. My Grandparents, Father, and aunts lived in one of the 
      lake cottages during a great part of their childhood years. The park 
      started life as a small lake resort area similar to Chippewa Lake Park, or 
      even Cedar Point. The lake never ended up becoming a full fledged 
      amusement park like some of the others, but still provided great times for 
      both visitors and relatives. <BR><BR>After the recent and unfortunate loss 
      of my Grandfather, my Aunt came across some postcards from the lake. She 
      was gracious enough to provide the postcards as well as a brief account of 
      her memories of the days she spent living at the Lake. I have provided 
      scans of both of those cards here as well as a poorly made map that I 
      recreated from my Aunt's hand drawn map and some highlights of her 
      memories of the Lake. There is also a sattelite picture of the park taken 
      from terraserver.com. <BR><BR>Darlington lake is about one hour 'westish' 
      of Pittsburgh. My father spent much of his life there as did his siters 
      and parents. To this day, two of the sisters, my aunts, are still living 
      there. The lake is still used for swimming, but there is no longer camping 
      there, a dike has been built separating the lake and the cottages, and 
      most of the old cottages are now used as homes.

    <TD width="100%"><FONT size=4>My Aunt was kind enough to put together a 
      small account of some of the memories she has of the lake. <BR><BR>One of 
      the post cards that she found was a postcard sent from their Aunt Lucille 
      sent to my Great Grandparents (her parents). The other shows pictures of 
      boys and girls swimming in the "lower pool". There is a wooden slide and a 
      diving platform in the picture, as well as the bridge on the main road 
      with a family watching the swimming going on. My aunt notes that the water 
      was so deep around the diving platform that no one ever touched bottom 
      when diving. She also notes that the slide was wooden, and very hard on 
      bathing suits. Ouch! <BR><BR>Downstream from the lower pool was a dam. 
      People fished by the dam where the water was also very deep. The dam was a 
      popular place for tanning. My aunt also mentions that brave souls would 
      sit under the water coming through the dam and cool off. The area under 
      the dam was referred to as the hole. She mentions tha she almost drown 
      there once and had to be pulled from the water. She isn't alone. She also 
      mentions that she pulled others from the water as she grew up. 
      <BR><BR>People entered the recreation area via the upper road. Entrants 
      came to a 6' tall fence covered in pink roses and a tollbooth. The entry 
      fee was .25 cents. People who lived there entered free because the 
      belonged to the Darlington lake Association. <BR><BR>My Aunt spent her 
      teen years like many others at the lake at the pool or dancing to the 
      jukebox. Living in the area allowed my aunt to meet people from all of the 
      place including a family from New York who stayed in a cottage rented out 
      by her aunt. They taught her to sing "Sidewalks of New York". There were 
      also boyscout groups that stayed at the lake. My Aunt recounts a time when 
      the boyscouts were rained out. Most left, taking the food with them, and 
      the remaining scouts had to live on green tomatoes intil their parents 
      came to get them. <BR><BR>According to my aunts description, the lake 
      housed a large picnic house with a stage as well as a dance hall with 
      refreshment stand. <BR><BR>The Resort area at the lake slowly faded away 
      to become mostly just a swimming area with the cottages being used as 
      homes. I plan on getting some pictures of the lake are as it stands now. 
      Below are a map and a sattelite photo of the lake. They don't really 
      correspond well at all. One is actually facing the other direction than 
      the other. <BR><BR></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
