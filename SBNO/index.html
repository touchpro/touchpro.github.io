          <p><font color="#333333" face="Courier New">Welcome to standing but 
            not operating. A site dedicated to bringing you abandoned amusement 
            parks, their history, and mostly, pictures of them standing, but not 
            in operation. The site gets updated as frequently as possible, but 
            quite honestly, no where neary as often as I'd like. The most recent 
            revamp of the site was in late 2008.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Courier New">So anyway, come on inside 
            and check out the pictures. There are several parks featured, some 
            with a small number of pictures, and others with hundreds of pictures 
            taken over a long period of time. Some pictures are blurry, some are 
            just poorly thought out, and others are great, but only by chance. 
            I'm not a photographer, I'm just a guy who takes pictures, so don't 
            set your expectations high.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Courier New">Lastly, feel free to send 
            me an email. I try my best to respond, but often times I get behind 
            on email and eventually have to just give up and start fresh. Please 
            don't be offended if I don't respond. </font></p>
