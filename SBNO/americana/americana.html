AMERICANA MAY BE CLOSED!!!!
<br>
I kept the below post so we can keep track, but from what I've HEARD... Americana is not open this year (2003). It sounds like they do plan to reopen though. I wish them the best of luck next year.

    <TD><FONT size=3><FONT color=red>Americana Amusement Park is in 
      LeSourdsville Lake. A recent email from an angry viewer prompted me to finally make some corrections and updates about the location and state of the park. As clearly stated above, the park is now reopen for PAID business. As any regular readers know, we never endorse entering a park illegally as the entire reason for this site is to preserve small parks like Americana and their history.</FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=3><FONT color=red>Americana is right next door to the old 
      Fantasy Farm. Fantasy Farm is the abandoned park that we were visiting when we ran in to Americana. American's fate was grim at the time of our visit. The park was closed and did not reopen for the following seasons. I'm acually surprised the park did reopen given the larger Ohio parks it has within a few hours (or less) drive. </FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR>

    <TD><FONT size=3><FONT color=red>I still stand by my statement that at the time I'm not even sure if we did anything illegal when we entered. We certainly did nothing harmful. We walked through some woods near the park to get a better view. We walked up the bank of the river, and we were in the park. At the time I wrote this I commented that this would be a great way to enter the park if open although to anyone who has been to the park, this is an obvious joke as there is no way someone could get away with this given the layout of the park.... anyway, this is the first view we got after coming up the riverbank. Its a somewhat behind the scenes area. </FONT></FONT>

    <TD><FONT size=3><FONT color=red>The picture to the left shows where the 
      "turnpike" cars went under the coaster. Notice this beam is still white. 
      If I remember correctly the entire coaster was originally white. It 
      appears to have had the wood replaced. I originally could only comment on what the coaster looked like, but I have since road it, and it is wicked. This is one of the last old school woodies in the area. It originally came from Moxahala park from what I understand. At the time, we did consider pulling a National Lampoon's American Vacation by forcing the guard to run the rides, but I don't think Americana's owners are as nice as Roy Wally.

      is not on this site, but it can eventually be found at <A 
      href="http://www.forgottenohio.com">Forgotten Ohio.</A> I 
      was too afraid of getting in trouble for climbing around on the coaster. My friend wasn't... The resulting picture turned out really good. 
      Those hills are steeper than they look when you see them up close. I can now tell you that they throw you from your seat like you wouldn't believe. It's worth the cost to get in for one ride on this unfortunately short coaster.

    <TD><FONT size=3><FONT color=red>Inside the giant tent we found most of 
      the ride cars in storage. I was surprised that they didn't store them 
      somewhere better than this, specially the turtles. It appeared to be 
      mostly kiddy ride cars unless people in LeSourdsville are really small. 
      There were also some tilt-a-whirl cars here. I wish we'd have gotten our 
      picture taken in one of them. My partner 'Charlie' sat in one of the 
      helicopters, but it almost tipped over and killed him so we moved on.

      one of the turtles up close. I wish I had inspected it more to see if it 
      was a real Traver turtle ride. I'm sure anyone who knows anything about 
      them could tell me right away. It looked a little to new to be a real one, 
      but if I'm not mistaken, Traver did build kiddy turtles. </FONT></FONT>
