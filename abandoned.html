The most impressive pieces of Ohio's history are those which are still standing:  abandoned buildings and forgotten places.  I've visited quite a few and have so many on my to-do list that I'll never be all the way done.  Each of the places I've visited is profiled here, with a little on its history and its current state.  At this point I should probably say that I don't condone trespassing, or that it's dangerous to visit these places, but honestly I don't care if you go, as long as you don't vandalize.  Just be careful.
