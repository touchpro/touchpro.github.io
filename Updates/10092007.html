What happened to Forgotten Ohio?  What happened to me?  I've read these questions in my e-mail inbox and even, to my flattered surprise, on message boards which deal with the weird side of Ohioana.  I've been a lax updater for some time now, but the last year or so has surpassed even my low standards.  Occasionally I'll promise a return to my old proficiency, but this time I'll spare you the insult to your intelligence and just say this:  I'll try.  I have the material, and much of it is ready to go.  Some of it is even on the website already.  The rest has to be developed and scanned, but I know I'm capable of that.  And let me tell you, I've been to some amazing places.  I'd like to show them to you before the month of my visit ages two years.
<p>
As the wonderful Halloween month approaches, I'll be posting material at what's become lightning speed for me as of late:  once a week, maybe even more.  Because, let's face it, the problem with the site lately hasn't exactly been that it's too hard to keep up with.  There's a new book listed among my <a href = "Sources/books.html">literary sources</a> called <i>Ghosts of the Ohio River</i> by Bruce Carlson.
<p>
Staying along the Ohio River, I have updates from the Eastern Ohio Valley region, beginning with a new haunting in flood-prone Shadyside, Belmont County:  <a href = "Counties/Belmont/coonholler.html">Coon Holler</a>.

And there's a decent-sized history and photographic profile of the abandoned, though not entirely forgotten, <a href = "Bridges/aetnaville.html">Aetnaville Bridge</a>.  It's prominent enough in local culture that it appeared as the cover image on a recent edition of Martins Ferry's Pulitzer-winning poet James Wright's <i>Complete Poems</i>.

There are other abandoned bridges to come, as well as a great many new hauntings and explorations of hauntings.  I've had the chance to visit several sites and look forward to developing and posting those photos to the site in their own sections.
<p>
Since we're now hip-deep in October, the official month of Forgotten Ohio, I have some media appearances to announce.  First of all, tomorrow morning (October 10) I'll be interviewed by the morning crew at <a href = "http://www.q92radio.com/">Q92 WZKL FM</a> in Canton to discuss Ohio's many haunted places and various other spooky stuff.  It's part of their morning show and will air between 8AM and 8:30.
<p>
I've gotten a few e-mails about the models who appear in a handful of select spots on the website, and I thought I'd take a moment this time to explain.  You see, I am no expert photographer.  In fact, my knowledge of how to operate a real live top-quality Nikon camera with one of those fancy lenses that comes off and a shutter you can leave open for a second in low light, with an f-stop and all that jazz...well, I just don't know a damn thing about it.  But I've been fortunate enough to have my photographs featured in newspapers, magazines, and other people's books, as well as on TV shows and official websites for things like NPR.  Whether you've earned it or not, if you're having photographs appear in the <i>Washington Post</i>, I figured, you should have some ability as a photographer.  So I read up on it and got some help from various friends who know their way around a camera, and I started taking photographs that aren't strictly for the website.
<p>
The thing is, my interest lies with the slightly dark and arcane, and I didn't want to go photographing sunsets in the mountains.  A couple of my friends, acquaintances, and friends-of-friends model on occasion, so I decided to work on my ability to photograph people--specifically, good-looking girls in cemeteries and abandoned buildings.  The results have been mixed only due to my own frequently-shaky camera work; the models have been nothing but wonderful.  It's nothing that I think will offend anyone (no sexual content, naturally--that's what I'm saying) and the good photos out of each session really are quality stuff.  I intend to create a little page for each model which lists the shoots we've done and where--that's something you'll see in a forthcoming update.  For now, here are a couple of examples, first of my lovely girlfriend Mandi, posing at the <a href = "../Drains/gates.html">Gates of Hell</a> drainage system in Columbus, and second of the very gorgeous Jamie, posing among the headstones at Greenlawn Cemetery.

Mandi, who just had a birthday on September 30, has a modelling portfolio done by actual professionals, which can be seen at <a href = "http://www.modelmayhem.com/member.php?id=397899">Model Mayhem</a>, and Jamie has been the subject of many professional shoots herself.  Jamie also got married very recently (September 23) to a great guy named Tim, so congratulations to them both.  My thanks go out to them, and to the other models, whose photos haven't been posted yet, for their help with the site.  If this is not something that's up your alley, hey, that's fine.  I'm not centering the website around it; it has the same focus as ever.  I just thought it would be a shame and a waste not to show off some of these appropriately-themed modelling shots.
