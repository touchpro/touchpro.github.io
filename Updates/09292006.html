Tomorrow's Class, Printing Problems
<font size = 4>
</center>
<br>
Real life intervenes once again.  Since I am working on my new book, actually doing the post-writing stuff now, I haven't had as much time as I'd like, and my computer access is more limited than ever.  But I've done lots of scanning and research, and will have new updates for everyone's favorite month, October.
<p>
Actually, it occurs to me that I could use some help.  It wasn't so long ago that I could print anything I wanted--at work, at school, at friends' houses.  (I've never owned a printer, for some retarded reason.)  But I realize that over the last year I've grown further and further away from free printing servies.  My new book, still in manuscript form, needs to go out to six different publishers and agents, and so far I've only been able to print one copy.  It's just under 400 pages long, which means that commercial printing would be prohibitively expensive.  At 10 cents a copy, each copy would be almost $40, and six copies would be $240.  Even if I ran into a discount, it would still be $120.  If I'm forced I might just pay it, but I'd like to think of a way to do this bulk printing a little more reasonably.  Any ideas out there?  If somebody has a decent laser printer at work and they don't mind, I'd be more than happy to buy an ink cartridge, and supply the paper as well.  The book is a Word file (compatible with either PC or Mac) on the website, easily accessed by anyone.  My gratitude would be enormous, and you'd definitely be thanked in the book and receive your own copy.  But anyway...
<p>
Only one more day left in September, and that's the day I do the second in my series of Saturday classes for Zane State Collge in Zanesville.  This time the theme is history:  "Ghost Towns and Abandoned Landmarks."  I had the opportunity to discuss the topic in an interview for WYBZ 107.3FM on Thursday, September 21.  Here are the details:

This update's edition of "Name That Building" spotlights another big building in Cleveland:

Richman Building?
<font size = 5>
<br>
Manufacturing District, East Side - Cleveland, Ohio
<font size = 4>
</center>
<br>
A big, dark brick building with a pair of five-story wings stands in a rather unsavory part of Cleveland's near east side.  Like the last building, I encountered it while on a work-related visit to the lovely city in the summer of 2004.

<br>
As you can see, a clue about the building's identity and purpose appears over the main entrance, where it says RICHMAN.  Obviously a factory or warehouse of some sort, but beyond that, I'm in the dark.  Does anyone know anything about this place?
<p>
<font color = "yellow">IDENTIFIED!<font color = "white">  As usual, my incredible readers come through with flying colors and give me the information about this old Cleveland packing-district warehouse.  This was the headquarters and main manufacturing center for the Richman Brothers Clothing Company, which was founded in 1879 as "The World's Greatest Clothing Factory," then purchased by FW Woolworth Co. in 1969.  Their original factory is depicted on an old stock certificate available for sale at <a href = "http://www.scripophily.net/ricbrotcom.html">this link</a>.  Credit goes to Bill and then Laura for identifying the company and its forlorn warehouse from two poorly-taken snapshots.
<p>
I will update again after tomorrow's class, and add a new section over the next week.  Enjoy the fall.
