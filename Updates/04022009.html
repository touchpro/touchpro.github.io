First of all, kudos to the smart people who identified the Huber Heights-area abandoned building for you.  It seems to sit at the intersection of three counties (Clark, Greene, and Montgomery), so we're not sure exactly where to list it yet.  GPS might have to fill us in on that one.

It's a concrete manufacturing plant, defunct for at least ten years, which once specialized in concrete ceiling beams for construction projects.  Originally Price Brothers, it operated for a time as FlexCore.

Thank you to Amy Glass for her help with the location issues, and especially to longtime contributor Ryan Glass.  I should be posting a nice big update on this one soon.

Speaking of which, here <i>is</i> a new update:  a new <a href = "../cemeteries.html">Creepy Cemetery</a> from the edge of Pickaway County called <a href = "../Cemeteries/Marcy/marcycem.html">Marcy Cemetery</a>.  It's a cool little village boneyard, well worth checking out on your own if you're ever down on Route 674 north of Amanda, Ohio.

Some expansions have been done, including a visit to the former site of <a href = "../Counties/Fairfield/amanda.html">Amanda Clearcreek High School</a>.  It was demolished and rebuilt a few blocks away, but the original spot is now occupied by a new school in the district--Amanda Clearcreek Primary--and I thought I'd start really keeping tabs on the Ohioana catalogued on my website.

In the same spirit, I photographed and expanded the little section about Columbus's <a href = "../Counties/Franklin/firemuseum.html">Fire Museum</a> on North Fourth Street downtown.
<br>
<br>
Check it all out and let me know what you think, what you'd like to see more of.  By way of preview, I'll just say that I have a lot of new photos to add, and that I'm considering posting my "to do" list of abandoned buildings (something I never did before because I was afraid people would get there first and cause the cops to start watching more closely, but if I make the list accessible only to the truly motivated...it's a thought, huh?).
<p>
Also, this horrendous economy cannot go uncommented upon, and I'd like to do an article about it and the way it's reflected in the abandonment of our cities, towns, and rural areas.  I recently toured some of Cleveland's and Columbus's worst neighborhoods and took lots of poignant photos, and I'd like to add Cincinnati and other places to that list, but in the meantime I may go ahead and post fresh sections.  Feedback, as always, is appreciated--and in the very near future I may be looking for stories related to losing one's job thanks to the way the private sector has handled its decade of unfettered <i>laissez-faire</i>.  I'm endlessly impressed by the intelligence of the feedback I get from people who enjoy this website.
<br>
<br>
Yes, new updates are forthcoming, and they'll be coming faster once I get my Adderall back.  Who doesn't know what it's like to be without your Adderall, huh?  Huh?  Ha!
