Profiled for today's update is the scenic (and notoriously haunted) <a href = "../Cemeteries2/cedarhill.html">Cedar Hill Cemetery</a> in Newark.  Go for the ghosts; stay for the scenic views of Licking County.  My photos were taken on one of the coldest days of the obscenely cold winter just past.

Mortuary art simply doesn't get any better than the nightmarish guardian of the Haserot family plot at <a href = "http://www.forgotteoh.com/LakeView/lakeview.html">Lake View Cemetery</a>.  "The Angel of Death Victorious," aka the <a href = "../LakeView/haserot.html">Haserot Death Angel</a>, is so irresistible that seemingly every twisted tourist takes at least one photo posing with her.  I've been shown more than I can count.

Hey look, that's me!  I mostly keep my goofy-ass self off the website, even when I'm in a magazine article or something, but in this case I'll use my own example to get things started.  Send me your own Haserot pictures--pictures of you and/or others posing with the Angel of Death herself--and I will post them in the new gallery I'm creating.  I'd like to include names and hometowns, but will of course leave anyone anonymous if they prefer.

Finally, you should <i>definitely</i> take a moment and watch this incredible YouTube video created by user TaraKitaideHunter.  It edits my own <a href = "../moonville.html">Moonville Tunnel page</a> into a video presentation with haunting music by Sun Kil Moon.  I could not be more honored.  Moonville was the first place I ever visited for Forgotten Ohio (when I was a sophomore at OSU) and it's one incredible legend I've collected a lot of information on, but this video manages to capture the creepy/irresistible essence of the legends better than I have.  Please do take a moment to leave a comment on YouTube.

Please do check out the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Forgotten-Ohio-wwwforgottenohcom/10150098583100072">Forgotten Ohio Group</a>; I didn't create it, but it's amazing and contains material by me and others, and plenty of stuff not found on the website.
