I am due for a <b>HUGE</b> update.  I mean massive.  I have most of the material for it, but to tell the truth I haven't had the opportunity to get most of my newest adventures into digital format.  My camera's been out on loan, and my older film still sits undeveloped.
<p>
Actually, what I'm currently engaged in is working out the details of a gallery show.  There was some interest from an owner in Columbus's Short North several years ago, but I'm only now exploring the possibilities.  I'm not experienced at this, though, and I could use some help or advice.  The way the event is arranged and financed eludes me, and if anybody knows anything about gallery shows I would appreciate their advice.  Having had the books published, and photos appear in places like the <i>Washington Post</i>, I figure I've got the right kind of material.  Even if I'm not a truly talented photographer, the subject matter is cool enough to attract attention.  For instance, Suzy Poling exhibited a photo at Chicago's Zg Gallery last winter that depicted the tree-filled ferris wheel at <a href = "../Chippewa/chippewa.html">Chippewa Lake Amusement Park</a>.  And I've got enough decent photographs of Forgotten Ohioana to fill several gallery shows.  So I've been talking to friends who exhibit here in Columbus and I'm hoping to have a show of my own.
<p>
As for the site, it's behind, and I want nothing more than to get my shit together and do a new update.  It's not that difficult, and I'm doing bits and pieces all the time.  My apologies for the brief update, but I wanted to let everybody know the site is not abandoned!
