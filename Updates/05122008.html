Remarkable Developments

<br>
It has been too long since my last update, I readily admit it.  I'm moving to a new apartment, and many of my photographs are just getting organized and scanned.  I'm going to need help identifying some of the places I've explored recently, so I'll be posting a few pictures on the updates page from time to time.  But, in all honesty, the updates will appear more frequently and be of a higher quality throughout the spring and summer.  Thank you for your patience; and thanks also to those who have e-mailed asking about the new update.  I'm glad to be reminded, actually.
<p>
There is dramatic news on several fronts related to Forgotten Ohio, though none quite as amazing as the arrest of a suspect in the murder of Jessica Lynn Keen.  Jessica, you'll recall, was the teenaged girl from Columbus's west side who turned up raped and murdered in the back corner of a Madison County graveyard back in March of 1991.  My page on <a href = "http://forgottenoh.com/Cemeteries/fosterchapel.html">Foster Chapel Cemetery</a> includes links to her story's inclusion on <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i>.  But it wasn't TV crime shows that produced a name here--it was DNA.  A recent state law required samples from Ohio felons, and one of them matched semen found with Jessica's body.  Back in 1991 it ruled her boyfriend out as a suspect (a lucky thing for him, because without DNA I'm sure the local cops would have been pleased as punch to "focus" on him with a nice sixteen-hour interrogation followed by a few decades in prison...not that I'm cynical or anything).  Now the DNA pointed to one man:  Marvin Lee Smith, Jr.

Mr. Smith, who was picked up in North Carolina last month, has a record:  he once served almost nine years in the Buckeye State for rape, burglary, and kidnapping.  They've charged him with the sexual imposition as something to hold him on, but the county prosecutors have already said they're just waiting for the test results to be reconfirmed before they hand him the capital murder.  Read about the case in <a href = "http://forgottenoh.com/News/jkeenkiller1.html">this <i>Dispatch</i> article</a> from May 6.  And please keep in mind that the presumption of innocence is a serious thing; the guy didn't necessarily have anything to do with Jessica's death, even though the circumstantial evidence described in the paper sounds damning.
<p>
On a personal level, I realized just a couple of years ago, <i>after</i> being directed to Foster Chapel and seeing the memorial to her murder site, that I knew Jessica Lynn Keen.  She was fifteen and I was eleven, so to me she seemed practically a grown woman.  I know I had a little-boy crush on her.  My mom and I used to pass her in the mornings as she waited for her ride--the boyfriend, I think.  I was being driven to elementary school or maybe going to meet the bus, and she was often there, hugging her books to her knees as she waited on the breezeway steps at our apartment complex.

<br>
After it happened I recall hearing that a girl from our immediate area had been found dead in a cemetery, naked except for socks--both indelible details to me.  I even figured out later on that it had been the girl from the breezeway who always waited for her ride to pull into the parking lot.  But it took me until after I'd had this website a few years before I put one and one and one together and figured it all out.
<p>
She always smiled at me, and I thought she was beautiful.  I wasn't involved in her life at all, but it seems to me that she got a very raw deal from some parents who didn't know how to react to normal teenage rebellion.  According to what they all say, she was a "cheerleader and honor student" until an eighteen-year-old boyfriend caused her to start skipping school and stop paying attention to her grades.  She couldn't have had very long to rebel (and for God's sake, how many of us did so much more and just kept on going when we were fifteen-sixteen?) before her parents had her placed in a "group home for troubled teens" on March 4, 1991.
<p>
That must have been bad.  The fights and recriminations were bad enough, no doubt, but being packed away by your own family like that...it's ugly.  Then she kept up with the boyfriend, no doubt forced to rely on him even more.  On the fifteenth she had an argument with <i>him</i>--not her partner of many years, not her true love, but just the high school boyfriend who must have felt to her like the only one left on her side.  She must have felt very alone that day, getting on the bus to go to the mall downtown.  It must have been a cold, sad day for her.  And, though I didn't know her at all, really, it breaks my fucking heart to think that a monster happened along and put her through something truly <i>unthinkable</i>, just when she must have been feeling so lonely, so low.  What a world, huh?
<p>
As I said, we'll keep track of Mr. Smith's trial and/or sentencing.  In other news...

If you deal with abandoned buildings and very old graveyards, you're inevitably going to see the places you enjoy the most either demolished (which is terrible) or renovated (which is better, though it nearly always robs the place of its cool ambience).  Worst of all, there seems to be no way to prevent vandals from destroying the best of the little-known historic artifacts I profile on this website--particularly the "haunted" ones.  Some people (property owners in particular) have made the argument that I owe them the favor of not publicizing their supposedly-haunted houses (or roads, barns, fields, etc.) so the curious sightseeker types will leave them alone.  As much as I sympathize, I can't see doing that, because the vast majority of people aren't out there destroying things, and even if they are, I'm just reporting about places and legends that are already making the rounds; if I didn't do it, someone else would, or word of mouth would do the job.  Vandalism happens, though, and it's always depressing to have to report on it when it does.  Which is why this update is full of news, but not much of it is good.

First of all, there's the recent destruction at <a href = "../Woodland/woodland.html">Woodland Cemetery</a>.  Johnny Morehouse, the legend goes, fell into the undrained Miami & Erie Canal in the dead of winter less than a year before the Civil War began.  His pet dog tried to save him, even waiting at his bedside while he succumbed, before finally dying of exposure because he refused to leave the spot where his boy was buried.  Now Johnny and his loyal pet dog are reunited in death, their ghosts roaming Dayton's largest cemetery while a specially built grave marker depicts the dog caring for Johnny Morehouse.
<p>
Well, at some point in late March of 2008, some lovely people came into the graveyard with a hacksaw and chopped the head off the stone dog.  Here's a comparison, with photos taken in 2003 and 2008:

It's not just a shame--it's depressing.  And it happens all the time.  Examples that come to mind include the "Death Angel" of <a href = "../Counties/Erie/maplegrove.html">Maple Grove Cemetery</a> in Vermilion, which was decapitated by similar assholes several years ago and then removed by the cemetery, as well as <a href = "../Counties/Coshocton/coshocton.html">Coshocton County Cemetery</a> in West Lafayette, which has been so trashed by vandals that you can't find the Stockum family plot which the ghost stories center around.  Sometime in the eighties the very last signs of <a href = "../Counties/Athens/simms.html">Simms Cemetery</a> were destroyed by drunken Ohio University students to the point that it's impossible to even know when you're in the graveyard; all the tombstones are gone and it's just a slight clearing in the woods at this point.
<p>
As if that weren't enough, after all the demolition we've seen of our fair state's hideously beautiful crumbling relics, arguably the most impressive of them all is now slated for demolition.  <a href = "../Chippewa/chippewa.html">Chippewa Lake Amusement Park</a> is now slated for demolition in a serious way.  Most likely it will commence sometime in June.  So if you'd like to photograph one of Ohio's very last abandoned roller coasters and ferris wheels, you'd better get to Medina County in the next couple of weeks--no kidding.
<p>
Plenty of updates have been developed and scanned and organized into folders, but my big problem is an inability to identify the places.  So I've revived...

Abandoned Industrial Building; Grain or Food Processing?

East Fifth Avenue near Hamilton Road - Columbus, Ohio

<br>
Too long to really capture in one photograph, this closed-down plant was an interesting find several years ago.  So it might not be there anymore.  If you know it, or remember it, please let me know what it was.  Inside it's full of catwalks and big corrugated pipes, as well as dust and leftover grain ankle-deep.  At one point I remembered what one of the signs said and it gave me a name, but none of the photographs wound up including the sign, so I'm left without much of a clue--other than the fact that I know that food processing or storage of some kind went on there.  The grains were kept in bins side-by-side.  Any help would be appreciated.  Next update I have a type of building that has stumped my ignorant self for years, so I hope you're keeping your brains sharp.  Thanks, as always for the help.

Finally, yes, it's my annual birthday update.  And I'm not 30 yet.  The less said about it, the better.  Now I have to go weep uncontrollably for a few hours.
