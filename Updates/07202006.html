Well, folks, things have been pretty rough and untidy in my world lately, and I haven't had a chance to do much with the site.  I did add a couple of hauntings:  the <a href = "../Counties/Lucas/commodore.html">Commodore Perry Building</a> in Toledo, <a href = "../Counties/VanWert/apartments.html">Haunted Apartments</a> in Van Wert, and the <a href = "../Counties/VanWert/convoy.html">Convoy Heller House</a> in Middlebury.
<p>
But I mainly wanted to post enrollment information for my classes at Zane State College.  The three of them can be signed up for as part of Zane State's summer program, and they cost just $20; that is to say, you can attend one without needing to attend any of the others.  Right now only the first is available to sign up for, but the others should be opening to registrations soon enough.  Each one will be a three-hour workshop covering all facets of our weird state.
<p>
The first class is:

At any rate, it should be a good time, and I hope to see some people from the website there.  And please bring your own local legends, ghost stories, and forgotten places to add to the discussion.
<p>
Here are the other two classes, to be held in the fall:

I also want to mention my good friend Mandi's site, which isn't Forgotten Ohio-related but is certainly a cool personal website.  Mandi and I have been close ever since we worked together on the 2004 presidential election, and she's a beautiful and charming girl and a fun person besides.  Here's her site:  <a href = "http://www.redheadshavemorefun.com/">RedheadsHaveMoreFun.com</a>.
<p>
Anyway, short update.  I'll be back with more soon.  Take care.
