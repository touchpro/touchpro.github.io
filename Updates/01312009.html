My good friend Kristin Carter died sometime in the early morning hours of January 10, 2009.  She deserves mention on Forgotten Ohio because she helped make it what it is.  From the time I first met her back in 2002 she and I were frequently out exploring, particularly obscure cemeteries and haunted places in and around her home city of Dayton.  She gave me solid, well-researched information on a dozen or more hauntings listed on this website.  Moreover, she supplied me with endless stacks of personally taken photographs, pictures she had gone out of her way to take just for me.  One section in particular that Kristin make possible is the exploration of <a href = "../Woodland/woodland.html">Woodland Cemetery</a>.
<p>
But first and foremost, always, Kristin was my friend.  We hung out socially, and she helped me in more ways than I can begin to list here.  It's hard to be anything but bitter and heartsick over the loss of someone at the age of 35.  Apparently she got very sick the night before; the verdict isn't in, but it might have been a bad infection.  She leaves behind three small children, the eldest of whom, Cora, I knew well and enjoyed playing with when I'd visit.
<p>
Sometimes they trot out the platitudes when there's a death, but my feelings about my friend Kristin would have been stated the same way had I been asked in December.  She was perhaps the kindest, most selfless friend I had.  Her remains were cremated.  At her memorial service on the 24th they exhibited a collage of photos and mementos celebrating her life.  This was one:

<br>
To me, this is heartrending beyond words.  She <i>was</i> a peaceful, beautiful person who deserved everything good in life after all she'd done for others, and I only regret that I wasn't able to see her more in the last year.
<p>
It wasn't long ago that my friend <a href = "../erik.html">Erik Rothlisberger</a> died suddenly from causes which were never determined.  Like Erik, Kristin was responsible for so much quality material on Forgotten Ohio that it would be wrong of me not to note her passing on the website.  She was a big fan of the subject and loved the site; she used to really kick my ass about falling behind on the updates.  (So you can imagine, she kicked my ass a lot.)
<p>
Usually, everyone stays anonymous (or as anonymous as possible) on these pages, but Kristin Carter deserves to be credited, thanked, and remembered on Forgotten Ohio.  So I've created a memorial page dedicated to her.  Here it is:

I don't mean to bring everyone down.  We all deal with things like this from time to time, I know.  Forgive the interruption.  But I would never let this happen without making some comments about  how important Kristin was, is, and always will be.  The world is a worse place because she is gone.

I just returned from four days in Washington, DC, staying with my uncle and aunt there and heading into the city every day to take part in the inaugural festivities.  January 20, Inauguration Day itself, was unlike anything I've seen, though the madness of downtown Chicago and Grant Park in particular on November 4, 2008 came close.  It was worth the hour-long wait for a Metro train in order to say I was there for both major chapters in this historic American moment.  So yes, you should be jealous.
<p>
More relevant than anything else so far, I want to offer a sneak preview of my latest exploration.  It's a building I've seen from afar for several years and always wondered about.  I finally parked and checked it out firsthand this past week.  Thanks to the identification of the <a href = "../Landmark/landmark.html">Landmark Grain Elevator</a> in a recent update I know that it's the same kind of thing, but beyond that I'm not sure what to call it or any of the specifics of its history or function.
<p>
So consider this another installment of...

<br>
I'm not sure it's technically in Huber Heights, but that's the last exit before you hit I-675 if you're heading west on I-70.  If you take 675 South, and look off to your right as you begin to merge, you'll see this towering, double-silo concrete behemoth.

Even from a distance you can tell it's quite abandoned.  All the doors and windows are missing, giving it that haunted look we find so appealing for whatever reason.  Can anyone tell me more about this apparent grain elevator complex northeast of Dayton?  A name would be great, but any other details are wonderful to have.  Thank you, as always, for your help.
<p>
With my glorious new camera equipment I'm able to produce fresh updates from new locations like this all the time, so check back often for more and more breand new stuff.  And thanks for your patience with what has been a very personal update.
