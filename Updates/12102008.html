I was busy during the final days of the election--a mountain of work culminating in a long roadtrip to Chicago, where I was actually able to be in Grant Park the night America's first black president gave his victory speech--ground zero for one of the three or four most historic events of my life.  It was pretty incredible.
<p>
I know, I know--not everyone is going to agree, and many people will be left feeling genuinely alienated by me talking about supporting this guy over the other guy, and so on and so forth.  Why talk politics when you can leave the subject completely alone and no one will miss it at all?  This isn't a political website, right?  Why ostracize so many people?
<p>
I must add that, have I offended anyone, I do sincerely apologize.  I can't help being excited, and I can't help thinking that even someone who voted for McCain (a guy I respect tremendously, by the way, both for his service and his relative honesty--either way our country would have been better off for the change in White House occupancy) must be able to appreciate what a watershed moment this is for our nation, and how much respect we've regained around the world.  Travelling with the campaign I met dozens of foreign correspondents (I think I've been on the news in Canada, Great Britain, Greece, Colombia, and Sweden, by the way) and they made it clear that an Obama win does wonders for our standing in the eyes of every other nation on earth.  I mean, we've got a cool President again, don't we?

So...with that said, I guess I'll move on to more relevant matters.
<p>
First there's the Name That Building thing, and the numerous answers I got explaining to my stupid self that yes, it's a GRAIN ELEVATOR.  Not hard to figure out, I supposed.  Being a city kid I never knew that a grain elevator was anything other than one of those tall, phallic things with the domed tops you see next to a farmer's barn--you know, a silo.  But I never claimed to know anything.  I rely on people with actual intelligence to fill me in--people like Mike Kincaid of Pataskala, and particularly last update's uniquely informative correspondent Tim Chrismer, who apparently has a Google search engine for a brain.  Very impressive, and thanks.

Landmark Grain Elevator

<br>
Archer Daniels Midland / Main and Nelson, LLC

</center>
<br>
Previously owned by agribusiness megacorporatio Archer Daniels Midland ("The Supermarket to the World"), ADM sold it to a limited-liability corporation called "Main and Nelson."  (My guess is it's so they can have it knocked down.)  I'll let Tim Chrismer show off his encyclopedic knowledge here, rather than summarize inadequately:
<p>
<font color = "yellow">
"It is a grain elevator - typically used to store grain, sold by
farmers, until it can be loaded onto railroad cars and shipped to its
destination. This is a rather large elevator complex, having a capacity
of over 2 million bushels - enough to fill over 400 railroad hopper
cars. A bushel is about 55-60 pounds of corn, soybeans or wheat, so this
facility will hold about 60,000 tons of grain. ADM still owns the grain
elevator complex on Groves Road west of Hamilton Road (visible just
south of I-70) which has a 4.4 million bushel capacity. These
facilities, judging by their size and location and the fact that there
seems to be no way to unload grain from trucks, are not intended for
farmers to truck their grain in to sell, but are instead used to store
large amounts of grain, brought in by rail, until it can be sold for a
good price. It is then loaded back into rail cars and shipped out. At
least that's my theory.
<p>
"The grain silos, each 80 - 120 feet tall, were built in four stages, or
batteries, in 1919, 1939, 1954 and 1960. The other buildings on the site
were built at various times as early as 1904 and as recent as 1980. I'm
not sure what the large white tanks would be used for - I've never seen
them at any other grain elevator complexes."<font color = "white">
<p>
So there you have it.  My photos of this remarkable abandoned behemoth are fairly limited, I'm sorry to say, because my friend Hoss and I climbed it at night and my photos didn't come out; the flash doesn't reach far enough inside spacious, high-ceilinged rooms or on the exterior of large structures.  I'm putting together a small exploration page for it anyway, however, and should have it done and posted within the next couple of days.  Same with the Agri-Care Fertilizer Manufacturing plant (yum, huh?), which was ID'ed for me last time around.  I'm actually working on it.
<p>
The hardest thing about creating new updates right now is that I don't have a real camera.  I've done some work with disposables (which work surprisingly well), but obviously I'm sad about pretty damn decent camera malfunctioning, apparently for good.  Do you think I could have it fixed easily at Cord Camera, or maybe Ritz, or a place like that?  It might just need some kind of rebooting, though I've tried that a little.  You see, I'm old-fashioned and I adhere to the 35mm cameras, even though I don't have one of those big Nikon units with various interchangeable telephoto lenses and filters and adjustable shutter speeds and everything.  I've never had anything nicer than a cool, sleek little snap-open pocket camera (which took some great photos), and then the one I used until it broke about a months ago, which cost me $70 at Target in 2003.  Now I find that they don't really sell cameras like that anymore, because digital has taken over.
<p>
I'm wary about digital photography because when I first started Forgotten Ohio (remember, this website is ancient by internet standards; it's about to celebrate it's TENTH anniversary in the spring) they often didn't take high-enough quality photos, in general, for my tastes.  Scanning good-quality hard copies worked much better for me, and it had the added benefit of leaving me with a carefully indexed collection of hard copies to provide to my editors when newspaper and magazine articles came out--and, ultimately, made illustrating my books far easier.  I know some 1998 digital cameras that captured nothing better than a medium-resolution JPEG, and publishers need at least high-quality TIFFs.  Hard copies are always a good thing to have.
<p>
Now, however, I know that digital cameras can take photos of the highest quality, and they can provide color prints equal to those I get back from the one-hour photo.  The problem is, they're really expensive.  I'd love to get one of those really nice cameras, get some lessons on how to take the best photos, and just upload them directly and print them if I need to.  Something just good enough, say with no more than an adjustable zoom, would be perfect as well, and would enable me to do a lot more work for the site.  But I can't afford a few hundred dollars right now, so I'm hoping to find a reasonably decent-quality 35mm camera with an adjustable zoom.  Developing the film is no problem, no matter how stone age it might be--but it seems they've nearly stopped selling new 35mm cameras of any quality, replacing them with an all-digital selection.
<p>
Does anybody have a decent camera they'd be willing to sell?  Like I said, the kind of solid little thing you'd put in a purse or take on vacation, not necessarily anything fancy.  Otherwise, have you heard of anything that still takes 35mm being sold, new, in someplace like Target?  I just thought I'd ask.  Camera problems have prevented me from photographing a bunch of wonderful sites I've come across in the past few months.  But don't worry, it'll get resolved soon enough.
<p>
Halloween happened since my last update.  I hope yours was fun and scary and all that good stuff.  Mine was all of that, as well as busy.  During that time I was interviewed for "haunted Ohio" stories by the <a href = "http://www.toledoblade.com/">Toledo <i>Blade</i></a>, as well as two radio stations in NE Ohio.  The first was an all-nighter (1AM-5AM) on <a href = "http://www.wcsb.org/">WCSB</a>, Cleveland State, in-studio, hosted by the very amusing and talented Orin.  Before the show he accompanied me on a tour of various downtown Cleveland haunts, photos of which will show up here before long.  That was broadcast in the early morning hours of October 21.  Then, on October 30, I was a morning show phone guest on <a href = "http://www.mix941.com/">Mix 94.1</a> Canton/Akron/Cleveland.  The <i>Blade</i> interview was conducted by my old friend Angie Schmitt, who remembered me despite her journalistic rise to prominence with a major urban daily.  (I remember her when she was a lowly political operative in the 2004 election.)
<p>
Finally, embarassingly, we come to...

A Plea for (Another) Favor
<font color = "white" size = 4>
</center>
<br>
I love everyone who follows the site, writes to me, corresponds with me, discusses the site elsewhere, or simply uses it to help them break the law with added enthusiasm.  And I hate to ask for favors--though, okay, I do it a lot.  This one is important, though, so I must lower myself and ask:
<p>
I need someone who is either a current student at Ohio State, or who graduated in the last year or two, to contact me so I can ask you for a small favor.  I'm not begging money, or sex, or drugs.  (Though reasonable offers will be considered.)  It's actually not a big deal, but it does involve some small imposition.  So...OSU people, please send me an e-mail at <a href = "mailto:andy@forgottenoh.com">andy@forgottenoh.com</a>, if you would, please.  Thank you.
