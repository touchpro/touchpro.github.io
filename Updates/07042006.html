Independence Day

<br>
The United States turns 230 today, and there are fireworks everywhere when you drive around after dark.  Last night my own city had its annual "Red, White & Boom," an event I have not attended since I was in middle school--though I was driving straight down the deserted, mostly blocked-off I-71 at just the right time to watch the whole thing from my car two or three summers ago.  It's a very cool time of year, sort of an unofficial middle of summer, though really it's only two weeks after summer starts.  Public school schedules have irreversibly screwed up our perception of summer as a season.
<p>
Now that it's getting closer, I should mention, yet again, my speaking engagement at the <a href = "http://www.new-carlisle.lib.oh.us/"><b><font size = 5>New Carlisle Public Library<font size = 4></b></a>, 111 E. Lake Ave. in New Carlisle, Clark County, on <b><font size = 5>Thursday, July 13<font size = 4></b> at <b><font size = 5>6:30PM<font size = 4></b>.  A good time will be had by all, I'm sure, though I have a sneaking suspicion that one day I'm going to be killed by an angry property owner at one of these things.
<p>
Speaking of public appearances where I might be killed, I've now met with the program coordinator at <a href = "http://www.zanestate.edu/">Zane State College</a> and established the dates, titles, and formats of the classes I'll be conducting there.  They're more workshops than actual classes, three hours long in each case, and can be attended individually or in total.  Enrollment is the only detail not thoroughly worked out at this point.  The classes are as follows:

<br>
As I said, the procedure for enrollment hasn't been settled upon yet, but that should change shortly, and I'll post the information here as soon as I have it.  If you're wondering what the classes will be like, I'm trying to set up a kind of participatory workshop, something making use of everyone's knowledge of their local history and legends.  I'm also interested in having an in-depth discussion of research techniques for difficult topics like these (for instance, looking up the history of a particular, ordinary house) and I think these workshops will be, at the very least, a lot more fun than your average dry history lecture.  I'll begin filling in the details for each specific class in the next couple of days, as the lesson plans I'm working on develop further.
<p>
So, on to today's website updates.  First, there's a lot more to be found in Richland County, thanks to the contributions of Brett J. Mitchell.  Brett is the author of the booklet <i>Bandits, Stalkers, & Murder:  Life of the Tetched Phoebe Wise</i>, details of which can be found at <a href = "http://www.historicalpreservation.org/phoebe/">www.historicalpreservation.org/phoebe</a>.  He sent me a copy of his work, along with a disk containing a number of images and meticulously researched news clippings, all concerning the life of this notorious Mansfield eccentric and hermit.  Phoebe's life was pretty incredible; not only was she tortured by burglars seeking a nonexistent family fortune in the walls of her crumbling house (two of whom later escaped from jail), she was the victim of a violent stalker whom she eventually killed with a Winchester rifle by putting one .32 caliber round through the door of her house and into his right lung.  Later in life she was pestered by more burglars, as well as local people who thought she was a witch, and became something of a local celebrity before she died in 1933.  This is a picture of her from late in life:

<br>
Kinda scary, huh?  What makes her particularly relevant to the website is that she is the well-known <a href = "../Counties/Richland/reformatoryrd.html">Ghost of Reformatory Road</a>, the hunched old woman sometimes seen making her way up and down the road beside the also-quite-haunted <a href = "../OSR/osr.html">Ohio State Reformatory</a>.  The section has been expanded to include the more thorough and accurate historical details collected and generously contributed by Brett Mitchell.
<p>
Two new links to add as well.  First there's <a href = "http://www.remarkableohio.org">Remarkable Ohio</a>, a website seemingly dedicated to an analysis of Ohio history by exploring the sites marked with those metal historical plaques.  It's a surprisingly professional and informative website.  Secondly, I was flattered to discover a photography group on the image-hosting server Flickr named after and "loosely" inspired by my website.  Click on it to see the amazing places people with actual photographic talent have explored:  <a href = "http://www.flickr.com/groups/forgottenohio/">Flickr:  Forgotten Ohio</a>.
<p>
I know how shocking this must be, but I am <i>still</i> working on my next book, which has turned out to be quite a bit of writing work in the second and third draft stages, so I've had less time to update the website itself than I'd prefer.  I have, however, kept up pretty nicely with e-mails.  So, send me one if there's something on your mind.  I plan to start posting questions, comments, and complaints on this page beginning with the next update.  Also in store for the next update is something I've been wondering how to handle for a long time now:  abandoned buildings, forgotten places, and weird ruins I've explored and photographed without having the slightest idea what they are or what to call them.  On more than one occasion this has prevented me from adding fairly cool abandoned spots to the website, since "Unidentified Brick Buildings" makes for such a shitty title.  Hopefully someone will know what a few of these places are.  At the very least they'll get an exhibition.
<p>
Happy Fourth of July.
