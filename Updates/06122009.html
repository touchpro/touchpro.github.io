Another exterior-only page today, worth checking out for the amazing way the building presents itself, but obviously lacking the interior exploration pages.  They are coming soon.  Until then, enjoy the images that mysteriously disappeared from the previous update page (when I transferred them to an appropriate folder but forgot to redirect the image source HTML; just one of the sloppy hazards of coding your own low-tech website)...Pondexter Tower.

Poindexter Tower</a>

Poindexter was one of the nation's original housing projects, built around 1960 on a then-much-nicer Mount Vernon Avenue, part of Columbus's near east side.  Like Cabrini Green in Chicago and New York's notorious Kennedy Projects, Poindexter followed a slumping economy into a state of barely-functional ruin in the 1970s, then experienced drug-fueled mayhem through the 1980s as crack emerged and national drug policy simplified itself into a "war" on addicts and the nuanced genius of "Just Say No."

Daniel Dudzinski and returning champion Tim Chrismer lent me a big hand in researching the background of this hollowed-out residential tower, so I want to thank them.  As I said, click on the <a href = "../Poindexter/poindexter.html">Poindexter Tower</a> page itself for full details and, eventually, an interior exploration of the place.  If the rumors are true, it won't be long before the place is flattened to make way for a rubble-strewn vacant lot.
The "Forgotten Neighborhoods" section has turned out to be a popular concept, and I've received many tips which will help immensely as I travel the state and photograph our cities' worst parts of town. I'll construct a baner and add it as a major section of the site very soon.

Since I was last on here, some difficult things happened which kept me away from the computer.  First, I turned the very difficult age of 30 on May 12.  I know, I know; it's not old, I've never thought of it as old, don't sweat the small stuff.  But I really can't help it.  There's something about the inexorable way our odometers do manage to turn over that really gets me--but I've always been fatalistic about aging.  I remember hating 20.  This one actually depressed me, and I've not typically a depressive person.  Then I came down with the flu, spent days recuperating in bed, and slept the Ny-Quil sleep more than half the time.  When I finally did recover from that, it was like the sun had come back out, and I managed to shed my self-pitying birthday blues (though I'm still coming to terms with my new age).
<p>
More to come, as usual.  Hopefully I'll have a good sample Forgotten Neighborhoods section laid out for discussion and improvement before very long at all.
<p>
So...guys can still be young and attractive in their 30s, right?  Somebody reassure me!
