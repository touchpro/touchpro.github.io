Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.  Shocking though it may be, I still exist and love this website and have even done a respectable amount of work for it.  That work has not, however, included posting an update since I was two years younger.  
<p>
Negligence of this kind creates all kinds of awkwardness.  For example:  Several of the locations I've visited and documented are now <i>gone</i>.  I'll still post them, but it pains me that they're no longer around.  One such place is today's update.
<p>
The <a href = "../HoJo/hojo.html">Howard Johnson's Hotel</a> was a lovely ruin on Hamilton Road in east Columbus--until mid-2013.  Back in March of that year I made the last of three tours of the place, which you can view <a href = "../HoJo/hojo.html">here</a>.  The overgrown courtyard is a particular highlight.

I would promise more updates soon to come, but why would anyone believe me?  I'll just have to prove it.  I do apologize for the ridiculous hiatus.

I'm on Facebook; so are you.  It's the law.  Please do check out the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Forgotten-Ohio-wwwforgottenohcom/10150098583100072">Forgotten Ohio Group</a>; I didn't create it, but it's amazing and contains material by me and others, and plenty of stuff not found on the website.
<p>
And I'm long overdue in posting my personal Facebook info.  Here it is, soon to be attached to every page below my e-mail address:
