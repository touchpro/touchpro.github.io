An interesting house on the desolate west side of South High, this place has been abandoned for as long as I can remember.  It stands next to a Buy Here Pay Here car lot, and has No Trespassing signs posted prominently.  There's lots of rotten junk inside what was once a damn nice house, but the most interesting thing is the nasty, swampy pond out back.  That sign halfway down the slope says "GOD'S WORLD."  An e-mail I got informed me that up until the early 80's or so, there was a much bigger house next to this one, roughly where the car lot stands today.  Apparently it was much creepier.  Today this is all that's left.
