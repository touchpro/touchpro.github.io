This is about my grand mother Helen ragsdale it started when she 
passed 
in 1980 i was 8 yrs old. my grandfather owned his own business in steel 
fabrication they owned a modest house in town when my grandmother 
passed her 
room was in the rear of the house when ever i had to go to the bathroom 
it 
would face her room and i would get this feeling that my grand mother 
was 
sitting on the bed this went on for as long as he owned the house! my 
grandfather remarried in 1981 he had all the locks changed do to a 
robbery in 
his house no one had any keys. my grand father kept a picture of my 
grandmother in the top drawer he had left for work and when he came 
home that 
evening the picture was on the top of the dresser no one was home he 
just 
placed  it back in the drawer and went about his business well a few 
days 
later this happened again he repeated the same thing he just placed it 
back 
in the drawer well it happened one more time and the picture has never 
been 
seen again i think my grandmother was telling my grandfather not to 
forget 
her. and a few other things went on like when i was in the rear of the 
house 
a music box would play and when i left the room it would stop! i always 
felt 
her in that house she was a great lady and i miss her very much and the 
last 
thing she reached out to me in a dream i was sitting in a white room 
she was 
sitting across from me talking and smiling but i could not hear what 
she was 
saying but it was when I was 25 when the dream happened! 
<p>
Extra note my 
grandfather moved out of the house in the mid 90s and me and my mother 
returned to the house after they had moved and my grandmother was no 
longer 
there she had chosen to move on I guess which is fine with me she was 
at 
peace I hope!
