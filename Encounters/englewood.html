I'm writing to you to tell of my experience at Englewood dam.  I 
like to 
walk the trails that go through the woods, and run along the river.  A 
few 
years ago I was walking the trail in the morning.  I was down by the river when I was startled by a young woman that looked very odd.
<p> 
She was about 5" 2', and petite.  She was pale, and wore a black cape.  This 
is odd enough, but her movements got me to look even more.  She walked very 
creepy and 
slow. As i got close to her, she moved off the trail and walked into a 
bunch of bushes and covered her body in a standing crouch.  Usually people on 
that 
trail will at least make some acknowledgment, but she didn't do 
anything.  She 
was like a zombie.  I walked past her about ten yards, puzzled, and feeling 
the 
feeling I got in my former house, which was haunted.  
<p>
I turned to watch her some more, but 
when I turned  around, there was nothing.  There was no time for anything to go 
out of 
sight.  This is a hilly trail, and she would have made a big sound if 
she'd moved that fast.  
<p>
Anyway, this scared me, but I never talked about it 
with 
anyone. Then a year later, after becoming a paramedic, my partner and I
were 
killing some time between runs, and I told her my story, in detail.  Then out of the blue she says that the little girl roams the other side of dam in a white cape.  She then told me a story about her 
experience.  It was hauntingly the same tale.  She told me a young girl 
was killed down by the river years ago, and that it was her I had seen.
<p>
Well, to make the story even more creepy...I have a friend who talks with ghosts and does some amazing things with them in front of me.  I told him 
that I had seen a ghost at the dam.  That's all I said, was I had seen a ghost.  He then tells me 
detail by detail about what I had seen.  I never told him anything but the word 
ghost.  He then tells me about seeing the girl I had seen years prior as 
a boy.  I have read that there is a haunting in that area, but i have no idea 
if this is the same haunting.

Cool stuff.  This sounds like a ghost which is well-known in the area.
