A ghost story about the kind of pristine abandoned ghost house you usually only see in the movies.

The house was built in 1896. I assume the folks that built it were relatively wealthy as it was piped for gaslights and all the fireplaces in the house are gas. The woodwork is all oak and the fireplace hearths all have ceramic tile. It sat vacant for about twenty years.

My sister fell in love with it and decided she needed to see the inside. So she and her husband set about breaking in. They thought it would be easy as there are quite a few abandoned houses in Senecaville and the local delinquents use them as hang outs. They were surprised to discover the house was still locked up tight. They finally managed to get in through the basement and upstairs where another surprise awaited. The house was completely unvandalized. There was no sign that anyone had been in the house since it was closed up. They found out later that the reason was the houses' reputation for being haunted.
<p>
Anyway, my sister found the owner and asked how much he wanted for the house. They bought it on land contract and after the sale, began to work on it. Not sure when all this transpired but it was before 1994. The first story is about my sister. She was in the house one evening, upstairs peeling wallpaper in the master bedroom. She heard the door open and footsteps coming in and across the floor. She heard the footsteps come up the stairs and then stop. She called out, thinking it was her husband but got no answer. She got up and investigated and found noone in the house but herself. She and her husband heard other noises but most of them were chalked up to raccoons in the attic. The next story happened in 1994 after my oldest brother died. He was hit by lightning while helping me try to save my other brothers' stepsons' dog. He had helped my sister on the house alot and had painted the outside. The evening of the day he died my nephew said he came into his (nephews) room and sat on the bed and talked to him. My nephew said he told him to tell us he was okay and not to worry or be sad. (hard to tell this, still) A few weeks after this, my brother in law was working alone in the house at night. He was stripping wallpaper from the wall along the stairs. He felt like someone was watching him and turned and saw my brother leaning against the pillar in the front room watching him. My brother in law immediately faced the wall again and stood facing it for quite a while. Finally he turned again and my brother was still there watching him. My bro in law said he smiled at him. My bro turned and faced the wall again and waited. Turned around at last and my brother was gone. He sat on the stairs for a while and finally went home. After that, he didn't work on the house alone at night. A few weeks after this, my sister, her husband, a friend of her husbands', and my younger nephew (he was 2-3 yrs old at the time) were sitting in the unfinished dining room on upended 5 gallon buckets and talking. My nephew began to point toward the other end of the room and say, "There's Uncle Tim" (my brother} Of course when they looked they saw nothing. My nephew got mad and said," Aren't you going to say hi to him? He's right there." (very precocious child) My sister was really rattled by that one. Since then, my oldest nephew has seen someone upstairs come out of the kids room and go down the hall. My sister has felt cold spots and they have all heard footsteps. Most recently, my sister saw a full bodied apparition go through the living room and into the computer room. She thought it was my nephew at first but when she went into the room, noone was there.

I have stayed in that house any number of times and haven't seen a darned thing. Guess I'm not open minded enough. Still, I don't like walking around it at night with the lights off.

Most abandoned places don't have anything good in them--with a few notable exceptions.  This house sounds like a good candidate.  Plus it has ghosts.  This story comes from a reliable source, too, so I trust it more than average.
