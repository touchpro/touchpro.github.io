A compelling story from the University of Akron, sent to me recently.
<br>

<font color = "yellow">
I lived in off-campus housing while attending Akron U, in an old house 
on
Sherman Street that was broken up into six apartments.  Mine was in the 
back
of the house on the second floor-not a bad place, relatively close to
campus, cheap rent, clean, private interior staircase entrance, good
landlady.  I lived here in from '87 to end of summer of '89, sharing 
the
place with one other girl.  I noticed nothing until I had brought in a
replacement for a graduating roommate, and the first thing was what I 
called
the "foot-bone" sounds- snapping noises that would cross the floor.  
This
sound would go right past me as I sat in a doorway.  No big deal, and 
it did
not bother my cat. I thought it could be an old-house noise caused by 
the
upstairs neighbors walking around, but this was distinctly the sound of
foot-bones cracking and it was on the floor, not the ceiling.  
<p>
About a 
year
later for the first and last time, I saw what I think was making the 
sounds.
It was a Saturday night/Sunday morning in August 1988, and I was alone 
in
the apartment and up late, not getting to bed until after 1AM, and the
neighborhood was quiet.  I woke out of a dead sleep, feeling like 
someone
was staring at me, and I saw a figure framed in my bedroom doorway 
backlit
by the light in the kitchen.  It was male, quite small in stature, 
maybe
5'5" tall and that was including its hat!  This flat-black shape was 
facing
me, making no sounds or movements, wearing a fedora-type hat and a suit 
that
looked like it had shoulderpads.  I lay still and pretended I was 
sleeping,
sure I had fallen asleep without locking my apartment door and was 
about to
suffer some consequences, but not understanding why this "person" 
wasn't
moving or speaking, and not quite processing the fashion statement it 
made
with its hat and suit.  I closed my eyes for what felt like a long time 
and
when I opened them up, the shape was gone.  
<p>
I got out of bed very 
quietly,
grabbed this big glass bottle that sat on my windowsill and prepared to
defend myself if this "person" was still in the apartment.  Nobody was.  
My
cat was just coming back in after prowling around outside, and I had 
indeed
left the door unlocked, so I rounded up the kitty and locked up.  
<p>
Sleep
paralysis?  I was and am a fairly gutsy person, not particulary afraid 
of
confrontation and I absolutely would not have hesitated to go upside an
intruder's head with my big blue blenko bottle, but this visitor had me
terrified.  It was not at all malevolent, nor did it seem particularly
cheery either.  And I felt this scared after reading ghost stories ever
since I could string letters into words??  I was too scared to try and
communicate, and I never saw it again, but I also never went to sleep
without checking to make sure the door was locked.

Very scary.  It makes you wonder whether it was a real person, hallucination, or possibly something else.
