This schoolhouse is located west of Mechanicsburg in Champaign County, near Route 29.  I came across it accidentally while taking the long way from Toledo to London, in the early spring of 2002.  Sometimes you come across cool stuff like this when you skip the freeway.

Stumbling upon a place like this usually leaves me at a loss when it comes to historical data, but the builders of this schoolhouse very considerately embedded an informational plaque near the peak of the roof.  It's not quite legible in the photo above, but I can tell you that it gives the name of the schoolhouse (Wild Rose), the year it was built (1869), and the township it served (Goshen Twp.).  1869 is old for any building in the United States.

The front door of this place was wide open.  Inside it was obvious that there had been a fire.  As you can see, there were still scorched metal desks inside.  It does seem very weird for there still to have been desks inside a tiny schoolhouse like this.  It couldn't have been used for classes very recently.

The term "one room schoolhouse" doesn't really apply to any schoolhouse I've been through, and this one is no exception.  There's a big room up front where the desks are, but the whole floor has four or five rooms.  One in the back contained a shelving unit with jars on it.

There's also a small basement.  When I went downstairs I came across the furnace you see in the picture above.  It looks pretty new to me.  So I suppose somebody occupied this place more recently than the Great Depression.  But what about the desks?  The mystery deepens.

<br>
Not exactly earth-shattering, but still an interesting little place to come across.  And the name of this schoolhouse reminds me of a song I like by Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue called "Where the Wild Roses Go," which is about a murder.
