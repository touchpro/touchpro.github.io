Station One

The first station is the one which most resembles what it originally was.  It consists of a dank and heavily spraypainted concrete platform extending to meet a train which never ran, from a recessed area where commuters could wait.

On the west side of the tunnel, across the water main, the other half of the station still exists.  We couldn't make it across to check that one out.  Well OK, we could have, but we didn't want to duck under that big dripping pipe.

The stairs still lead up to the street, but are blocked off with a slab of concrete.
