Rain Rock is located in Fallsbury Township, Licking County, and is marked by a field full of big boulders.  As somebody observed a century or so ago, it looks like it rained rocks there.

Apparently at one time Rain Rock was a town, although it never had a post office.  It was also used as a meeting place for churches and family gatherings up until about the 1930s, from what I hear.  Rain Rock's name may come from the boulders, but it's also likely that an old cave nearby contributed to the naming.  The cave apparently sits beneath a spring, and it always appears to be raining inside.  Today the cave has been sealed up, but for a long time it was a popular local attraction.  The picture below was sent to me by someone who grew up in the area.

Rain Rock is, appropriately enough, located on Rainrock Road, just down from the Falling Rock Campground, and some farmer owns the field.  He probably thought it was pretty strange for me to stop and stand on the roof of my car to take pictures of his rocks.
