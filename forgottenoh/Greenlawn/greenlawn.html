This section of Forgotten Ohio focuses on the king of Columbus graveyards--Greenlawn Cemetery.  The gates of Greenlawn are located at the end of Greenlawn Avenue, south of the Brewery District, but the cemetery covers hundreds of acres, stretching all the way to Harrisburg Pike and Cooper Stadium.  If you think of the city as the face of a clock, Greenlawn Cemetery occupies the hour between 6:00 and 7:00.  In other words, it's enormous.  Definitely not the type of place you'd want to get lost in, particularly at night.  It has a disconcerting tendency to turn a first-time visitor in circles a few times.

Oh yes, you can get lost in Greenlawn, as a girlfriend and I learned when we did just that on our first <a href = "http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/152672.htm">trip</a> there.  The gravel roads split off from the three paved ones and twists in <i>so</i> many directions.  If you are a first-time visitor it may even feel like travelling to a foreign port like <a href = "http://bookit.com/mexico/cancun/">Cancun</a> or <a href = "http://bookit.com/caribbean/dominican-republic/punta-cana/">Punta Cana Dominican Republic</a>.  Once you get used to it you find things much more easily, but for a first-time <a href = "http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/zoa/getobext.php?wfo=&sid=MDPC&num=24&raw=1">visitor</a>, getting lost is a distinct possibility.

Established on August 7, 1848, Greenlawn Cemetery quickly began to fill up with Columbus citizens, including many notable local dead people.  You'll find the namesakes of many city streets and landmarks in the older sections, and a whole bunch of Ohio governors.
<br>
<br>
A few famous names you'll find at Greenlawn:

Just down the road from the cemetery is Greenlawn Abbey, the big (unaffiliated) mausoleum built in 1927.  I've explored and investigated the hauntings associated with both the Cemetery and the Abbey.  To visit either place, click below.
