Located just south of Route 22 on Otterbein Road in Perry County is Otterbein Cemetery, home to a locally renowned haunted site:  the horseshoe grave.  Legends vary, but the basics are as follows:  someone--possibly Mary Henry, to whom the stone belongs, possibly her husband--was killed when a horse kicked him or her in the head.  In some versions the husband was kicked after Mary committed suicide when she discovered his infidelity; in others the horse was startled into kicking her in the head, murdering her to get her out of the way so he could marry someone else.  Either way, after that the "bloody" horseshoe imprint appeared on the back of Mary's tombstone, a reminder of what had been done to her.  Legend has it that the stain is impossible to scrub off.  It's also said that if you visit on certain nights you can hear the beat of horse hooves on the road nearby.
A guy I met told me that he went to the cemetery one night and was chased off by a mysterious blue light which both he and his friend saw.

One night in late July of 2000 I visited Otterbein Cemetery with Hoss.  It's not hard to find; just look for Otterbein Road, just west of Somerset.  The graveyard is beside a church.
<BR>
<BR>
We parked in the gravel lot beside the church and in front of a small home set off the road.  When we got out a beagle dog ran up and greeted us.  When we reached out to pet him he flinched, though, which is a pretty good indicator that whatever shithead owns him probably beats him.

The dog went with us over to the cemetery, which slopes down a mild hill and is bordered on two sides by trees and high weeds.  It seemed very well taken care of.  In the very back corner, where the trees and weeds are, the horseshoe grave stands all by itself.

We started toward it.  At this point the dog stopped, spread out, and began barking in the direction of the tombstone.  He didn't seem to want to go any further.  This was pretty scary for a while, but then we called to him a few times and he followed.  He might have been barking at another dog, a few of which we could hear barking off in the distance in people's back yards.

Mary Henry's tombstone has been surrounded with a low metal fence and braced in metal, since people have obviously tried to break it apart for souvenirs.  We looked around at the back and found that there is indeed a horseshoe-shaped stain on the tombstone; it looks sort of like somebody placed a horseshoe there, let it rust, and then removed it.

We hung around for a while and tried to speak to the ghost.  We called it by name.  I even used "in the name of God."  But it didn't show itself.  No blue light emerged, and there was no sound of horses galloping on Otterbein Road.  If the ghost does exist, it doesn't show itself on cue.

It was an interesting thing to see, although I have a sneaking suspicion that the stain on the gravestone came first and the story came later.  Have you ever seen the ghost of Mary Henry or her lover?  If you have, write to me and let me know about it.
