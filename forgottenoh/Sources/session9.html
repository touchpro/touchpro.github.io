If you're interested in abandoned mental hospitals (and really, who isn't?), you've probably seen websites about <a href = "../Ridges/ridges.html">The Ridges</a> and the <a href = "../Broadview/broadview.html">Broadview Developmental Center</a>, among others.  Ohio used to have a whole system of state-run mental hospitals in the Kirbride style in every corner of the state.
<p>
But none of our scary abandoned mental hospitals can hold a candle to the Danvers Hospital in Massachusetts, setting of the truly excellent horror movie <i>Session 9</i>.  Don't be put off by the USA Films distribution logo at the beginning; this is scary stuff all the way through, with an ending that's shocking and well-earned.  It really manages to capture what exactly it is that's so fascinating about these huge, abandoned behemoths--especially in scenes where Stephen Gevedon listens to creepy recordings of patient therapy sessions.  Scary without being melodramatic, surprising without being cliched, <i>Session 9</i> is highly recommended.
