The lobby of the Seneca is still largely intact, although it bears more imprint from the building's days as the Ohio EPA than as a hotel.  It occupies the northwest corner of the building and is separated from the street by offices.  There is a chandelier, a front desk, and a boarded-over glass foyer where the main entrance used to be.

In a lounge area off the main lobby is some nice decoration:  a long bureau backed with a mirror, along with a fireplace.

Just down the hall from the main lobby is a staircase which only goes up one flight.  The door at the top is very securely sealed, which makes us wonder where the hell it goes.  Maybe we'll find out eventually.
