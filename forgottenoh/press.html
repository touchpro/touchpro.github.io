Forgotten Ohio occasionally gets some attention in the press and even wins an award on rare occasions.  Below I have assembled my brushes with minor notoriety in reverse chronological order.

A reporter for the Toledo <i>Blade</i> who is coincidentally a friend of mine, Angie Schmitt, interviewed me for the Halloween 2008 edition of that newspaper.  I'm not certain which day it ran on, and I don't have the article reproduced yet, but it was definitely cool to have been consulted by one of the state's major papers.

On October 30, 2008, I was interviewed by Rik Elliot, the morning show host at Canton's <a href = "http://www.mix941.com/index.php">Mix 94.1 FM</a>.  Very fast-paced, very professional, and fun to do.  Thanks to Rik for having me on the show.

My first four-hour, all-night interview took place from 1-5AM in the earliest part of October 21, 2008.  The very funny and entertaining Orin first accompanied me to some Cleveland-area haunted spots, then conducted the whole thing on-air at <a href = "http://www.wcsb.org/">WCSB 89.3 FM</a>, the Cleveland State University radio station.  Certainly the most interesting all-nighter I've ever done.

On Saturday, October 29, 2005, I was invited for the third time to appear on the Ohio News Network as a Halloween guest, talking about real haunted places around the state.  I talked about the Walker Funeral Home, Greenlawn Cemetery, and the Statehouse, among other places, and plugged my new book as well.  The interview ran during the weekend news all day Saturday and on Sunday, October 30 as well.  I got a lot of hits and great feedback from the appearance; my thanks as always to producer Amy Backus for inviting me on, and to anchor Mike Raymond for conducting the interview.

In March and April of 2005 a half-hour-long interview with me ran many, many times on Educable 25's <i>Skyline Columbus</i>.  This student-produced and student-staffed show is a production of Capital University's <a href = "http://www.capital.edu/acad/as/communication/">Department of Communication</a>.  Each episode is devoted to some facet of life in Columbus, usually an event (the State Fair, Make a Wish), place (Southern Theater, Wexner Center), or person (Jack Hanna, Dino Tripodus) that's interesting or entertaining in some way.  In my case they made an exception and asked me to be the subject of an episode filmed in mid-January.  Before the in-studio interview, producer Kat Sharp accompanied me to a few places featured on the website, including the haunted woods on Old Xenia Road, Walhalla Road, and the Gates of Hell drainage system, and filmed them for the story.  The completed <i>Skyline</i> episode about Forgotten Ohio was wonderful; I couldn't have been happier with the way it came out, or more honored to have been asked to participate.  My thanks to Executive Producer Victor Van Buchem, student producer and editor Kat Sharp, and everyone else involved.

Josie Rubio contacted me for this story and quotes me in a couple of places, including the last paragraph.  This is a beautifully laid-out and extremely well-written article--in fact, I'd say it's the best magazine piece I've ever read on Ohio hauntings.  Click below to take a look at it.

In October of 2003 my name was in the <i>OSU Alumni Magazine</i> again, except this time the piece was written <i>by</i> me rather than <i>about</i> me.  It's an article called "Through the Keyhole:  Unlocking Ohio State's Hidden Spaces," and it deals with places on campus which are generally off-limits to the general public.  It also turned out to be the story editor Lynne Bonenberger went with for the cover.  To read the article, click below.

By far the biggest piece of press coverage ever to involve my website was the article which ran in <i>The Washington Post</i> on December 30, 2001.  The story, written by Carolyn Crowley, is titled "Urban Explorers, Crawling and Climbing Into the Past."  It took up the entire last page of the Style section of the <i>Post</i>--and yes, we are talking about THE WASHINGTON POST, the one that brought down Richard Nixon and has that John Philip Sousa march named for it.  I thought it was altogether a very fair and well-written article, and I'm not just saying that because I'm in it.  Click below to read it in its entirety as it appeared in the Washington Post.

On Halloween night 2001 I was asked by the Ohio News Network to appear on their program <i>Primetime Ohio</i> to talk about ghost stories in Ohio.  I mentioned the Gore Orphanage and some other Ohio legends and was on TV several times that night when they reran the broadcast.  The people at ONN, including producer Amy Backus and anchor John Fortney, made it quite a pleasant experience, and I ended up with a lot of hits and e-mails from the appearance.

The first piece of press coverage I ever received was an article by John Ruch in the Halloween edition of Columbus's <a href = "http://www.theotherpaper.com">The Other Paper</a>.  This was followed by an article about my buddy Rookie over at <a href = "http://www.geocities.com/illicitohio">Illicit Ohio</a> which mentioned my site as well.  Click below to read either article.

And finally, I got a very nice unsolicited award.  Not bad, right?
