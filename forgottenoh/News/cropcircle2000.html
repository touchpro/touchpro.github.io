Bainbridge - ET phone home?
<p>
Lovers of mysteries and UFO enthusiasts take heed:  Paranormal
activity is alive and well just east of Bainbridge on U.S. 50.
<p>
On the farm of Roscoe and Elizabeth Swartz three genuine crop
circles have appeared. They were discovered in a wheat field
Thursday by farmer Bob Mark - who was baling hay at the time.
<p>
Some possible - albeit maybe not plausible - reasons for their
appearance include, but are not limited to:  aliens, Druids,
Native American mysticism, the recent summer solstice, or maybe
they are simply the work of a resourceful and inventive
prankster.
<p>
Whatever the case may be, the Swartz's have but a short time to
enjoy their circles; that field is scheduled to be cut today.
<p>
"There's no sign of machinery, but they're so geometrically
perfect," said Roscoe, an oral surgeon. "Maybe it has to do with
summer solstice." Evidence to the contrary is scarce, "I don't
know how anyone could've gotten in or out... nothing's knocked
down and there are no tracks - it's a phenomenon we just can't
explain," he added.
<p>
One of the circles is nearly 40 feet in diameter - but it is the
other two that appear most interesting.  They contain an inner
circle of almost 30 feet in diameter, an outer "ring" of three
feet in width that encompasses the center circle.  Two
"concentric circles," if you will.
<p>
The trio of circles are just a few feet apart and are in an area
not far from Seip Mound - where ancient earthworks once stood -
before losing their battle with the plow. "There's a lot of
Indian lore about this area..." continued Roscoe.
<p>
The Swartz family has lived on the farm for 31 years and have
never seen anything like it.  "I think maybe we were invaded by
the Druids," Roscoe further hypothesized.
<p>
According to Elizabeth and Roscoe, the circles are a welcome
break:  "Usually the biggest thing they find around here are
marijuana plants - and no one knows where they come from
either!"
<p>
Roscoe said that when he first saw the circles he though "What
is this?" then spent some time making crude measurements and
taking a few pictures before calling The Gazette.  "Every now and
then there's some goofy article like this in there - I thought
it'd be fun."
<p>
Dale Mark was there continuing work on the hay bailing process.
"My wife said I'd been dreaming about UFO's," he said - before
deciding it might be better not to go on.
<p>
Elizabeth, who is an artist, was much more careful with her
words.  Unlike her husband she seemed dubious of committing
herself to the question of their origins.  "Whether it's a hoax
or not it's still well done," she said, commenting somewhat
reluctantly "I better not mention UFOs."
<p>
With the hay scheduled to be baled today, and no explanation of
their origins likely to come, for now Elizabeth and Roscoe can
only ponder the question "Where did they come from?" while the
Bainbridge crop circles are soon to be another one of "History's
Mysteries."
