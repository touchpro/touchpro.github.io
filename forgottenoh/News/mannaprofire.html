CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio -- A spectacular fire that burned for hours Saturday and Sunday destroyed the vacant Manna Pro Feed Co. mill near downtown and led to the evacuation of about 30 homes on Sunday.
<p>
No injuries were reported from the E. Mill Street blaze, about five blocks east of Rt. 23 and just south of downtown. The rekindled fire was discovered shortly after 6 a.m. on Sunday. On Saturday night, firefighters had extinguished a small fire at the mill, which was undergoing demolition.
<p>
A firefighter from Franklin County's Hamilton Township department was treated for a possible heart attack, authorities said. Several departments responded.
<p>
About 30 homes were evacuated for several hours because of health concerns over heavy smoke, officials said. Flames and a pyre of smoke could be seen for miles.
The fire also damaged a nearby house and a pole barn containing farm chemicals at the adjacent Circleville Ag Products Co., officials said.
<p>
The mill, which produced animal feed, was closed in 2002. The cause of the fire remained under investigation.
