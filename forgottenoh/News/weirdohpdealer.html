A leisurely Sunday drive through the back roads in the family station wagon has gone the way of, well, back roads and station wagons.
<p>
Life in America is all schedules, SUVs and freeways now. Lost between the exit signs are the odd ducks, quirky sites and folklore that make life unpredictable and fun.
<p>
You won't find the pickled fingers of Mary Bach, the wall of chewing gum or the Melonheads along any highway.
<p>
But a new book, "Weird Ohio: Your Travel Guide to Ohio's Local Legends and
Best Kept Secrets" (Sterling, $19.95), takes you there.  It's that family
road trip -- without the annoying potty breaks and "Are we there yets?"
<p>
"Weird Ohio" is a collaboration of the bizarre, unexplained, creepy and just
plain amusing, covering all four corners of the state. Ohio apparently has a wealth of weirdness.
<p>
"This place is ripe with it," said Jim Willis, one of three contributing "Weird Ohio" authors.
<p>
Willis, a Columbus ad copywriter and founder of a paranormal research group called Ghosts of Ohio, said he's partial to the scary stories but is especially hooked by sites with rich history.
<p>
Such as the tragic tale of Mary Bach, which goes something like this:  She
didn't complete her daily chores to the liking of her farmer husband Carl.  So, in 1883, he carved her up with a corn knife, dismembered her body and hid the pieces-parts.
<p>
Once Carl turned himself in, the sheriff took three of Mary's fingers and stored them in a glass of formaldehyde as evidence.
<p>
Today, the pickled digits sit in a display case -- by the knife, the noose
used to hang Carl and a ticket to his public execution at the county fair -- in the Wood County Historical Museum in Bowling Green.
<p>
Another is the legend of the Melonheads, a fabled freakout that just won't die. The story survives in various forms but basically involves kids with oversize heads living in a cabin deep in the woods off Wisner Road in Kirtland. 
<p>
Depending on whose version you favor, they're either the result of:  secret
government testing, a doctor's brain experiments or a disease that swelled their heads. 
<p>
"No matter where they came from," the book says, "most kids in the area know
somebody whose sister's best friend knew a guy whose dentist saw the Melonheads." 
<p>
Today, local high school kids still drive around late at night to snatch a peek. 
<p>
Some of the finds are neither gruesome nor ghoulish, but just plain 
odd.
Such as the famous wall of gum in the southwest Ohio town of 
Greenville.
<p>
Pull up to the Maid-Rite Drive-In for its popular "loose-meat" 
sandwiches,
and you'll notice an unusual tradition that's continued for more than 
60
years. Two sides of the building are splattered with wads of chewed 
gum,
stuck there as customers entered.
<p>
"There's no handed-down story about when and how it got started," Steve
Canter, the restaurant/carryout's managing partner said by phone, but 
the gum wall has grown so popular that the owners sell gum-wall T-shirts.
<p>
"Weird Ohio" is the latest in a series of Weird books by a Barnes & 
Noble Inc. publishing division. The concept began about 15 years ago as an 
amateur newsletter by two guys in New Jersey (Mark Sceurman and Mark Moran) with an eye and a fascination for the unusual. The two Marks found others around the country who share that same "weird eye" to publish other Weird books.
<p>
Willis and co-author Andy Henderson, a Columbus writer and researcher who runs the Web site Forgotten Ohio, contributed peculiar stories and locations they already knew.  But they also traveled the state in search of new ones.  A third contributor, Loren Coleman, who is not from Ohio, lent his expertise for a section on such bizarre creatures as the Lake Erie serpent and 
the Mothman of Gallipolis.
<p>
"Weird Ohio" is one of eight Weird state books published in 2005, with at least as many planned for this year.
<p>
"Weird Ohio" comes clean that many of its mysteries are pure urban 
legend.  The book also offers a warning:  Many of the sites featured are on 
private property and shouldn't be visited.
<p>
But most of the places are fair game, so load the kids into the SUV, 
silence the pager and hit the back roads.
<p>
By the way, are we there yet?
