<br> 
So I'm not the only one who likes a
                      good freeway mystery. 
<p>
                      My invitation to send questions
                      about puzzling sights along freeways
                      drew a strong response. 
<p>
                      Curious commuters asked about
                      lonely cemeteries, lighted monoliths
                      and crooked reflectors. They
                      wanted to know about the mountain
                      rising along I-71 and the peninsula
                      appearing suddenly near Rt. 315. 
<p>
                      I received more questions than I
                      could answer, at least in round one: 
<p>
                      Q: I would like to know about a
                      mound. It's on I-71 south, not too
                      far past the sewer plant. 
<p>
                      -- Christina Traven, Columbus 
<p>
                      A: The Franklin County Landfill
                      inspired several inquiries -- and no
                      wonder: The man-made mountain of
                      trash is one of the highest points
                      around. 
<p>
                      About 90 percent of the county's
                      trash goes to the landfill, on Rt. 665
                      just west of I-71. 
<p>
                      At 120 acres, it ranks as the fifth-largest public landfill in the country,
                      according to Waste News, an industry publication. 
<p>
                      The top of the landfill is 1,010 feet above sea level. The highest point in
                      Franklin County, in the northeast corner near New Albany, is 1,132
                      feet. 
<p>
                      The impressive mountain of trash will get bigger but not much higher,
                      said Michael Long, director of the Solid Waste Authority of Central
                      Ohio. It will top out at 1,020 feet and eventually cover 363 acres. 
<p>
                      How soon is an open question. 
<p>
                      "If everybody recycles, we can slow it down,'' Long said. 
<p>
                      Q: What is that small cemetery next to I-70 on a small hill between
                      Eureka Avenue and Harper Road? 
<p>
                      -- Steve Vlasic, Columbus 
<p>
                      A: What a forlorn spot. 
<p>
                      Motorists traveling east on I-70 toward Downtown get a glimpse of an
                      old cemetery next to a railroad track on the West Side -- just west of
                      the W. Broad Street exit. 
<p>
                      Some readers asked whether it's a Civil War burial ground. It's not. 
<p>
                      The graves are contained in the Asylum Cemetery, where some
                      residents of the Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital -- once called the
                      Central Ohio Lunatic Asylum -- were buried. The last wing of the
                      hospital, an enormous edifice where the mentally ill were
                      institutionalized, was demolished in 1991. 
<p>
                      The cemetery, which consists of three adjacent burial grounds, includes
                      the final resting places of some inmates -- such as executed murderers
                      -- from the Ohio Penitentiary, said Lois Neff of the Hilltop Historical
                      Society. 
<p>
                      Leona Gustafson, who maintains a Web site (homepages.rootsweb. 

                      com/~rocky/Franklin_Cemeteries) on Franklin County cemeteries, has
                      counted more than 300 graves in the portion of the cemetery visible
                      from I-70. 
<p>
                      Many of the headstones contain names and dates of birth and death. A
                      few are marked "Unknown.'' 
<p>
                      The cemetery is maintained, but the graves are devoid of decoration.
                      The rush of traffic on I-70 simply reinforces the feeling of a place for
                      people who never found their way in the flow of society. 
<p>
                      Q: Two steel posts with solar- panel devices affixed to the top of each
                      are situated on I-70 in Madison County. For what purpose is the
                      electricity generated? 
<p>
                      -- James Larson, West Jefferson 
<p>
                      A: The two posts between mile markers 80 and 81 on I-70 are solar-
                      powered traffic counters. 
<p>
                      A cable in the pavement measures the size and speed of vehicles, and
                      sends the information to boxes next to the posts. The data is then
                      transmitted by telephone lines to an Ohio Department of Transportation
                      office, said Tony Manch, a traffic engineer. 
<p>
                      Knowledge about the number and types of vehicles using I-70 helps in
                      planning highway projects. It also gives conspiracy theorists something
                      to mutter about. 
<p>
                      Just west of the traffic sensors, at the Rt. 29 exit, is another slender
                      device: a weather station, topped by a wind gauge. 

                      The station relays the pavement temperature, wind speed and other
                      information to a maintenance site. The data helps the department know
                      when to salt the interchange to prevent ice from forming, said Ned
                      Kerstetter, interstate maintenance coordinator. 

                      An even higher-tech device is installed on the ice-prone ramp from
                      westbound I-270 to Rt. 315. It uses radio waves to collect traffic and
                      weather data. 
<p>
                      Unlike the Rt. 29 weather station, Manch said, most of the equipment is
                      buried in the pavement. 
<p>
                      Q: Reflectors in the right lane of a stretch of I-270 (just west of I-71
                      near Grove City) must have been installed by a significantly impaired
                      man or machine. The reflectors are installed in a manner that looks like
                      a failed sobriety test. 
<p>
                      -- Tish Hevel, Dublin 
<p>
                      A: Despite their appearance, the off-kilter lane reflectors were installed
                      by sober people, I'm told. 
<p>
                      They are crooked on purpose. 
<p>
                      The state is testing to see which reflector best withstands the impact of
                      a snowplow blade, Kerstetter said. Installing them in wavy lines ensures
                      that a snowplow blade hits them. 
<p>
                      If the reflectors were aligned with the white lane markings, plow drivers
                      would avoid them. 
<p>
                      Q: Please find out about the man-made peninsula on the west side of
                      Rt. 315 just north of the Wilson Bridge Road overpass. 
<p>
                      -- John P. Wanous, Columbus 
<p>
                      A: Several readers inquired about the "peninsula,'' which seemingly
                      appeared out of nowhere at the northeast corner of Wilson Bridge and
                      Olentangy River roads. 
<p>
                      The dirt was excavated from the southwest corner, where Camelot
                      Homes is building Maple Hill Retreat, a subdivision of houses costing
                      $400,000 or more each. It was moved to the northeast corner at the
                      request of the landowner, who wanted to fill in the ravine there, partly
                      to deflect freeway noise, said Pat Bigler of Camelot. 
<p>
                      The earth was graded and planted with grass, Bigler said, for erosion
                      control. 
<p>
                      The small red flags at the edge mark the erosion-control fence. 
<p>
                      The landowner could not be reached for comment, but, said Bigler, the
                      owner has no immediate plans to build anything there. 

                      And no building permit has been requested for the site, a Worthington
                      official said. 
<p>
                      Q: On eastbound I-70 approaching Downtown (across the freeway
                      from Miranova), three stone monoliths are illuminated at night. What are
                      they? What do they mean? Who did them and when? 
<p>
                      -- Tom Linzell, Columbus 
<p>
                      A: The monoliths, titled "Needles of Stone,'' were designed by
                      landscape-architecture students at Ohio State University to decorate
                      the Furnace Street electrical substation, a city facility built in 1989. 
<p>
                      With the substation a prominent sight on the freeway, the city wanted to
                      enhance it with artwork. 
<p>
                      The monoliths, states a brochure from the substation dedication, are
                      designed "to invite curiosity about the nature of the substation and about
                      energy.'' 
<p>
                      They recall the ancient belief, demonstrated at places such as
                      Stonehenge, that energy could be tapped through the careful placement
                      of objects. 
<p>
                      With fuel-consuming cars racing past a fuel-consuming substation, that
                      stretch of freeway is, indeed, an energetic place.
