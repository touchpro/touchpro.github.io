According to Chris Woodyard's <i>Haunted Ohio</i>, every night at midnight in Falls Township, Hocking County, you can hear the screams of a man who was killed in a drilling accident.
<p>
In early March of 2001 my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to investigate this one.  Despite reports to the contrary from a friend of mine who is from Falls Township (which contains the city of Logan), we thought there might be a chance.
<p>
So we rented a cabin overnight at <a href = "http://www.hockinghills.com/irisvilla">The Iris Villa</a>, cooked some steaks, and waited outside in the hot tub.  Midnight came and went; no screams.  Maybe it only happens occasionally.  At any rate, I'd like to recommend this method of ghost investigation to everyone.
