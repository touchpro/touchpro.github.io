The story of a ghostly visitation in a dorm at Granville's <a href = "../Counties/Licking/denison.html">Denison University</a>, sent to me by Jason.  Granville is also home to the very haunted <a href = "../Counties/Licking/buxton.html">Buxton Inn</a>, as well as some extremely old and eerie cemeteries.

Hey, this is a really cool website you got here. I just thought I'd share something with you that happened to me a few years back while attending Denison University in Granville, Ohio.  So here it is.
<p> 
Around 8 or 9 one warm night back in 1999, I was sitting in front of the computer in my dorm room typing up a paper for my Ancient Epics class.  The only door to my room was behind me and it was closed and locked.  My roommate had gone off to the rec center, so I was the only one in the room.  
<p>
About half way through my report, I felt a little tap on my right shoulder. There had been a water leak in my room, so I just though it was a drop of water from the ceiling.  But just a couple seconds later, the room got really cold and I felt someone's hand on the same shoulder...like they were leaning over me to see what I was writing.  I thought it was kind of odd cause I didn't hear the door open.  I turned to see who it was, and nothing was there.  
<p>
I just froze in my seat and kept thinking, "Should I run or should I stay still?"  Finally I chose to get the hell outta there!  I jumped up out of my chair and hi-tailed it out of the door and down the hallway.  My heart was beating 200 miles an hour and I was shaking like a leaf in a hurricane.  After a few minutes I calmed down, but every time I tried to go back in the room, I'd get a really strange feeling and start shaking again.  Needless to say I didn't get my paper in on time.  I spent the majority of the night down in the lobby trying to gain enough courage to try to go back in my room.  
<p>
When my roommate got back a couple hours later, he went in and to his surprise (despite the warm temperature outside), the room was colder than ice.  He asked me how it got so cold in there without having any windows open or fans blowing and I just kinda played it off.  After we both went back in the room, the coldness faded away.  
<p>
I never did tell him about the hand I felt on my shoulder nor the sudden change of temperature when I felt it.  Chamberlin Lodge (where I lived) used to be a frat house--I think one of the oldest on campus...and in the Denison Cemetery there was a tombstone with the name Chamberlin on it.  Maybe it was a frat brother who paid a visit to see what was going on in his old room; I'm not sure.  I just know one thing--I never want to experience anything like that again!

A very convincing story from one of Ohio's most historic colleges.
