When I was about fifteen years old my family and I moved into an old house on East Rich Street in Columbus, Ohio.  The house belonged to a family friend's father.  Little did I know that the father had had a heart attack and died in the attic.  Our friend had nailed the attic door shut with gutter spikes so none of us kids could get the door open--because the attic wasn't finished, he said.
<p>
About two weeks after we moved in I began hearing noises in the attic like someone was walking around up there.  I mentioned it to my mom and she told me that it was probably a squirrel or something so I didnt pay any attention to it after that.  
<p>
Then, about a week later, I was laying down and I heard somebody walking on the steps.  At first I thought it was someone either walking up the steps or walking down so I yelled that they didnt have to stomp.  Then I went out to the hallway and realized that the sounds were coming from behind the attic door.  I ran back into my room (which happened to be right across the hall from the attic door) and locked the door.  I could hear the attic door open and someone walk down the hall, then stop.  I was so scared that I didn't leave my room until morning.  
<p>
The next night I heard the same noises but this time, instead of walking down the hall, they stopped right in front of my bedroom door, the doorknob rattled, and then the door burst open.  Nobody was there.  I naturally thought that it was my brothers messing with me so I yelled down the hall that I was going to tell mom then I slammed the door shut and locked it.  Not even five minutes later the doorknob rattled, the lock popped, and the door burst open and again there was no one there.  I yelled to mom to get my brothers then I slammed the door and locked it once again.  And again the doorknob rattled, the lock popped, and the door burst open.  Now I was getting scared.  I ran down the hall, looked in my brothers' room, and saw they were not in there.  So I went downstairs and told my mom that the boys were trying to scare me.  I was mistaken, she said, because the boys were not even home!  
<p>
She said I had probably fallen asleep and dreamt it, so I went back to my room, knowing that I was not dreaming it.  I asked whoever or whatever it was to please stop scaring me.  It stopped for a couple of days and I began to think that maybe I <i>had</i> dreamt it. 
<p>
Then one night I was taking a bath and I heard someone messing with the bathroom doorknob so I yelled that I was in the tub and whoever it was would have to wait.  I finished my bath and went to my room and dressed for bed, then laid down after finishing my homework and watched TV until I drifted off.  
<p>
Later on I was awakened to some noise in my closet.  I looked over at the closet and, to my surprise, there was an old man standing there.  When he saw me looking at him he walked over to my bed and bent down and was so close that I was frozen with fear.  I could see through him but it looked like I was trying to see through fog.  He started saying something that I couldn't make out, and then he says, "Did you not hear me, I said this is my house so get out."  Then he just started repeating, "Get out! Get out! Get out!"  
<p>
Needless to say, I moved in with my grandparents the next day and refused to set foot back in that house.  I have heard since then that the old man looks out the attic window, and that you can hear him talking.  A friend of mine who used to babysit for the next family to live there after us says that if you walk to the back room, you can hear a baby crying.
<p>
The house now sits empty because the guy who bought it can't get anybody to move in or if they do move in they won't stay for longer than a month.

The people who experienced this were definitely convinced, and I find it hard to believe that so many people could share an experience without there being something to it.  Also, the gas leak could be viewed one of two ways:  either that's what people didn't like about the apartment, or it's part of the manifestations of whatever was haunting it.  It's hard to say, but the very nice girl who sent me the story was very much convinced.

The second story takes place in Woodland Meadows, an apartment complex thats is on the East side of Columbus near Port Columbus Airport, it was used as barracks years ago. My sister lived upstairs on the thrid floor with her daughter and I lived on the second floor with my son and daughter. One night me and my sister were sitting in my apartment talking, my sister was sitting at the table facing the hallway and I was sitting on the couch, my sister was in midsentence when she just stopped and was staring down the hallway, I asked her what was the matter, she shook her head and told me that she was just seeing things, she began talking again then she just jumped up and started for the hallway, she grabbed my hand and drug me with her. I was shocked and asked her why she was acting like that and if she was trying to scare me that it worked, she says" Shelly, I swear that i just saw a man walk from the bathroom into the bedroom", I about lost my mind because I thought somone had broke into the apartment, when I went into the bedroom and there was no one in there but our daughters and my son, I looked everywhere until I was satisfied that there was no one else in the apartment, we stayed up all night after that scare. Things began coming up missing from both our apartments and we would find them in diiferent places, we would hear voices and hear people in hallway but no one was out there. Then about a week after those things began happening my daughter woke up ran out of room and told me that a man was shaking her bed, I walked her back to the room and told her she was having a bad dream, I asked her what he look like but she that if she told me he would get mad and come back so I left it alone until morning, when I was walking them to school I asked her again to tell me what he looked like, she told me that he had a green face, red eyes and really sharp teeth and a scary smile. I told her that when she got home we go in the room and say some prayers and see if that helped, we did that and there was no incident that night or so I had thought, when I woke her up the next morning she had what looked like tally marks all over her arms, I jumped on her for writing on herself and swore up and down that she didnt do it, I told her that I would take all the markers out of her room if it happened again, the next morning there were the tally marks again except now they were not only on her arms but also on her chest and her back, I thought that maybe my son was doing it so I told to stop writing on his sister and again he swore that he was not doing it. The next morning she was completely covered, I mean they were on her from head to toe, even on her scalp, I called my sister and asked her come down and take a look and asked her what I should do, she said that I should take anything out of the room that could be used to write or draw with, I had already done that, so we were both at a loss as to what to do, I told her about the green "man" my daughter had seen and she said that maybe it was a ghost, that night I was laying on the couch when both the kids came running out the room saying that both their beds were shaking and that the "man" had got mad because I told my sister about "him" so I told them that they could just stay in frontroom with me for the night and imagine my fright when I looked at the closet and saw a green "man" sitting or more liked perched on my hamper looking at me, he never moved but just sat there staring at me, I did not go to sleep at all because I was afraid that if I went to sleep he would try to do something to my children or to me. The next morning I sent my daughter into the room to get dressed for school thinking that it would be safe for her in the daytime being that nothing happened during the day, well 15 minutes passed and she had not come out so i sent her brother back to tell her to come on that we were going to be late, he came back out and told me that sissy wanted me and that she would not open the door, I ran down the hall and tried to open the door and for a full minute I could not get the door to open when I did get it open my daughter was laying face down on the bed crying, I asked her what was wrong and she looked up at me and she had a huge knot on her forhead and she said that he started throwing things at her because she had slept in the room and that we were telling people about him. We had no other place to move to so we lived in fear for six more months until we were able to move, my sister also had a ghost in her apartment, it was a little girl and she would run around the apartment calling my sister mommy. One night we were upstairs talking while my niece was in the tub, we never shut the bathroom door while she was bathing because she only four at the time. My niece called out to my sister and asked her why that little girl was calling her mommy and if she was her new sister. My sister just looked at me. At first the little girl was only at the apartment but then she began following my sister where ever she went and was always calling her mommy, one day my sister had come home from spending the night at her fiances' house and the little girl asked her why she had left her there all by herself, my sister was so scared that she started dtaying at fiances' house more and more. We would walk to the store and we could feel things watching us so we began having people walk with us and we would not leave our apartments at night unless we absolutely had to. I am glad to say to that neither us has set foot back in Woodland Meadows since we moved away and we probably never will.
