A few ghostly encounters from the area around Kent, Ohio, sent to me by Aimee.

First off, let me aknowledge the fact that I love your site! I have 
loved ghosts ever since I was nine years old!  
<p>
My story goes as follows:  My 
friends and I and my father decided that we would go to a bunch of haunted 
places with our brand new camera that has night-vision.  The first two places 
we went to , were Black Horse and Towner's Woods.... Both of which are 
located in 
Kent, Ohio. To our disappointment, we found nothing, except satanic 
graffiti 
and an old bridge at Black Horse.  When we got to the 
bridge, we shined our camera (which had the night-vision still on) on 
what 
we heard to be a river underneath of us.  Oddly enough, we couldn't 
even see 
the water with the night vision.  As we decided to go underneath the old 
train 
tracks of the bridge, we heard a train coming and got off the tracks.  
The 
weird thing is, that the train came right by us, we could feel the wind 
and 
everything, and you could tell it was right there by the sound, but no 
train 
was to be seen.  We tried to get it on video and all you can see is the 
sparks and light from the train and you can tell it is right by us.  
<p>
After that incident, we walked back to our car and decided to go to the last 
place 
we had heard of, called On Top of the World, which is an old state 
park on 
top of a hill--in Summit or Wayne County, I believe. (My dad was the 
one 
driving, and I'm not too great on giving directions, but if you look it 
up, 
it should be in that area and it is still a running state park.)  When 
we got 
to the top of the curving road, we saw the dirt road that we were 
looking 
for.  Unfortunately, it sneaks up on you, so we had to make a U-turn in 
the 
road.  We started up the old dirt driveway and already I had a bad 
feeling 
about the place.
<p>
At the top of the hill was an old barn, and as the 
road 
circled around, we finally came to an old abandoned house that was 
boarded 
up.  The house was a faded white color and it had a lonely stretch for 
a 
yard.  The story we were told was:  Back in the 1950s-1960s, a man 
lived on 
the farm with two children and his wife.  Now, there are two sides to 
the 
story.  One is that the man had a pact with a satanic cult that he did 
not 
follow through with, and the satanic cult killed his family and hung 
him.  The 
other story, which we found to be more truthful, was that the man 
killed his 
wife and his children, hacking them up and storing their bodies in 
different 
parts of the house, and then continued by hanging himself in the basement, 
after 
writing satanic symbols on the walls of his home with his family's 
blood.  
<p>
Slowly, I got out of the car.  My best friend was clinging to me, 
because she 
had a bad feeling as well.  We walked around the house and found that 
part 
of the porch was torn down and not finished.  We walked around the back 
of the 
house and my dad turned off the camera.  We found a hole inside of the 
house 
in the basement.  My friend who is 6"3' tried to get in so he could film 
the 
inside of the house, but he couldn't fit.  When he was getting out of 
the 
hole, everyone but my father, who is almost 
completely 
deaf, heard a woman cry out.  It wasn't a scream, but more like a 
whimper.  
Instinctively, we noticed that it came from the back of the house, and 
we 
doubted that it was anyone else, considering that it was almost one in 
the 
morning...and the moon was bright that night, so we didn't see anyone 
either.  After squeezing together tightly, my dad decided that he would go inside the house, 
considering 
that he was only 5"4".  
<p>
When he came out, we saw a car 
pulling in 
and thought that we were all in big trouble with the cops.  Lucky for 
us, it 
was a family that was doing the same thing that we were.  They had been 
at 
the house earlier and actually got a ghost on tape, which I saw
when he 
showed it to me through the camera itself.  The film showed a black 
form in 
front of the shed that began to walk around the house, and then the 
film 
became fuzzy, as most films will do after the environmental change 
when a 
ghost is around.  He told us that he had visited the house a lot and 
the scariest thing he saw was the ghost at the shed (which, if you stand at 
the 
furthest tree, you're supposed to see) and a woman's cry that comes 
from the 
back of the house. Immmediately, my friend and I looked at 
each other and 
told him that we had just heard that scream at the back of the house. 
<p>
After 
that, we went home and rewound the tape to see if we caught anything....
Well, 
we did.  When my dad was inside the house, he passes in front of an old 
fireplace; standing right there in front of him, is a black figure!  At 
first 
we thought maybe it was a burned place in the fireplace, so we put the tape on 
slow 
motion and found that the ghost was away from the fireplace, and it 
moved! 
Also, we saw alot of areas in the house where it looked like the police 
had 
to dig into...which leads us to believe the second version of the story, about the 
man 
hacking up his family and storing them in different parts of the house.
<p>  
Down 
in the basement, it looked like blood-stains were on the wall and a 
giant 
hole was ripped into it.  In another upstairs room (which my dad said 
had low ceilings, so we guessed it was probally the children's room), 
there was a 
large hole in one of the walls as well.  Neither of the holes looked like 
they 
should have been there, nor did they look like they were put there by 
an 
angry fist; the holes looked like little tombs, where the man probably 
stored 
some of the body parts.  Also, my friend had a pair of night vision 
glasses.  He gave the glasses to me and told me to look at the field.  When I 
did, I 
saw a large black orb sitting in the field next to the trees. 
<p>
After 
our 
visit, my friend decided to research the place. She found out the 
family's name was the Adams family, strangely enough.  And the farm was owned 
by the 
father.
<p>
I have had alot of experiences, but this one was the worst 
and 
most ghostly experience I have ever had.  Needless to say, I haven't 
been 
back there.... If I wanted to see it again, I can just watch our video 
tape, 
where the murderer's face can be clearly seen.

It's an interesting story, but it contains a lot of conjecture, if you ask me.  The holes in the wall aren't <i>necessarily</i> where a murderer stored body parts...but it's a scary thought all the same.  Thanks to Aimee.
