An investigation of Columbus's Greenlawn Cemetery, sent to me by Ron.

I've been to Greenlawn several times, but only one by
myself, and I'd like to say I'll never go back by
myself, either.  But I know I will, because I'm a
sucker in the long end of things.
<p>
But the two occasions that I did go with someone, the
mausoleum had a funny event.
<p>
First time: took the camera, wanted to take good
pictures of the stained glass window, the mosaics,
etc.  My wife was feeling very uncomfortable about
staying in the mausoleum, so she went outside for a
moment to get some air.
<p>
I set up the camera on the tripod, and as my wife was
coming back in I was walking over to use the men's
room.
<p>
In the small corridor, I was immediately hit by a very
distinct smell--cigarette smoke.  Very sharp, very
pungent, as rich as if someone had literally just blew
a puff of it into my face, except I couldn't see it. 
There was neither ashtray nor cigarette receptacle
present (nor are there any in the entire mausoleum
that I could see/find).  I proceeded to the small (and
dismal) men's room. No butts in the toilet.  I took
care of my business hurriedly and walked out, still
smelling the strong waft of smoke in that same cramped
space.
<p>
Nobody but my wife and I in the building, and from the
sound/look of things as we'd approached the building,
nobody at all had been in there for a little while
(there was dust on several seats, and the carpet
tracks looked stepped-down, suggesting that it was at
least a day or two since a cleaning crew came
through).  The registry podium at the front door still
has sign-in sheets for 1998.
<p>
So I told my wife about it, and that was really it. 
An odd occurrence, but nothing too odd, really.
<p>
Second trip was a couple of weeks later, with my
friend Lucy, who is a horror writer like myself. 
Again, I took the camera and gear for pictures.
<p>
As I was setting up, this time Lucy went to the
women's room.  She came back a minute later and
remarked "Man, somebody sure has a cigarette habit,
don't they?"  I froze, looking at her, and ran past
her to the entrance to the women's room.  Sure
enough--heavy, smoky cigarette smell, as fresh as from
a Vegas poker table.
<p>
Our ultimate and sane conclusion is that it must be
some member of the cleaning crew who is taking their
smoke break in the bathroom--partly to hide it since I
imagine smoking isn't permitted, but also partly
because the toilet would be the only place in the
building to discard the evidence.  But the first time
in the men's room, the second time in the ladies'? 
And both times with absolutely no evidence of the
smoker anywhere around or in the building the last
twenty or so minutes we were there each time?  With
the smoke smell so fresh you practically saw it in
front of you?  Unusual.  Not improbable, but unusual.
<p>
The other thing at Greenlawn is the Hayden Mausoleum. 
You can't miss it--it's the next largest single
structure in the entire cemetery, and literally about
seventy yards to the left of the main mausoleum.  Of
course, being a family tomb, this one is long-ago
locked and rusted shut against visitors to its
interior.  However, I have no desire to want to see
inside THIS particular visiting site.
<p>
Walking up the half-dozen or so steps to the terrace,
you can see that the left of the double doors
(huge--must be ten feet high doors if they're an inch)
has a segment of about five inches high and three
across cut out of the door--wooden doors, I might add.
 Kind of unusual for a tomb.
<p>
On my trip with Lucy, it was a bright, sunny
afternoon--so bright and sunny I was running with
sweat even with a T-shirt on.  We walked up--there's
classically creepy black graveyard moss in the cracks
of the stone--to the front doors.
<p>
We saw the hole.
<p>
I dared myself to go up and peer in.  I had to hunker
down on my legs.  Popping my knees, resting a hand for
balance, I leaned forward hesitantly.
<p>
A wash of dank, ice-cold air just blew into my face,
like someone was on the other side of the same hole,
waiting to fwoosh it into my eyes.  I rubbed my eyes
and continued to peer in.
<p>
Couldn't see a thing except, at a severely high angle,
to the back, probably fifteen to twenty feet off the
ground, I saw two windows of stained
yellow-and-emerald glass.  That was it.  They didn't
illuminate a damned thing, though this was around one
o' clock and those windows had an eastern exposure.
<p>
Lucy took a peek, and then we had the brainstorm to
put the digital camera, flash on, against the hole and
take haphazard shots, to see what it could see.
<p>
Took a few shots, and inside it revealed a round,
plain stone chamber.  In the center of the circular
floor was a font or some sort of large open-topped
urn, possibly for flower arrangements.  And all around
the perimeter of the floor, at regular intervals, were
squared-off blocks with vaulted lids--like sarcophagi
only short, squat, too small to be anyone lying down
in state.  Possibly crematory markers.
<p>
Stone shards and dust littered the floor of the
picture, and we figured it must be long gone into a
state of disrepair--probably hasn't been a single soul
inside those doors since they were locked shut and
allowed to rust to a bright flake-gold hue.
<p>
Still...sealed up with just a couple of gas vents in
its foundation (to prevent the build-up of
decomposition gases in lead-lined cases which can
cause explosions, at least as the science goes during
the late 19th century when the tomb dates back to), it
felt ghoulish to have that puff of air just happen
into my face as I was leaning into the door.
<p>
I would never, ever recommend going into Greenlawn
alone, unless you're feeling particularly daring about
your lack of fear.  Greenlawn might not be haunted at
all--but somehow I doubt it.  If volume and density
count for anything paranormally speaking, then
Greenlawn would have to be haunted out of sheer
condensation--spiritual density packed so tight in
every foot of the place that it practically FORCES a
sensation of not being alone on you.
<p>
Those're my two cents, anyway.  I'll be putting up my
own Geocities site shortly featuring my pictures and
comments at http://www.geocities.com/Midnight.html. 
Have a good one.

I definitely need to get up to Greenlawn when the weather improves.
