The story of a haunting experienced in an old townhome in a suburb of Cincinnati.

I used to rent a townhome in Mariemont, Ohio (suburb of Cincinnati). After doing some research I found out that these particular townhomes were built in the late 1920's. Anyways, from the day we moved in the strange things started happening. 
<p>
Our first day there I was upstairs unpacking things in the bathroom, my husband went to go get some food. About 10 mins later I heard the back door open, close and then footsteps coming through the hall. I yelled down to my husband but got no reply. So, I went downstairs - nobody was there and both the front and back doors were open. This really freaked me out - but things just got worse. 
<p>
On my first night sleeping there alone (my husband used to work night shift) - the master bedroom upstairs had an old deadbolt on the door only accessible from the inside of the room. I went to bed with the door deadbolted. In the middle of the night I heard a loud POP - I sat up and looked around but saw nothing. I went back to sleep. A few hours later I heard someone rattling the door handle trying to get in - I thought it was my husband who had returned from work. Being that I was so tired, I yelled "I'm not opening the door" and went back to sleep. When I awoke - I found the door wide open. I went downstairs and ask my husband how he got the door open - and he replied "it was open when I came home." 
<p>
One bedroom was ALWAYS cold, and whenever I went in there I felt like someone was watching me. Whenever I slept upstairs I had TERRIBLE nightmares of people being beat up and killed. My VCR would always stop in the middle of movies (runs perfectly since we moved), lamps would go on and off (and rock back and forth), doors would open and close. 
<p>
One night my husband fell asleep on the couch, and I in my chair. I woke up in the middle of the night terrified - flipped on the light and our silverware from dinner which we had left on the coffee table had been bent up. 
Another night I was laying on the couch - looked up and saw an old man in suspenders and a red hat on the stairs watching me. Then he just faded away. 
The basement was very spooky - late at night when I went down there it felt like someone was breathing on my neck. We had an old couch downstairs that we decided to sell and took pictures of it. I attached the pictures for you to evaluate. They were taken middle of the afternoon, it was not a damp basement. However, it was very scary - hooks in the walls & ceilings (large meat hooks!) 
Well, I could go on and on with more stories - thinking about them freak me out all over again. I am happy to report that once we moved everything returned to normal for us. I did, however, upon moving tell "Ernie" (as my husband named him) that he had to stay there and we did not want him to come with us. I'm sure he's still there - haunting the next unsuspecting victim to move in there.

Interesting story, I think.  Naming ghosts always seems to rob them of their dignity and make them less scary.  So if you have one, start calling him Ernie and he'll seem less threatening.  Still a good story.
