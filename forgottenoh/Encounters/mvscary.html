Occasionally a story really gets under your skin.  This tale of an outing to the <a href = "http://www.geocities.com/forgottenohio/moonville.html">Moonville Tunnel</a> really gives me the willies about night trips to the Hocking Hills.

During the fall last year, a bunch of my friends and I went out to 
investigate the Moonville Tunnel. My dad worked on the railroad in his earlier years 
and was telling me about the story long before I even thought about going to the tunnel. 
<p>
Well to get to the point, on our first few visits out to the tunnel, nothing was out of the 
ordinary. The next time we visited the tunnel was a totally different story!!! We had 
already walked through the tunnel and was on the other side, walking down the path. 
Nobody was wanting to walk in the back, so I being the brave sole I am, decided to 
get in back, as long as one of my buddies walked beside me. So Nalin and I were 
walking behind the rest of our friends when he jokingly told me to watch out for the 
guy behind me. He was totally joking. We both just laughed but I, of course, kept 
looking over my shoulder for the "guy" following me. Of course, nothing was there. 
<p>
About 5 or 6 minutes later we were still walking on the path away from the tunnel and 
both Nalin and I were still bringing up the rear. I turned my head around to look behind 
me when I saw the scariest thing I've ever experienced in my entire life! It scared me to 
death. I didn't know if I was seeing something or not. I tried to say something to Nalin, 
and I couldn't even talk! I simply grabbed him and turned him around. As soon as I saw 
the look on his face, I knew I wasn't imagining seeing the ghostly figure. We turned and 
ran as fast as we could nearly knocking everybody down in our path. When we looked 
back, the figure appeared to be getting closer to us. We kept running and the next time 
we checked for the "ghost", nothing was there. 
<p>
I am certain that the Moonville ghost is 
still roaming the woods behind the tunnel. I haven't experience the headless man in the 
tunnel but I surely experienced something that wasn't of the norm.

Is it true?  I have no reason to doubt the guy.  Scary stuff, though; you usually feel so secure in a large group....
