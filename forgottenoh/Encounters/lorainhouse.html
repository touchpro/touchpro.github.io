We are changing my brother's room around and it seems that the ghost in 
our 
house doesn't like change.Something keeps knocking on his door from the 
inside of his room while we are in the living room watching tv.My 
brother 
gets up to check it out
and it stops knocking.Something similar happened when we took off 
posters in 
his
room.We heard someone making weird sounds before,like a mentally ill 
teenager.
We've seen dolls in our Mom's china cabinet looking at us.I've seen a 
green 
light travel through our living room.My brother's speakers have been 
thrown 
across the room.Doors have opened and closed by themselves.
<p>
I help my aunt clean a church somewhere in lorain county(where i 
live).It's 
definetly
haunted.We've heard whistling and loud thumping noises.I was at the top 
floor 
of the
church while my aunt was on the elevater and I heard sucking noises 
near my 
ears.
<p>
Your site is great.I really liked the story on gore orphaneage.I live 
about 
20 minutes 
away from it.My friends Mom has a friend that lives down the street 
from it.

I think it would be great that you entered my story into your site.  
Even 
though I am fascinated with ghosts, the one in our house has scared us.  
We 
even have a cousin that comes & stays with us from time to time, and he 
has 
even heard and seen things.  For the longest of time, we could hear 
heavy 
breathing in our house, real close to us.  That scared us.  My Mom even 
went 
to a fortune teller (which was supposed to be just for fun).  It turns 
out 
that when my Mom went to her, she told my Mom that our house was 
haunted and 
that my little sister (who was 3 years old at the time) was very scared 
of 
the spirits here and that we had to burn sandalwood incense all through 
our 
house.  My Mom just laughed about it, until one day my sister told my 
Mom 
that she saw 3 things come up the stairs.  She thought they were people 
in 
black hoods and you couldn't see their faces, and they carried candles 
up the 
stairs and disappeared.  We all went around burning sandalwood after 
that.  
We still hear things every once in a while, but we don't see or hear 
anything 
too scary like that anymore.
