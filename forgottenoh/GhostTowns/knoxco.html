Knox County, northeast of Columbus, is home to Centerburg, the geographic center of Ohio, as well as the towns of Mt. Vernon and Gambier.  I used to drive up into it a few times a week to visit my girlfriend, who was incarcerated at Mt. Vernon Nazarene College.  Lots of little towns died slow deaths in Knox County; you can read about many of them below.

Academia
<dd>
Morris Twp.
<dd>
Town located in the very northwest corner of the county.  Post office operated here between 1901 and 1906.
<dt>
Ball
<dd>
Post office operated between August 9, 1850 and December 19, 1850.
<dt>
Banning's Mill
<dd>
Founded by William Douglas in spring 1805 when he began building the sawmill and gristmill.
<dt>
Cavallo
<dd>
Union Twp.
<dd>
At one time a major trade center, Cavallo's life depended on the canals, and when the railroads replaced them, it died.  The town's best years were between 1840 and 1850, when it handled most of Knox County's imports and exports via a feeder canal which followed the Mohican River to the Ohio Canal between Coshocton and Walhondling.  One of the biggest grain elevators in central Ohio was constructed at the mouth of the feeder, which was used as late as 1881.  At its peak Cavallo boasted four large warehouses.  The exact location of the town is in dispute; depending on who you believe, it was either on the west side of the Mohican River in Knox County or the east side in Coshocton County.

Clark's Crossroads
<dd>

Clinton
<dd>
Clinton Twp.
<dd>
The first real town in Knox County.  Clinton boasted the county's first post office, which was established in 1804.  Clinton was slowly murdered by Mt. Vernon, which seemed to deliberately strangle it out of existence.  When the county commissioners travelled through candidate towns to decide the placement of the county seat, the people of Mt. Vernon put on a show much like the end of the movie <i>Funny Farm</i>:  they cleaned everything up, acted like they were all working hard, and took care of the commissioners in the town's best hotel.  Then, when the commissioners left for Clinton, the town's worst drunks and vandals ran ahead of them and trashed Clinton, scaring the crap out of the commissioners and convincing them that Mt. Vernon was the place to put the courthouse.  This was the beginning of the end for Clinton, which then made a series of attempts to stay viable.  They petitioned for the incorporation of the Clinton Library and Academy; the petition was rejected several times, while Mt. Vernon established its own colleges.  In 1809 the Mt. Zion Masonic Lodge was established in Clinton; in 1815 Mt. Vernon erected a new lodge building and the meetings were moved there.  In July of 1813 <i>The Ohio Register</i> began printing in Clinton; in 1816 it moved to Mt. Vernon.  In 1818, residents petitioned for vacation of a large portion of the town.  All I can say is, I hope Mt. Vernon is happy.

It disappeared sometime after 1881.

<dt>
Ten Mile Settlement
<dd>
Clinton Twp.
<dd>
Town established in 1805 when several settlers from Ten Mile, Washington County, Pennsylvania settled south of Owl Creek.  The first gristmill in Knox County was located here, at the point where Granville Road crosses the tributary, but it was built at a place where the water often ran dry, so it could only operate right after a heavy rain.  An amusing figure local to Ten Mile Settlement was Henry Haines, who was appointed County Treasurer from 1808 to 1815.  Shortly after his last term in office Haines became "deranged" and became and "exhorter" for a religious denomination known as the New Lights.  He rode around the countryside day and night screaming at people to repent and prepare for judgment.  He was cured several times by the local doctor but would always disappear again and go back to screaming at people.  The last time they found him he was hanging from a tree.  Sounds like the perfect setup for a haunting--on lonely nights some say you can still hear him screaming....
