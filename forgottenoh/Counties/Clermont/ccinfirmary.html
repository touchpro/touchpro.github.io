Serving alternately as a mental hospital, nursing home, poorhouse, and nursery for orphan babies, the Clermont County Infirmary saw plenty of suffering in its century-plus lifetime.  It was built in 1883 and demolished in the late fall of 2001.  Occupants were often buried in the potter's field nearby, which is today covered by the haunted <a href = "womensjail.html">women's jail</a>.
<p>
Ghosts were seen often at the infirmary before it we knocked down, especially after it was closed down.  Dishevelled women and men were seen in the windows, and lights flickered in upstairs rooms even though the power was cut.
