A church cemetery south of Cadiz is the location of the desecrated statue of a Civil War soldier.  Angry at having his sword broken, the soldier turns his head in different directions.  Turning his head seems a little ineffectual to me; wouldn't it be scarier if he came to life and wreaked vengeance on the town of Cadiz, impervious to bullets and out for blood?
