The case of the haunted Taco Bell in Twinsburg is reminiscent of the famous Toys R Us in Sunnydale, California.  An old cemetery was relocated before they this fast food restaurant was built, but it's theorized that a few of the bodies might have been missed in the rush to develop.  Now somber figures are seen in the hallways, behind the counter, in the dining area.  Sometimes they're seen after hours and are pursued, only to disappear.
