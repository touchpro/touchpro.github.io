At least two distinct hauntings take place at this Catholic high school in Akron.  In the art, tutoring, and admissions sections--all of the rooms which occupy the old Brothers’ dormitory--ghostly men in black priests’ robes somberly walk the halls.

A basketball player at Hoban was killed in a car accident in the late 1980s, and his ghost still angrily occupies the boys’ locker room, slamming lockers and appearing, gaunt and pale, to the occasional student unfortunate enough to linger in the locker room alone.
