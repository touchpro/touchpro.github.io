Hower House
<dd>
This building is said to be haunted by a female ghost--reportedly one of the Howers, who, angry at her husband's infidelity, likes to burn men.  I think I used to date her.  Watch out.

<dt>
TKE Fraternity House
<dd>
Also haunted at U. Akron is the TKE fraternity house.  Its ghost is that of a servant girl who died when the house was still a private residence.  Her body is buried in a hard-to-find grave in the back yard, but her ghost roams the house and grounds.
