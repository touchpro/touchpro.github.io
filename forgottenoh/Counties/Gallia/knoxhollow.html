Knox Hollow, between Bidwell and Vinton, is haunted by the ghosts of twins who drowned in the creek there.  They couldn't swim, according to legend, but one night wandered together to the creek while sleepwalking and began to paddle around.  When their father saw them he yelled at them, waking them up, and they drowned.
