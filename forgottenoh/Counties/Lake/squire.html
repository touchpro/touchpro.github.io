Fergus B. Squire built Squire's Castle as a caretaker's home while he built the <i>real</i> castle, which was never completed.  He lived in the caretaker's cottage while he was preparing to build the main house.  One night his wife was found dead on the basement steps with her neck broken.  Under suspicion, Squire left.  He sold his land in 1922.  Later the Cleveland Metroparks system purchased it and the land around it.  They stripped out the interior and filled the basement in with cement, but the castle still stands on the park land, and it's said that sometimes you can hear screams coming from inside it; sometimes you can see a mysterious light pass in front of one of the windows.
<p>
Another version of this story has it that Mrs. Squire was a sleepwalker, and on the fatal night she was awakened from a by the howling of wolves in the woods nearby.  Panicked by waking up in a strange place, she ran down the basement stairs and somehow accidentally slipped her head through a loop of hemp hanging from a high shelf.  She tripped and hung herself and that's how Fergus found her in the morning.

Guides and park historians are quick to debunk the Squire's Castle legends, which they consider a nuisance.  The Squires never actually lived in the building at all, they say.  But the spooky atmosphere of the turreted castle standing near the woods of the Cuyahoga Valley, particularly on a moonlit night, ensures that the stories maintain a life of their own no matter how farfetched Metroparks workers say they are.
<p>
The Squire Castle is often mistakenly placed inside the borders of Cleveland, mainly because it's so often included with the most famous Forest City hauntings, but it actually stands outside of Cuyahoga County altogether, in the suburb of Willoughby Hills.
