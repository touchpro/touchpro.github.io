Rider's 1812 Inn in Painesville is haunted by the ghost of "the ugliest woman in Painesville," Mistress Suzanne.  It's said that she was probably killed by her third husband, Joseph Rider, the guy who built the Inn.  He married her in 1834, most likely for her money, and she died just six weeks later under "mysterious circumstances."  She's apparently not bitter, though, because she's a very friendly and helpful ghost.  Rather than feeling cold spots in the Inn, people report feeling warm and happy there.
