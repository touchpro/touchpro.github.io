At <a href = "http://www.lakeerie.edu">Lake Erie College</a> in Painesville, the old Morley Music Hall is haunted by a lady in a long white gown who floats down the staircase, thought to be one of the Morleys after whom the building is named.  The story got so notorious that the college closed the building to the public and started using it for storage.  Today it's said that if you go inside you will feel the lady's presence.
