This old cemetery in Evansport has a long entrance lined with overhanging trees.  If you walk the path toward the cemetery, you might see a glow coming from just inside the gates, but it will disappear by the time you reach it.  The specter of old Mr. Buck has also been known to hover above people when they first enter the cemetery.  There's some debate about who Mr. Buck really was.  Some say he was a cemetery guard/caretaker, while others say he was a horse thief who was hung there from a big oak tree.  On moonlit lights you might be able to see him hanging.
