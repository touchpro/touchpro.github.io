Simon Girty was adopted by the Seneca as a young man and sided with the British to fight the Revolutionaries in the Ohio Territory.  He was present at the death of Colonel Crawford, which was supposed to be extremely gruesome.
<p>
Because he was such a bad guy, he's doomed to spend eternity polishing Mad Anthony Wayne's cannons, which once stood at the eastern point of Girty's Island, seven miles west of Napoleon.  Although the cannons were removed long ago, Girty appears every night to polish the places where they once stood.
