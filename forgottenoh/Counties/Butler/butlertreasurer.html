The ghost of a former night watchman has made appearances at the Butler County Treasurer's Office, where he was killed in a robbery in the 1860's.  The robbers hung his body from a rafter to make it look like suicide but had actually killed him with ether.  In 1893 he appeared to a county employee by making the clock chime 21 times and materializing on the face.  Maybe he still hangs around.
