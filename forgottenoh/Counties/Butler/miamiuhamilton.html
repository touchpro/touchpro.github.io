The Hamilton branch of <a href = "http://www.miamiu.edu">Miami U.</a> is said to be haunted, particularly the fourth floor of Mosler Hall.  It isn't easy to pin down anything more specific than that, but friend-of-the-site Kyle helped a lot by sending along an account of his own experiences:
<p>
<font color = "yellow">
"I am a graduate of miami University Hamilton of 6 years.  I was a tech support worker, and I have covered every inch of the campus, as well as many locations in the Oxford branch.  Both have numerous haunted locations.  On the Hamilton campus--fourth floor Mosler is, in my opinion, haunted.  I have smelled sulfur long after the classes have ended, sometimes weeks after--and it's only that floor.  
<p>
"Also, doors lock and unlock randomly.  Once when I was in the process of moving equipment on the south side of the fourth floor, I locked the door (I was the only person who had a key to that door), and came back five minutes later to find the door wide open and still locked.  It was a really heavy door and it required a lot of effort to open and never stayed open.  
<p>
"Additionally, the theater is haunted.  The contractor who designed the audio system there died of a heart attack in the theater.  I have used a ouija board in the parking lot and I got activity from the same man, the contractor who died in the theater.  My father, who was the manager of the campus, worked in the theater regularly; he's had the lights turned on and off on him when no one else was there.  This happened when the theater building was locked, early in the morning."
<font color = "white">
<p>
Quite a range of occurrences.  I'd be interested to see confirmation of the contractor's deadly heart attack in the auditorium--a news clipping, perhaps?  Still, it remains an intriguing case.
