Take Route 732 north out of Oxford and turn left onto the first country road--Buckley Road.  Drive to the place where the road curves, turn your car around, and face 732.  If you now turn your engine off, flash your headlights three times, and wait, you will see a white light come toward your car from across the hills.
<p>
This, according to the story, is the ghost of a bicyclist who was struck by a car and killed while riding on either 732 or Buckley Road one evening.  Now he performs on command, if you're brave enough to summon him up.
