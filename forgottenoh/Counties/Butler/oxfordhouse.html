This story might no longer apply, because I'm told that the house may have been torn down, but at one time there was an abandoned house near the Miami of Ohio campus in Oxford with a ghost story attached to it.  According to legend, the girl who lived there fell in love with a guy her parents didn't approve of.  They planned to elope one night in the middle of a thunderstorm, but her lover lost control on the way there, wrecked, and was decapitated in the field across from her house.  The girl later hung herself in the house in grief.  The legend (if the house still exists) is that you should pull into the driveway of the abandoned house, flash your lights three times, and the pull back around, you'll see ghostly headlights coming down the road toward you.
