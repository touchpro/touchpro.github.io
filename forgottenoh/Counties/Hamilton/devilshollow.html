Another hell mouth is supposed to exist in Blue Ash, part of greater Cincinnati in the northeastern part of Hamilton County.  It's a drainage system similar to Columbus's <a href = "../../Drains/gates.html">Gates of Hell</a>.  Apparently the mazelike tunnel gets smaller and smaller, is decorated with very creative and eerie graffiti, and leads to a spot where--legend has it--satanists performed a dark rite and opened a portal to hell.  Spooky goings-on in and around the Devil's Hollow drainage system are often attributed to this demonic fact.
