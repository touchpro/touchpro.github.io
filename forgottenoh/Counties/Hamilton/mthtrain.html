The city of Mt. Healthy, which changed its name from Mt. Pleasant after surviving a cholera epidemic, is haunted by the ghostly sounds of train whistles.  They are most audible in the alleyways at night.  Some say that Mt. Healthy residents instituted their own brutal sort of quarantine during the outbreak, not allowing new people in or out...or the trains to stop.  Maybe there are sick people riding that spectral locomotive.
