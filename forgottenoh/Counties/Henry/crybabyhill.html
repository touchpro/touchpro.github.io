A Cry Baby Hill (not bridge this time) exists in the Henry County town of McClure.  The story behind it is vague; it involves a large number of babies which were massacred either on the hill or somewhere else and then buried on the hill.  A dozen or so unreadable tombstones dot the hill, which is located on County Road 7.  The cries of babies are said to be audible there at night.  Sometimes unidentified things are heard crawling along the ground.  Kind of grisly.
