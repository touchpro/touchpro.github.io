The very old Deshler Station bar and restaurant in tiny Deshler, Ohio, is plagued by ghostly occurrences.  Built at the turn of the twentieth century, the building was used as a hotel under various names until 1976.  These days patrons and employees report the same unexplainable things:  cold spots, odd drafts of air, footsteps on the vacant second floor.  The ghosts of two old men are sometimes seen seated at the bar after hours.
