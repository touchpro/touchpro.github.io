Located near a local crybaby bridge is Palmer Cemetery.  The cemetery is said to be haunted for some reason.  Supposedly it's a very creepy area.  I'd appreciate more info on this one; my Mercer County hauntings are pretty thin.
<p>
To find it, go north on Route 27 out of Celina, past the Mercer Truck Stop, and make a right at a rundown motel.  When this road ends, make a left onto Palmers Road.  The cemetery will be on the left.  A little further on Palmers Road is the crybaby bridge.  Make the next right and then the next left and go down this road (Tomlinson Road) and you'll find another cemetery and an abandoned church--an added bonus.
