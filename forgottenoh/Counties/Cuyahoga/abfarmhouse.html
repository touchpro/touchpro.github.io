The abandoned farmhouse on the old Edmund Gleason farm in Valley View is said by locals to be haunted.  The legend says an eccentric woman used to farm the land.  She would dress as a man and raise her pigs in the barn.
<p>
The place has been unoccupied since 1987.  Today strange lights are seen in the upstairs windows from time to time.  The ghost of the cross-dressing woman?  Maybe.
<p>
The farmhouse, which is located at the intersection of Tinker's Creek Road and Canal Road in Valley View, has a dilapidated barn behind it which was the scene of a very real tragedy in the summer of 2002 when a young man killed himself there.  Now the National Parks Service has plans to renovate the house; if you want to check it out you should do it before much longer.
