The Metroparks Zoo in Cleveland has a couple of its own ghosts to spook the employees and animals at night.  A man supposedly died in the creek that runs through the zoo; he is glimpsed standing on a bridge.  The wolf exhibit is haunted by the ghost of a suicide--a man who flung himself from a high footbridge and met his end in the place where the wolves are now housed.  The howls that come from that area aren't always canine in origin, if the stories are true.
