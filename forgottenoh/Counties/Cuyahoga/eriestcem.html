The Indian Joc-o-Sot, a Sauk chief, is buried in Erie Cemetery in Cleveland.  He was on his way back from Europe, where he'd been touring with a Wild West show, after becoming ill again from an old bullet wound from the 1831 Black Hawk Wars.  He wanted to live long enough be buried back home in Wisconsin or Minnesota, but he didn't make it any further than Cleveland, and in those early days before embalming fluid, you usually got buried where you died.  Today his spirit wanders the graveyard, still mad about being buried in a strange place, and maybe a little bit pissed about the Cleveland Indians' mascot Chief Wahoo; he sometimes haunts the stadium right across the street from where he's buried, beneath a tombstone cracked by his rage.
<p>
Also buried here is another Indian from Buffalo Bill's show:  Chief Thunderwater, who was sometimes called "The Official Cleveland Indian" and may have been the inspiration for Chief Wahoo.  At least that's what the Find-a-Grave website says.  It turns out that the Indians were named in honor of Louis "Chief" Sockalexis, a Penobscot Indian who played for the team then known as the Cleveland Spiders, circa 1912.
