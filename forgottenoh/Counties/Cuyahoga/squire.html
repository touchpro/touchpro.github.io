Fergus B. Squire built Squire's Castle as a caretaker's home while he built the <i>real</i> castle, which was never completed.  He lived in the caretaker's cottage while he was preparing to build the main house.  One night his wife was found dead on the basement steps with her neck broken.  Under suspicion, Squire left.  He sold his land in 1922.  Later the Cleveland Metroparks system purchased it and the land around it.  They stripped out the interior and filled the basement in with cement, but the castle still stands on the park land, and it's said that sometimes you can hear screams coming from inside it; sometimes you can see a mysterious light pass in front of one of the windows.
