In a very rural part of Trumbull County there stands an abandoned house with a small Cathoilc shrine nearby.  The house was an inn in the 19th Century, when a nameless traveller grew sick and died there.  The owner refused his request of a priest to deliver last rites, so that the man died unblessed.  Almost immediately, poltergeist activity overtook the house, tormenting the innkeeper.  Strange lights, the sound of an invisible galloping horse, and breaking dishes were some of the phenomena; later, his barn burned and his cattle died of a mysterious illness.  Shaken to the core, he finally gave the building and the land to the church, but not before putting up a small shrine.  A priest visits this shrine once a year to say Mass.
