Medina's Spitzer House Bed and Breakfast was built in 1890 by banker Ceilan Milo Spitzer.  Today, a haunted room in the building is called Ceilan's Room.  Two men can be heard talking in the dining room when no one is there.  And, most eerily, Anna's Room is haunted by the ghost of a retarded servant girl who appears with some regularity.
