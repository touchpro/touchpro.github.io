This very small town in SW Medina County has one or two lantern-carrying ghosts in its local cemetery.  Spencer Cemetery is just east of the town center.  Strange things are reported there from time to time--chiefly the bizarre sight of an actual, metal, real-world lantern floating free in the air as if held by invisible hands.  People have approached the lantern and passed their hands above, beneath, and around it, finding no strings or apparent trickery of any kind.  Sometimes a smaller lantern is seen floating near the original.
