Three ghostly lights can be seen at the Stone Quarry along the Tuscarawas River in New Philadelphia at night--two red and one white, which seems kind of racist, since they're the ghosts of a 1770s Mingo Indian chief, his Indian lover, and the white wife whom he abandoned.  The spurned lover tracked the two down and shoved them off the cliff there, getting pulled down with them.  They were refused a Christian burial, though, so to this day their ghosts reenact their final moments every night, with the three lights struggling and then falling to the river below, where they go out like embers in the water.
