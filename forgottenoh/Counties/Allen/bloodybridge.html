Spencerville's Bloody Bridge spans the old Miami-Erie canal bed seven miles south of town on Route 66. It is named after the bloodstain left when a man named Bill killed Jack and Minnie, who were lovers. Minnie, the daughter of a canal boat captain, fell in love with Jack, while Bill fell in love with her. Since he couldn't have her he killed both of them with an axe. Years later, a skeleton and an axe head were found in the bottom of a well. 
<p>
The original bridge was replaced in 1904. The new one is, appropriately enough, painted red. If you cross it, it's said that you might catch a glimpse of Minnie's face in the water below. This story is a very famous one in the Lima area, one that's recounted every October and written up for Halloween stories.
