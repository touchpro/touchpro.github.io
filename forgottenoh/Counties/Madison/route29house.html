North of London, near the intersection of State Routes 29 and 38, there is a clearing where a house used to stand.  You can find it by following the old tree line where the driveway used to be.  The house burned down, killing the family who lived there while they slept.  It's said around London that on certain nights you can see the outline of the house shimmering in the moonlight above the old scorched plot.
