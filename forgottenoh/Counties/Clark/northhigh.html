Two ghosts--a boy and a girl--occupy the auditorium of Springfield North High School.  The school was built on land that was once used as a burial ground for the children's home across the road.  While they made an attempt to move all the graves, two were never found.  Their bodies are still buried beneath the auditorium stage, and their ghosts still haunt this part of the high school.
