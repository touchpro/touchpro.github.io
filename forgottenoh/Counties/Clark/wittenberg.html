Myers Hall
<DD>
During the Civil War, the building now known as Myers Hall was a hospital for wounded soldiers.  One patient's dying wish was to see his horse, so they brought it inside to his bedside.  After he died, the horse refused to leave his side, no matter how much they tried to get it to move out of the room.  Finally the hospital had it shot.  Ever since, the horse's ghost is said to clip-clop through Myers Hall.
