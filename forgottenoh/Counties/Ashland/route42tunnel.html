Just off Route 42 on the way to Mansfield from Ashland is a tunnel which is supposed to be haunted by a ghost or group of ghosts.  They will push your car through the tunnel if you shut the engine off and put it in neutral.  If you honk your horn three times you might see the hanging body of a man who killed himself there after his wife died giving birth.  Their home was located near the tunnel but was burned to the ground by vandals.  To find the tunnel on 42, look for the offices of an exterminating company.
