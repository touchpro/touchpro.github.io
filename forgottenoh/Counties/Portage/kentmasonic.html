The Kent Masonic Temple is the former home of Kent founding father Marvin Kent.  His wife, Kitty Kent, was burned alive in the house by the kerosene stove on the third floor and haunts it today.  She sometimes leaves scratch marks across the surface of a favorite French mirror.  Also present at the temple is the ghost of Nellie Dingley, the first librarian to work in the Kent Free Library housed there.  She died as a nurse in World War One.
