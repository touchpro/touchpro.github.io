<a href = "http://www.hiram.edu/">Hiram College</a> in Portage County, famously the institution James A. Garfield served as president of before being elected President of the entire nation, has an enigmatic chapel on its grounds.  Supposedly it was shut down after two suicides took place there in rapid succession:  first a girl hung herself there, then a male student slit his own throat.  Now people hear loud noises and movement inside, despite the fact that it is always locked.  Lights will go on and off at all hours of the night for no reason.
