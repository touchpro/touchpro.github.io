Chester Bedell was an aggressive and unrepentant atheist who challenged God to prove His existence.  On his deathbed he asked that his grave be infested with snakes if God were real.  As you may have guessed, gravediggers had trouble burying Chester because of the unusual number of snakes.  Now they crawl in and out, around his tombstone and underneath it, a living demonstration of how wrong Chester apparently was.  His cursed grave is in a small cemetery off SR 14.
