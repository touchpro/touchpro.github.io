Some of Fayette County's genealogical records are stored at the official archives in Washington Courthouse.  A ghost knocks boxes off the shelves on occasion and fills the air with fragrant pipe smoke.  He is supposed to be the ghost of a National Guard soldier who was left in Ohio when the rest of his regiment left to fight in World War One.  Apparently his health was too poor to allow them to bring him along to fight in the harsh winter weather.  Despondent over being left all alone, he took his own life in the armory building where the Guard stayed.  Today that building houses offices for the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the records archive.
