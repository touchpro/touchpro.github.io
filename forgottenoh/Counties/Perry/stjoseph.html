Saint Joseph's in Somerset is the oldest Catholic church in the state of Ohio.  It sits on a slight hill and is very impressive, with an ancient graveyard out back.  Many of the early burials there were immigrants from Ireland, born in years that began with a 17.  So many stones broke off that they are piled in places, barely readable.
<P>
The ghost that haunts (or once haunted) the church is that of a priest who once resided at the church.  After his death he was seen around the halls, and the candles on the altar would sometimes be extinguished mysteriously.  The priests at the church began to dedicate their masses to "an unknown intention" of his, and the manifestations dropped off.  Still, the place is very eerie, especially at night.  Could it still be haunted?
