<br>
<a href = "http://www.kenyon.edu">Kenyon College</a> is a respected Ohio college, the second-oldest in the state.  Several illustrious Ohioans got their educations on its beautiful grounds, including president Rutherford B. Hayes.  Kenyon also has one of the most haunted campuses around.

Campus Gates
<dd>
The main gates of Kenyon are said to have been built atop the "Hellmouth."  No ghosts, exactly, but that does give the place a sinister sort of reputation.

Norton Hall
<dd>
A ghostly insomniac who committed suicide paces the halls of this building.
<br>
<br>
<dt>
Manning Hall
<dd>
A frustrated student who died before she could attend classes rearranges furniture in this building.
<br>
<br>
<dt>
Lewis Hall
<dd>
A freshman who hanged himself in the attic of this building turns lights on and off and flushes toilets.
<br>

Wertheimer Hall
<dd>
The physical recreation center at Kenyon is haunted by a ghost who likes to stay in shape; he's heard running on the track and playing ghostly music in the supplies cage.
<br>
<br>
<dt>
Hill Theater
<dd>
Built on the site of a drunk driving fatality, Hill Theater is haunted by a ghost who unscrews lightbulbs and opens the curtains when no one is around.

Shaffer Hall
<dd>
Now Shaffer Dance Studio, this building once housed a swimming pool in which--legend has it--a student drowned after banging his head on the glass ceiling.  The ghost would say things to swimmers and sometimes make splashing sounds when no one was in the pool.  Today, a ghostly diving board can be heard in the Dance Studio, and a face with the hair slicked back is seen peering out of a small window.

Caples Hall
<dd>
The ghost of a student who died in the elevator shaft bothers girls in Caples Hall.  One story is that he was pushed; another is that he fell when he deliberately climbed into the shaft as part of some sort of prank.  Either way, his spirit hangs around, appearing mostly to girls--perhaps out of animosity toward his girlfriend, who he was there to visit and who later felt icy hands on her face in her sleep and found her door blocked by her dresser on different occasions.

Delta Kappa Epsilon
<dd>
In 1905 Stuart Pierson was killed while pledging to this fraternity; he was struck by a train as he waited on a trestle over the Kokosing River.  Every year on October 28, his ghost is said to stare out of a window as the train passes.  Confined to the fourth floor, he opens and closes windows and causes footsteps overhead--where there is no floor.

<dt>
Dorms
<dd>
Victims of the Kenyon Fire of 1949 haunt the main dorm at Kenyon, gliding legless down first floor halls, flipping lights on and off, and flushing toilets.  A student who had occupied a room where a student had been trapped (the building was later rebuilt) heard poundings and a voice saying "Get me out!"  There were nine victims of the fire, and all nine seem pretty pissed off--they sometims leave candles smoldering next to 1949 yearbooks with the pages open to the names of the victims.  Creepy stuff.
