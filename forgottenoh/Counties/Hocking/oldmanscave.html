Old Man Rowe, the namesake of Old Man's Cave, is supposed to haunt the entrance to the cave, guarding his buried treasure.  Old Man's Cave is something of a misnomer, however, since it's not a cave but an area in the Hocking Hills full of sandstone cliffs and chasms.
<p>
Salt Pete is a triple-decker cave located in the Old Man's Cave region.  A man named Charlie chopped off his wife's head and that of her lover and threw them from the top.  His ghost can be heard chopping wood there at night.
