The wooded area surrounding Rushcreek near Berne Union High School is the site of regular visits by a headless woman.  She carries her head under one arm as she makes her way through the woods on certain foggy nights.  No one is entirely certain who she is, but she's been appearing here since at least the 1920s or 30s.
<p>
The Rushcreek area is also home to its very own monster, which has not been seen by anyone who has lived to tell the tale, but once scared some hunting dogs rather badly, and is known to claw up the sides of vehicles left parked near the woods.
