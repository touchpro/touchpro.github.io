An abandoned house near Slate Run Metropark in Lithopolis is said to be haunted by the ghost of a girl who killed her family and then hung herself, as well as the parents she did away with.  Supposedly she hung her dad in the bell tower and also killed her baby brother or sister in the barn.  White figures are sometimes seen in the doorways and windows, and occasionally the ghosts will touch you.  I have heard from a number of people who have had encounters at this house.
