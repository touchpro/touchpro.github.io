The "blue light" haunting is an elusive bit of local ghostlore which has been erroneously assigned to various bridges around Sugar Grove.  Sometimes it's mentioned in connection with the <a href = "johnson.html">Johnson Covered Bridge</a> in <a href = "../../Revenge/revenge.html">Revenge</a>, but it turns out that the Johnson bridge has its own ghost stories, involving a different ghostly woman.
<p>
The haunting actually belongs to the Hummell Bridge on Hansley Road.  This strip of pavement and rusty steel spans steep embankments above Rush Creek.  Creepy and isolated though it is, in an earlier era it was even more so.  The structure was originally a covered bridge where young lovers often went to be alone together.
<p>
One such couple in the 1930s included a woman from Sugar Grove named either Mary or Anna.  She and her boyfriend seemed to fight all the time.  Maybe he was cheating on her, or maybe it was just typical relationship stuff, but one day Mary (or Anna) had had enough.  They were parked at the Hummell Bridge that night.  She took a knife out of her purse and sliced her lover's throat from ear to ear, then proceeded to hack his head completely off.
<p>
She took his head onto a hill just west of the bridge and talked to it long into the night.  Then she slit her own throat.  They found her body, along with the chopped-up body of her boyfriend, the next day at the bottom of the hill.

Ever since then, Mary/Anna's ghost has appeared on moonless night in the vicinity of the Hummell Bridge.  If you call to her (by the proper name, I assume), she'll appear, bathed in an eerie blue light.  She roams the hills nearby, but like many ghosts she seems to be most fond of reenacting her final moments, carrying her lover's head along with the knife she used to cut it off.
<p>
Recently, Dawn from Millfield visited the Hummell Bridge late one night and was surprised to find her car enveloped in a sudden, thick fog.  She saw a figure--masculine, she thought, but she wasn't sure--walking up from the riverside toward her car.  Dawn did the smart thing and took off, so she never found out who the figure was, but it seems clear that strange things still happen at Sugar Grove's haunted bridge.
