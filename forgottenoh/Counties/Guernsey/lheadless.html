The woods surrounding the Guernsey County town of Londonerry are haunted by a headless figure.  Years ago, thieves saw him flashing money around town and followed him into the woods where he camped that night.  His horse was found a few days later, but his body never was.  Today his headless body wanders the woods, apparently looking for revenge.
