A headless ghost haunts a stretch of old US 40 in Guernsey County, under which his body is said to lie.  A worker on the National Road, he was murdered for his saved paychecks, and today frightens motorists by stumbling in front of their cars at night in the Deep Cut section of Route 40, which is located between Old Washington and Cambridge.
