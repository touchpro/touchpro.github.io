Sometimes known as The House on the Hill, this huge home was constructed in the 1870s for Colonel Joseph D. Taylor--teacher, lawyer, prosecutor, soldier, bank and newspaper owner, and all-around prominent Cambridge citizen.  Guests in the house have included Ohio presidents Garfield, Hayes, and McKinley.  Now it hosts weddings, receptions, banquets, and fundraisers.  At 9,000 square feet and 21 rooms (with six bathrooms), there's plenty of room for events of all kinds.

According to some, Colonel Taylor himself never left, even though he's been dead for nearly a hundred years.  The smell of his tobacco smoke lingers in rooms he used to frequent, and his ghost walks up and down the main staircase.  Usually it's nothing more than the sound of footsteps on the risers, but once in a while his spirit form actually materializes there.
