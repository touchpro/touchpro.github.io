The Chadwick Inn was built in 1837 by Levi Beebe, who turned it into a kind of old-time mall complete with feed store, post office, and general store.  Stagecoaches stopped at it and the passengers did their shopping.  Later, in the 1930's, it was a brothel.  It is haunted by a woman who is seen hanging from the rafters with a noose around her neck, and a man called Levi, after the original owner, who likes to drink Jack Daniels.
