Joy Cemetery (ironic name, huh?) in Ottawa Hills is supposed to be haunted by a lake-boat captain who stumps around looking for his missing wooden leg.  If you do see him he shouldn't be too hard to run away from.
<p>
I tried to go visit the captain, but couldn't find Joy Cemetery in Ottawa Hills.  There is a huge cemetery there, but Joy isn't it's name.  Since then I've gotten directions and hope to head back up there sometime.
