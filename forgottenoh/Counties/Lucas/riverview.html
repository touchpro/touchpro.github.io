Years ago (the stories say) a woman committed suicide by jumping from a window in the bar of this Toledo hotel.  Her spirit now haunts the entire complex.  Anomalies attributed to her include the moving of items in the bar; ripples in the pool caught on a security camera at night; anonymous knocking on the penthouse doors; and the feeling of a cold hand on guests' backs.  A promotional pamphlet put out by the hotel was supposed to inadvertently contain the outline of her face.  If you want a better look at her, you can try to catch a glimpse of her in the bar mirrors, where she sometimes appears.
