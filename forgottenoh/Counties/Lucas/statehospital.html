Toledo's old State Hospital is haunted by number of ghosts.  Cell doors open and close; ghosts float down the halls.  This is one I really wanted to visit; Columbus's State Hospital, which was very haunted, was demolished about ten years ago and replaced with a huge modern-looking facility.  Unfortunately, I recently learned that Toledo's State Hospital met the wrecking ball not long ago.  A few of its smaller buildings still stand, though.
