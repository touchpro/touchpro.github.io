It's actually the field beside this west side primary school which hosts the paranormal presence, and it's a weird one:  a half-woman, half-horse creature something like a Minotaur.  The more skeptical sometimes describe it as a woman <i>astride</i> a horse, but the monster claims persist.  Other ghosts might be present, since they are supposedly angry about having their cemetery moved improperly when an industrial complex moved in in the late '60s/early '70s.  It went out of business, but the denizens of the cemetery (at least some of whom are said to have been left in the ground here) are still unhappy.  They seem to avoid the school itself, however, and walk--or gallop--in the vacant lot next door.
