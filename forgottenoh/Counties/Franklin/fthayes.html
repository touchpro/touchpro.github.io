Now an alternative-type high school in Columbus, the school building at Fort Hayes was once part of the military post.  It's commonly referred to as the Shot Tower, but in actuality it was never used for that; the floors in the tower would block shot from being poured.  (For a look at a <i>real</i> shot tower, check out the <a href = "../../Peters/peters.html">Peters Cartridge Co.</a>)
<p>
In 1865 a private was killed by an overheated cannon fired for Abraham Lincoln's funeral train's passage through Columbus.  The soldier was supposedly killed by his commander, whose daughter he was in love with.  There is also a ghost in a World War Two uniform that haunts the school.
<p>
Fort Hayes also happens to be surrounded by some great abandoned buildings from its military days which I've profiled <a href = "../../FortHayes/forthayes.html">here</a>.  The <a href = "../../FortHayes/drillhall.html">Drill Hall</a> is home to the Fort's other ghost.
