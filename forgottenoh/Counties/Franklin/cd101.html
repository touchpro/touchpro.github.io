CD101, 101.1 FM in Columbus, is headquartered in the old Worley Plumbing building in the Brewery District.  Long ago, part of the building was used as a stable for workhorses.  When it caught fire, a woman was killed.  Today the woman is seen occasionally in the studio, especially late at night when the overnight deejay is there alone.  
<p>
A former deejay at CD101 brought her daughter to work with her one day and ended up having an encounter with the ghost.  Her daugher was asleep on the floor when a heavy piece of station equipment nearly fell on her; her mom was holding it up, trying to wake her, because the thing was so heavy it would likely have killed the little girl.  She woke up and moved just in time.  Later, she asked her mom who the lady was who had woken her up; it wasn't her mom, it was a different lady, who kept telling her to get up and move.
<p>
So the ghost may have saved someone's life.  At least it's friendly.
