The state library off of Fourth Street north of downtown Columbus is said by employees to be haunted.  My then-girlfriend and I stumbled across this building by accident and couldn't believe it was what the cheap paper sign out front says it is:  State Library.  The main library, of course, is on Grant Street, so what do they do here?  My guess it that it's mainly records and stuff the general public isn't usually interested in.

The preservation room and the rear cafeteria are the scene of most of the ghostly occurrences.  Voices are heard here, and employees sometimes feel spectral hands touching them.
