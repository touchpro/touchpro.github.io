My old high school, Hamilton Township, was built in 1939 at the corner of Lockbourne and Rathmell Roads, replacing an even older building on Rohr Road which is currently divided into apartments.  At some point in the 1960's a tacky new building was attached to accommodate the growing district.  In 1985, the movie <i>Mischief</i> filmed interiors here, but that was long before I arrived.
<p>
The ghost of Hamilton is that of a man who supposedly hung himself in the rafters while they were building the old building.  Teachers whose word I respect claim to have heard his footsteps in the halls of the old building at night, when no one else is around.  Is it the hanging man, repeating his final walk through eternity?  I went to school there for four years and was in the old building late at night on several occasions, and I never heard or saw anything weirder than Mrs. Raver.  (Just kidding, Mrs. Raver; I love you for all you did for me.)  I'd really like to go back late at night sometime, though.
