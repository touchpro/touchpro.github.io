Engine House No. 16 in Columbus, located at 260 North Fourth Street, operated as a fire station between 1908 and 1981.  Today it houses the <a href = "http://fire.ci.columbus.oh.us/Museum.htm">Central Ohio Fire Museum</a>.  It is haunted by the snorting of ghostly horses--presumably those which were once stabled here to pull fire equipment.  Another ghost present at the fire house is that of Captain D--not the crusty sea captain of deep-fried fast food fame, but an old fire captain who used to obsessively check equipment.  He is said to continue this practice from beyond the grave.
