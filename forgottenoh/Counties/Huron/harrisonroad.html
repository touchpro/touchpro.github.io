The Harrisons were one of the original families in Huron County.  Grandfather Harrison immigrated to the United States from Ireland, married an Indian woman, and raised children on his vast estate, which included a farm and vineyard.  Today his ghost travels from the family graveyard to the vineyard via Harrison Road, which is supposed to be off US 20 west of Wakeman.  The closest Harrison Road I can find these days, however, is north of I-80/90 in Erie County.  At any rate, he carries a red lantern, which is often seen bobbing alongside the road as old man Harrison checks on his old homestead.
