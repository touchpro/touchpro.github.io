Outside of Dresden off Route 208 is the haunted Episcopal cemetery, named for a church which once stood nearby until it burned to the ground a few years ago.  People who visit the graveyard report a weird feeling, "like being watched."  And they frequently encounter the same apparition:  a man dressed in workboots, coveralls, and a winter hat.  He looks like a mechanic or a tow truck driver, and he will approach your car, only to disappear before he reaches it.  If you shine a flashlight beam in his direction it will pass right through him.
