Muskingum County's oddest haunting has to be the appearances of Stumpy the Man-Faced Dog.  Stumpy first appeared near Norwich, in the Allen Glen neighborhood, sometime in the early 1800s.  He once tugged a young girl's sleeve and then ran away, but not before she and her brother got a good look at him.  He then spooked horses and cattle in the area for some time, and even jumped into a carriage beside a doctor going on a housecall.  Today there is an area near Norwich known as "Stumpy's Hollow."  Although he hasn't been seen lately, you might run into him if you're out there late at night.
