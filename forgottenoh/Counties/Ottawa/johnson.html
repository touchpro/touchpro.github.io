Very little remains of the Confederate POW camp that once occupied Johnson's Island in Sandusky Bay.  Today you can reach it by highway bridge and see the cemetery where so many rebel soldiers were buried, far from home.  (See also <a href = "../../Cemeteries/campchase.html">Camp Chase Confederate Cemetery</a> in Columbus.)
<p>
Legend has it that the ghosts of the soldiers stand up from their graves and march south, in formation, across the bay and toward home.  Workers at the stone quarry saw them one day in the early 1900s while taking shelter from a storm under the cemetery trees.
