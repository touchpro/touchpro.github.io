The ghost of Tom Lyons, known as "the ugliest man who ever lived," is said to roam Mohican State Park in Richland County.  Lyons was an indian who supposedly wore a necklace decorated with the tongues of 99 white men.  He vowed that he would get a hundredth before he died, but his plans were interrupted when he was killed on the stagecoach road and thrown into Killbuck Swamp.  Now he roams the paths of the park with his axe, motivated by rage at being deprived of his last tongue.  I don't imagine being called the ugliest man who ever lived makes him too happy, either.
