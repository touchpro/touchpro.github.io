Oak Hill Cottage in Mansfield was built in 1847 for John Robinson.  It was sold in 1864 to Johannes and Frances Jones, great-uncle and -aunt to author Louis Bromfield, who played there as a child.  The Joneses would go on to die there--Mrs. Jones on December 12, 1912 (12-12-12), at 12:15 (close enough).  Today the Richland County Historical Society owns the building, which stands at 310 Springmill Street.
<p>
Oak Hill is said to be haunted by the Joneses, and has such a dark "atmosphere" that some visitors refuse to enter.  Check it out and let me know what a dark atmosphere looks like.
