Dean's Hollow is a creepy area in Lorain County near Vermilion which is home to several legends.  One of them is the Heartbeat Bridge on Deans Road, just off Route 60, where you will hear a heartbeat if you turn your car off.  The bridge is also said to be guarded by some sort of evil creature which occasionally massacres people and hangs them from the bridge beams.

One explanation that I've heard is that the bridge's heartbeat is caused by a nearby oil derrick.  That explanation makes more sense to me than living bridges or murderous monsters, but hey, who knows?
