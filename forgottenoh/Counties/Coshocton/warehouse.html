The Warehouse in Roscoe, Coshocton County, is home to the ghost of an old lady who died there, as well as a ghostly child.  Particularly haunted is the laundry in the sub-cellar.

The following story was sent to me by a Coshocton County police officer:

I'm a Deputy Sheriff here in Coshocton County.  In the fall of '90 (I 
believe) I found the side door of the Old Warehouse open.  It was 
around 3:00 A.M. when another officer and I were searching the building 
(routine).  We had done a quick walk through of the first floor, then went to the basement where Lock 27 (pub area) is located.  Our shift sergeant had 
arrived at the front of the building but remained at his car (parked at 
the front door).  We had been in the Lock area only a couple minutes when 
we heard footsteps running down from the second floor and heard the front 
door open and shut.  It sounded as if the door was <i>flung</i> open.  Of course we ran to the front door and outside expecting to see the Sarge in a foot pursuit.  When we got outside, Sarge was sitting on the front of his car 
looking very bored.  We asked him where the person went that ran out of 
the building and he looked at us as if we had lost our minds.  I think to 
this day he believes that we were just messing with him, but it still gives 
me goosebumps when I tell the story.
