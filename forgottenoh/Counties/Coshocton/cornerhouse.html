In Coshocton County, an abandoned house at the intersection of State Routes 541 and 79 is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a man who came home, found that his wife had not made him dinner, and cut off her head and put it in the oven.  Who can blame him, really?
<p>
Today "hot drafts" are felt in the vicinity of the house.  Screams are heard, and you can sometimes smell burning flesh.
