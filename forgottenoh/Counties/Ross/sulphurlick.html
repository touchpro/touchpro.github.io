The old, abandoned hotel on Sulphur Lick Road (reachable via Maple Grove Road or Route 550) has long been known as haunted by residents of Ross County.  The story goes that a woman, the wife of the owner, found evidence that he had cheated on her, and went berserk over the course of one night.  She murdered him, then proceeded to dispatch each of the guests in their rooms.  The blood stains can still be seen inside.  They say the place has been purchased and may be turned into a bed and breakfast someday, but so far it hasn't been fixed up; maybe that's because the ghosts of the murder victims never left.
