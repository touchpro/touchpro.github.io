Located near Chillicothe off Route 50 is Schrader Road.  Part of Schrader goes through a railroad tunnel.  Supposedly a woman put her baby on the tracks to get rid of it, and to this day if you drive through with your lights off and windows down at night you can hear the baby crying.  Or maybe she slit the baby's throat and hung herself.  It depends on which version you hear.  Fun stuff.
<p>
The other ghost haunting the Schrader Road Tunnel is that of a woman who was murdered and whose body was hung from a tree branch in a rubber waterbed mattress over the creek at the north end of the tunnel.  She's supposed to reappear from time to time.

<br>
You might also run into cold spots in the tunnel or have blood drip onto you from above, so wear an old shirt.
