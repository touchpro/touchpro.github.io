The ruin of a house on Pine Bluff Road near Fallsburg is haunted by the ghost of a crazy dentist who murdered his family and buried them in the backyard.  Or so they say.  You might see balls of light floating around the property or past the broken windows inside.
<p>
According to more skeptical local sources, the dentist who once owned the house left it to his wife, who lived there alone for several decades.  When she passed away it was left empty and placed into trust.  The poor condition has to do with a tree falling on it, aggravated by the continuous vandalism by liquored-up teenagers.
