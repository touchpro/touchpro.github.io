A woman who froze to death in the mid-1800s can be seen walking the railroad tracks near County Road 10 in Belmont County, also known as Black Oak Road.  She was a black servant whose mistress fell ill in the wintertime.  She was sent on foot into the nearest town, Flushing, to get the doctor, but she never made it.  If you happen to be driving County Road 10 on the right winter night, you might see her huddled figure retracing that cold journey on the tracks between Lafferty and Flushing.
