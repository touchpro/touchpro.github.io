The ghost of a gravedigger haunts an old township road near Morristown known as Buttermilk Run.  It's named after the ghost town of Buttermilk, the last signs of which were obliterated by strip mining in the 1960s.
<p>
The township gravedigger was preparing to fill in a grave after a winter funeral when a sudden blizzard hit.  He froze to death eating his lunch, crouched down against a fencepost for shelter.
<p>
Although more than a hundred years have passed and the area has been completely changed by dams and stripmines, the gravedigger's ghost still haunts the "saddle" in the road near the old cemetery.  He carries a kerosene lantern from one end to the other.  If you show up on the right night you might see the glow from his lantern bobbing down the road.
