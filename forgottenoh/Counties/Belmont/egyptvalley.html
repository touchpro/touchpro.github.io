The area known as Egypt Valley in Belmont County near Holloway is said to be haunted by several different ghosts.  It's a very spooky place at night.  You can find it on both sides of Piedmont Lake, as the map above shows.
<p>
One of the ghosts of the Egypt Valley is that of Louisa Catharine Fox, whose gravestone stands in Salem Cemetery.  Salem is a pre-Civil War graveyard in the Valley with several legends of its own.  It's said that unmarked graves there belong to witches.  Another legend states that if you walk around the graveyard six times, you will disappear.
<p>
The Louisa Fox story is a gruesome one.  She was being courted by Thomas D. Carr, a "notorious character" and local coalminer, when she was only fourteen years old.  He had met her when she'd come to live at his brother-in-law's house.  He wanted to marry her, and her parents apparently consented, but Louisa's parents later broke their promise and the wedding was cancelled.  When he caught Louisa going home on January 21, 1869, an enraged Carr murdered her with a razor.
<p>
Carr made a halfhearted suicide attempt after he killed his fiancee by slashing his own throat and even trying to shoot himself, but it wasn't enough to do the job.  When he was arrested his wounds were treated.
<p>
An "intensely exciting" five-day trial ensued, conducted before Judge Way.  Carr, who was born in Sugar Hill, West Virginia in 1846 and was apparently a pretty scary character, laughed when his death sentence was read aloud and said he did "not care a damn if it was to be tomorrow."  
<p>
On March 8, 1870, while waiting to be hung, Carr made a full confession, which included the admission that he'd murdered fourteen other people in his life and attempted at least five.  If true this makes him a fairly prolific serial killer.  His confession was published in pamphlet form and read throughout the Ohio Valley.  On March 24, 1870, Thomas D. Carr would become the first person legally hung in Belmont County.
<p>
Louisa Fox's gravestone states that she was murdered by Carr.  There is another marker dedicated to her, a few miles from Salem Cemetery--this one marks the place where she was killed.  People leave flowers and stuffed animals at this marker from time to time.

As horrific as the Carr-Fox murder story is, it's not the only ghostly occurrence associated with Egypt Valley.  Nearby is the site of another ghostly occurrence:  a phantom house.  It appears to visitors with seven red candles in the windows, but always fades away when approached.
<p>
Other stories center around a cemetery which borders the preserve near a lake with a steep ledge.  Supposedly a dozing truck driver wrecked into this cemetery and lost his arm when his truck rolled on it.  Although the trucker lived, his severed arm was never found, and the story says that the <i>trucker's severed arm</i> now roams the cemetery, apparently using its fingers as legs like Thing from the Addams Family.  You can hear its skittering walk on still nights.  You might also hear the "devil dogs," which are not U.S. Marines but rather actual evil canines which may or may not guard the cemetery.  I wonder how the severed arm avoids getting picked up by one of the devil dogs. 
<p>
With all these scary stories, the Egypt Valley has to be counted as one of Ohio's scarier places.  The thought of poor Louisa Catharine Fox roaming the woods at night is awful enough, but the homicidal specter of crazy old Thomas Carr is even worse.  If you happen to come across either of them and make it back alive, please let me know about it.
