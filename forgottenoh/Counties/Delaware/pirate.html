A ghostly woman of European extraction wanders the banks of Scioto River just south of Delaware, near a place where a pirate named John Robinson once built his castle-like home.  The woman showed up shortly after he finished building, and was seen on the banks of the river late at night.  Then she disappeared.  Today the castle is gone but some people say her ghost still roams the Scioto.  If you're there late at night you might also hear her "bloodcurdling screams."  Robinson murdered her, apparently.
<p>
This Delaware County ghost happens to take her late-night strolls very near the skeletal ruins of <a href = "../../CarpentersMill/carpentersmill.html">Carpenters Mill</a>, an Ohio ghost town with its own interesting history.  When you go looking for the ghost of Robinson's lady don't forget to leave yourself time to explore the mill as well.
