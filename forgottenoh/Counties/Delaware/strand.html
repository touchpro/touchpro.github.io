This movie theater is housed in an old vaudeville theater that was built nearly a hundred years ago.  Today it's owned by Ohio Wesleyan University and shows first-run movies.  Backstage and behind the scenes, the theater is a maze of hidden storage rooms and unused theatrical recesses.  It is haunted by two ghosts, one mean and one nice.  The mean one appears standing near the entrance with a scowl on his face; he frightens people and generates bad vibes all over the theater.  The nice one is generally accepted to be the ghost of Rodney, a theater employee who died in a house fire in 1987.  Some think that a former owner named Cindy haunts it as well; the aroma of her perfume sometimes fills the air.
