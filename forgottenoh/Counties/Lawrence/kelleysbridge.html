A guy called "Uncle John" LeMasters died on State Route 93 near Kelley's Bridge in the 1930s when he was struck by a car.  This happened about five miles from Ironton.  Since then there have been reports of a ghostly dog seen running across the road at the exact spot.  Whether or not Uncle John had a dog is not known.
