Vesuvius Furnace Mine

The mines near Vesuvius Furnace are haunted by the ghost of a man who lost his life in a mishap there.  Each night he brings his wheelbarrow out of the opening, walks around for a while, and then goes back in.
<p>
The devil was also encountered there once, many years back, but when a local minister asked him what he wanted, no one bothered to record his reply.
