A tunnel in Ironton, once part of old State Route 75, is said to be haunted by the ghosts of children who died in a school bus fire inside it.  It was closed off when Route 93 was built but later reopened as a historical landmark.  Now the VFW conducts a haunted house there every Halloween.
<p>
It seems that the bus fire story is completely false.  No such event ever occurred; they just made the story up to go with the haunted house.  Then again, how many of the events behind supposedly haunted places really took place?  Not many.  I leave it up here as an interesting bit of creepy folklore.
