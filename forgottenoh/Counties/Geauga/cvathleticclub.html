Was a little girl really beaten to death in this building?  In the nineteenth century it was a schoolhouse, and rumor has it that the schoomistress was cruel to the students.  One girl couldn’t take the whipping she was given and ended up dead.  Now people in the Athletic Club library claim to hear the striking of a whip, as well as the forlorn cries of a small child.
