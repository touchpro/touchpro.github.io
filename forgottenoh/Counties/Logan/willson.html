This campground and conference center, located on County Road 11 in Bellefontaine, has been around since 1918.  One of the cabins on park land is a relocated log cabin from the pioneer days in Logan County, and it is well known around the camp as haunted.  The ghost--whoever or whatever it is--does not like men, and is more active when males are inside.  Knocking sounds are reported on the door and the walls.  Creepiest of all, kids who sleep there during summer camp often start "speaking in tongues" for no apparent reason.  Possession by the ghost?
