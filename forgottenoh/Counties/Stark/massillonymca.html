The paranormal activity at Massillon's YMCA is reportedly so gruesome that at least half the staff refuses to visit parts of the building--specifically the third and fourth floors, which were once a homeless shelter and the site of all sorts of violence.  Bloodstains are still visible on some of the floorboards on levels three and four.

Maids have reported having their keys stolen, only to find them in a room they had not yet entered.  Sometimes rooms they clean will be trashed again immediately, even though no one else has been in.  Creaking noises and knocks emanate from the walls.  Shouts are heard from the basketball court even when it's not being used.
