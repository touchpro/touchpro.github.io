Egypt Road near the Mahoning County line has its own crybaby bridge legend.  A baby just barely old enough to walk ran from his front door while his parents were fighting.  The mother spotted him as he reached a bridge nearby and ran after him, but she was a moment too late and the baby fell to his death in the creek.  Today you can hear crying there at night, as well as the scream of the baby's mother as she runs to save him.
