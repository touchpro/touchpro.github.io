Bowman's Cemetery in Rogers is supposed to be haunted.  A witch supposedly killed children here and was hung from a big tree.  This cemetery also contains a grave with a huge, deep crack in it that you can stick your entire arm down, if you're brave.  It's located on Lusk Lock Road, far back in the woods.
