A burned-down house on Hisey Road in New Waterford is haunted by the ghost of 15-year-old Rick Cooper, who committed suicide there in 1990.  He hung himself in the barn, where the family had a two-car garage.  If you pull into the driveway you will be facing the place where he killed himself.  A figure in white has been seen roaming the grounds.
