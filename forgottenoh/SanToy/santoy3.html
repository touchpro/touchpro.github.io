Today, the miners' homes in San Toy, Ohio, have been reduced to foundations--truncated brick walls overgrown with weeds.  Trees sprout up through many of them.

The buildings were torn down around 1940, when the lumber was sold off.  Apparently only the foundations were brick.  Today if you walk through the field you'll just about break an ankle tripping on loose bricks.

But what San Toy consists of today is mostly foundations.  They're everywhere on either side of the road, stretching back into the trees.  These were mostly miner's homes, and pacing the diameter of the brick foundations gives you an idea of the conditions they lived in.

It's fascinating to think about the people that once inhabited these structures.  Their lives went on here and then they left.  I would really like to hear from anyone whose family was from San Toy--so drop me a line if you have any info.
