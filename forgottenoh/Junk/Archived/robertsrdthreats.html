Funny stuff.  First of all, I'll have to fill you in on some backstory.
<p>
There is a section in my Franklin County hauntings about the specters of an axe murder who supposedly haunt <a href = "Counties/Franklin/robertshouse.html">the home where the tragedy took place</a> off Roberts Road in Hilliard, at the place where the road jogs, near a public school.  If you're heading west on Roberts away from I-270 and the city of Columbus, the school will be on the right as Roberts comes to its little jog, where you turn left and then right again to stay on it.  While you're on the jog part, the Roberts Road haunted house is on your right.  It's currently abandoned, though it may be under renovation.  You know how vacant buildings are.
<p>
A while back I received this e-mail from the irate owner of the property where the house sits.  Her e-mail address is <a href = "mailto:Holly2342@aol.com">Holly2342@aol.com</a>, and she writes:

<p>
My name is Dianna Green and I am the owner of the house on Roberts Rd.  The house has been in my family since the day it was built.  Unfortunately the information you have reported is completely false and is causing vandalism and burglary on my property.  I would appreciate it if you would promptly remove this false information from your site.  I have contacted the attorney general on this matter and you will be hearing from my attorney if you do remove this information.  The house is currently being renovated and these acts of vandalism are becoming more than just a nuisance.
<p>
Thank you for your prompt response.<font color = "white">

Which is all well and good, although I can't take items down from the website just because they cause a nuisance for some property owner.  I'm amassing a collection of ghost stories here, and if I omitted every one that offended anybody, I'd never get ahead.  The legends aren't my fault; in fact, I wait for two people to independently contact me with a ghost story about a particular place before I put it up--sort of a "double confirmation" standard, which I think is the best you can do when you're dealing with something as tenuous as folklore.
<p>
But the really hilarious part comes next.  Ms. Green seems reasonable enough, aside from that silly stuff about being able to sue me, but her enforcers stepped in next, presumably after she talked to an attorney or realized how little she can actually do to force someone to change their website to suit her convenience.  I did apologize for her trouble, and even added a disclaimer to the Roberts Road Haunted House page, which you can see here:

The strongarm people, such as they are, started e-mailing me today, August 15, 2003, while I was at work, and when I got home I had about a hundred e-mails from them for some reason.  Most of them said the same thing.  Here is a sampling:
<p>
<font color = "yellow">
FUCK U!
<p>
TAKE .. THE .. ROBERTS .. ROAD .. HOUSE .. OFF
<p>
TAKE THE ROBERTS ROAD HOUSE OFF YOUR SITE!  [Over and over again!]
<p>
Hey, I am asking that you please take the Roberts Road House off your website.  It's not funny at all.

<p>
These all come from <b>Traci Hughes</b>, whose e-mail address is sometimes <a href = "mailto:xopaquexsoulx@yahoo.com"><b>xopaquexsoulx@yahoo.com</b></a> (that was when she wrote the most reasonable of her commands, the last one), and sometimes <a href = "mailto:httraci@hotmail.com"><b>httraci@hotmail.com</b></a>.  My favorite of the subjects of her e-mails is DIE BASTARD.  She also made some disparaging comments about my girlfriend--the basics like "slut" and "whore" and all that fun stuff.
<p>
Oddly enough, httraci@hotmail.com took the time to send me this picture of a girl flipping the camera off.  I wonder if it's her.  At any rate, here it is in all its glory.

The other tough guy sent after me by the Roberts Road Haunted House crew was someone with the AOL e-mail account <a href = "mailto:TheSunOwnsYou@aol.com"><b>TheSunOwnsYou@aol.com</b></a>.  This person just sent me a bunch of e-mails that say <font color = "yellow">"Take the Roberts Rd. site off your site."<font color = "white">.
<p>
And I haven't even gotten to <a href = "mailto:MyUnderwearOwnsYou@netscape.net"><b>MyUnderwearOwnsYou@netscape.net</b></a>, whose favorite e-mail subject is FUCK U, and who writes <font color = "yellow">"stupid motherfucking cunt, take the roberts road house off your stupid ass website."<font color = "white">
<p>
Needless to say, this is all cracking me up.  Maybe it's because it's so late as I write this, but I think this is the funniest thing to come out of the website yet.  They're so upset!  And all over one little page on my website.  I'd love some input on this issue, just to get some other peoples' take on the matter.<!-- text below generated by server.
