If he became a famous author, Andrew Henderson could say he trespassed his way to success. 
<p>
Henderson, a 23-year-old Ohio State University student, sneaks into utility tunnels, abandoned prisons and derelict hotels for the thrill of it. 
<p>
He chronicles his adventures at www.forgottenohio.com. 
<p>
The Web site caught the attention of a Chicago publishing company that was planning a book series on the types of buildings Henderson likes to explore. 
<p>
"They came to me," said Henderson, an English major. "I was really flattered. I'm still in college, you know." 
<p>
The book, Forgotten Columbus (Arcadia, $19.99), offers a pictorial history of landmark buildings, some long since demolished. 
<p>
Although it doesn't concern his illegal hobby, the volume does feature several photographs that he -- or fellow explorers -- snapped during excursions. 
<p>
The rest of the photos are from the Columbus Metropolitan Library collection. 
<p>
Henderson has prowled old buildings for several years. 
<p>
The practice is something of a national trend, called "urban exploration" (or "infiltration") by its adherents. It's also illegal and dangerous: Henderson admits having had close calls with falling bricks and rotting floors. 
<p>
He finally stopped sneaking into an abandoned prison in Roseville after becoming ill all three times he entered. 
<p>
"Never again -- it's a scary place," he said. 
<p>
Henderson has never been caught. 
<p>
"Never been arrested, never even came close. But I'm really, really cautious. I get made fun of for being so cautious." 
<p>
The honorable urban explorer has a code of conduct: Don't vandalize, don't steal from and, any more than necessary, don't disturb a site. 
<p>
The book pictures many buildings that, were they still standing, an explorer would no doubt love to infiltrate. 
<p>
The cover features the mammoth Central Ohio Lunatic Asylum, later called the Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital. 
<p>
Often billed as the largest building in the world under one roof, the institution for the mentally ill was demolished in the 1990s. 
<p>
Also long gone are most vestiges of the empire of Dr. Samuel Brubaker Hartman. 
<p>
The doctor -- who made a fortune selling Peruna, a patent medicine that was 28 percent alcohol -- built a hotel, plants and a theater Downtown. 
<p>
His Hartman Farm south of Columbus was a sprawling beef and dairy operation that Henderson speculates may have contributed to the nickname "Cowtown." 
<p>
Among surviving landmarks, the long-empty Seneca Hotel, recently purchased for redevelopment, is a Henderson favorite. 
<p>
"I've been inside three times," he writes on his Web site. 
<p>
He encountered several homeless people, including one smoking crack, in the E. Broad Street building. 
<p>
"No one tried to kill us or anything, but it's still most definitely not advisable to go by yourself." 
<p>
His book also examines the old Ohio Penitentiary, the Fort Hayes complex and several OSU buildings. 
<p>
Henderson hopes to do books on Cleveland and Cincinnati. 
<p>
He also is eyeing an empty missile silo in Colorado that he'd like to explore.
