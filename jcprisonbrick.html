Since the Junction City Prison was really only there to make bricks, they were equipped with extensive brick-making facilities.  The brick furnaces are housed in a building near the prison which is already in the process of being knocked down.  When my girlfriend and I visited it the first time, the front rooms were in their final days.  On our first return trip they had demolished the two front sections.

The furnaces were used in <I>Brubaker</I> very briefly.  They're just enormous, with heavy round metal doors on the ends.  There are even two levels of furnaces; the second level is accessible at the top of a catwalk.

The furnaces are awesome.  At the front of the building there's a sort of workroom with workbenches and pegboards--well, there <I>was</I> a work room there, until they knocked it down.  When I was first looking for the prison a pickup truck-driving local told me they were getting ready to demolish the whole place and turn it into a lumber yard.  You hear imminent demolition stories about just about any place, but who knows?
