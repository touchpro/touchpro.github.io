Who doesn't love a good abandoned prison?  They're great places to explore, which is why it's so unfortunate that they get demolished so frequently.  The Ohio Penitentiary dated to the 1830's, but they knocked it down to build a hockey stadium.  Mansfield's State Reformatory is being restored, but now that it's occupied it's no longer a real prospect for infiltration.  The Boys' Industrial School in Lancaster has been taken over by an adult prison.

But every once in a while you get lucky and stumble across one.  The Junction City Correctional Institution in Perry County is one I stumbled across a few months ago.

I've come across surprisingly little information about the history of this building, which I first heard about from a friend of mine in Lancaster.  After a lot of looking I've determined that it was a satellite of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, a brick-making factory which employed prison labor.  Good-behavior convicts from the Pen were sent here to make bricks in the furnaces.  The bricks went to state building projects, including institutional structures and streets.  Interestingly, the Junction City brickmaking prison had a sister institution, also governed by the administration of the Ohio Pen, just outside the town of Roseville and across the county line into Muskingum County.  That one is also abandoned; look for a page on it ASAP.

In 1927 a guard was killed by two prisoners during an escape attempt at the Juntion City Prison.  The building must have been built prior to that, but I'm not sure of the exact year.

The most interesting chapter in the history of the Junction City Prison was the 1980 filming of the Robert Redford film <I>Brubaker</I>.  Redford plays a progressive warden who turns a brutal and failing prison around.  The movie also featured Yaphet Kotto, David Keith, and Morgan Freeman.  The movie was set in Arkansas, but they used Ohio as a substitute.  It's funny that the plot of the movie has the prison (called Wakefield State in the script) falling apart, with the ceiling caving in at one point.  When they wanted a crappy old prison building, they came here.  If you visit the prison and watch the movie you can see where everything is.  Brubaker lived in a house which is still standing across a field from the prison.  The movie was set in Arkansas, but they used Ohio as a substitute.  When it came out, the governor of Arkansas was a thirty-something guy named Bill Clinton.  Clinton appeared on <i>The Today Show</i> to respond to Redford's allegations about substandard prison conditions in his state.

As you can see, one of the structures remaining from the <i>Brubaker</i> days is the guard tower.  Click below to view some photos of it as it appears today.

I don't think they filmed <I>Brubaker</I> using real prisoners, so the building must have been unused by 1980.  Since then it was actually occupied briefly by a pizza place, of sorts; the company that occupied the prison made frozen pizza kits for charities to sell.  The frozen pizza place occupied the newer, one-story cinderblock wing of the prison.  I don't know what they were called, but if it wasn't Big House Pizza, they really missed out.  They left a couple of ovens behind, as well as a mysterious toxic white powder you'll read more about later.

Since then the place has been falling more and more into disrepair.  Just about every pane of glass in the windows has been broken.  It's not even boarded up or sealed very well; the gates in the tall barbed-wire fence have been knocked aside or flattened, and the doors stand wide open.  People must explore this place pretty regularly.

I visited the Junction City Prison several times in the first half of 2001, mostly with my girlfriend.  We even went at night.  It's not haunted that I know of, but the place is still plenty creepy after dark.  Even though it's not as massive as most prisons, the Junction City Prison still stands a good four stories and spreads down the length of an acute angle formed by two roads.

The brick-making shop is right next door to the prison--for now.  It's in the process of being demolished.  To visit it, click below.
